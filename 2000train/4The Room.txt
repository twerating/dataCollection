The #Colts fake punt was like the movie "The Room". What made it so legendarily bad is the creators truly believed they had something good.
"[...] and are just trying to make us believe they are just airing the Room. Or they may just want you to watch the movie and are [...]"
The movie would've been better if they just focused on the 2 in the room and took out the detective plot that was needed
Me & Jordon were the only people in the room at the movies and we were watching a scary movie needless to say everything scared us
I like just being on the couch, the room dark af, and a movie playing as I just sit there, super relaxed. Best feeling ever.
