@kreutzerland TUSK IS MY FAVORITE BAD HORROR MOVIE, OH MY GOD
Anyone seen the movie #Tusk ? It's on Amazon Prime and I'm thinking of giving it a chance..I love Kevin Smith but idk this seems...weird
so basically, the movie "tusk" is a live action version of the south park episode where kyle's dad has surgery to be a dolphin.

@toddwhaines @sneakyvarmint Have you seen the movie? TUSK?
i was really happy and then i remembers that the movie tusk existed
After finishing Tusk, Emily has informed me I'm not allowed to pick the movie anymore.
Seriously no tusk movie at target
I'm pained to admit that I hated #YogaHosers, but I have no idea what audience the movie was for. To go from Tusk to this makes no sense
just watched the movie tusk... it cannot be unseen. #Tusk
For anyone interested in a good sit down movie, me and @kararaedecker suggest Mr.Tusk
there comes a point where too much pot has adverse effects. the movie tusk proves it. just finished watching it. wtf, @ThatKevinSmith?

@ThatKevinSmith just finished #Tusk....dude. Awesome flick. Watching extras now. Movie was a trip. Tight to see a podcast idea come to life.
Det. Frank Garmin haha amazing. Johnny Depp is equally amazing. This movie is gnarly as fuck. @ThatKevinSmith @RalphGarman #Tusk #WalrusYes
@ThatKevinSmith just finished Tusk, really enjoyed it best movie I've watched in a while! Seriously no words to describe how much I liked it
@ThatKevinSmith Your 'The Tusk'...I have no comments.I was crying and laughing throughout the whole movie so sincerely like never before.Tnx
Damn Tusk is the most disturbing movie I've ever watched
@ThatKevinSmith Finally saw Tusk after seeing you in Melbourne last week. Fucking weird movie, but I really enjoyed it. Kudos. #walrusyes
@ThatKevinSmith the girls just made my day in this movie! #tusk
Tusk was the weirdest movie I've ever seen in my life but I couldn't stop laughing
The walruses must have watched a screening of @ThatKevinSmith movie, TUSK http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dead-walruses-found-on-alaska-beach/ …
So there can now be an elephant boxing movie called "South Tusk". https://twitter.com/uberfacts/status/647852428365299712 …
@FilmGeekArmy Watched the movie tusk, thought it was good movie but totally creeped me out
i think #Hidden was the best movie i've seen this year o.O #dystopia thou #Tusk made a good impression lol
@ThatKevinSmith Tusk is fantastic! Love that movie. Can't wait for your next movies!!!
Seriously @ThatKevinSmith. Tusk was bad in a way I cannot even define. I worry this movie might define your legacy even more than Clerks.
@ThatKevinSmith just watched "tusk"... I saw some bad reviews but I was quite entertained by this movie.
Can't even look at this normal because of that Mr Tusk movie https://twitter.com/female_books/status/647599256711393281 …
If you haven't seen the movie tusk, i highly recommend watching it asap
I thought The Human Centipede was a fucked up movie. Then I watched Tusk.
@ThatKevinSmith regardless of critics, I think 'Tusk' is a brilliant movie... It's genuinely frightening. Kudos.
Btw if people wanna see a funny movie watch TUSK :D
I've finally found a movie more disturbing than human centipede... TUSK
. @LimitedPaper i watched tusk for the first time, on really good acid, not knowing what it the movie was really about hahahah
Has anyone seen the movie Tusk? I'm out here RATTTLED. More so than human centipede
Most fucked up movie I've ever watched is now TUSK
Man like Lord Tusk coming through with the movie soundtracks https://instagram.com/p/7_LINIpxFF/ 
Yes I took my senior pictures with a walrus because of @ThatKevinSmith movie tusk pic.twitter.com/YMwGZPcSlA
Last night's movie: "Tusk" (2014). Obnoxious podcaster visits mysterious man in Canadian backwoods, is trapped. Bizarre horror/comedy. 8/10
I accidentally watched this movie 'tusk' ya go watch it
Tusk was a very weird/cool movie
Tusk was dark, but good. Great @ThatKevinSmith movie. If you haven't seen it. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Maybe during the day though
Watching this horror movie #ItFollows . This is the craziest movie I have ever seen in my life behind #Tusk. Seriously.
@BradBirdA113 - Don't start back peddling now. Make a movie that you want to see. Kevin Smith did it with Tusk. You seen Tusk right. Right?
Watching TUSK. Great movie @ThatKevinSmith. Another great picture
@ThatKevinSmith finally saw Tusk and oh my god what a movie. So refreshing, creative, and new. Can't wait for the rest of the trilogy!:)
Pro tip... Never watch the movie tusk... You won't regret it.
Tusk is such a weird movie...
Yikes TUSK is the strangest horror movie I've seen since THE BABY (1973) -- actually similar ending. @ThatKevinSmith
“Tusk Vegas” by MOVIE. is my new jam. Listen: http://t.thisismyjam.com/chrlsh3/_aildlon …
Watching Tusk. I'm gonna need a lot of alcohol to get me through this movie...
@cinemasins Have you seen @ThatKevinSmith 's movie TUSK? Curious what you thoughts out it. #WalrusYes pic.twitter.com/1xtH8Hd1p1
Excuse my random movie commentary...but I feel compelled to share my journey thru #Tusk with u, @ThatKevinSmith. More to come!
PS Isn't #Tusk such a fckd up movie? 44mins left & I'm traumatized. Guess that means it was done right More props @ThatKevinSmith
shout out to the director who made The Tusk, that movie is fucking disgusting
@justinlong love Tusk and all it represents so much. Finishing my violent "children's book" because of this movie
OK, Johnny Depp. This is your last chance to convince me you can be in a movie without Morticai/Tusk/Wonka/Lone Ranger-ing it up.
// Okay, I had no idea Tusk was directed by Kevin Smith and TARANTINO HAD A CAMEO ROLE. I'M BOUGHT. I AM SO WATCHING THIS MOVIE. YALL DIDNT+
@ThatKevinSmith I LOVE that you made Tusk and I #WalrusYes, but I will never watch that movie again. It's too disturbing. LOL!!!
The movie #Tusk is a mind-bender. It will spoil #Walrus for your whole life, so watch at your own risk. I give a 5/5 - overall. #IMDB
@justinlong Watching #Tusk now. FUCK ANYONE who disses that movie. Youre amazing as usual. As is Michael Parks. @ThatKevinSmith #WalrusYES
I knew REDACTED showed up at some point in the movie. Early on, I figured it might be the mysterious 'doctor' that Parks referred to #Tusk
Anybody ever seen the Kevin Smith movie Tusk?
Listening to the #Tusk commentary. Movie's so full of smodcast inside jokes it makes MCU fan service look positively restrained
Tusk is a weird movie.... it reminds me of human centiped but awful and about walruses
If u haven't seen the movie Tusk, don't .. If you have I'm so sorry.. Every time I hear or see the word Walrus I start to freak.. Nightmares
Finally watched #Tusk last night. Odd beast of a movie. Bits worked really well, other bits didn't. Some strange choices made
Have you guys seen the trailer for the movie tusk?! It looks so disturbing fuck I'm so creeped out
Tusk is the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. Kevin Smith is a great and underrated filmmaker. Watch it.
@ThatKevinSmith I watched Tusk for date night. It was AMAZING. However she said she picks the movie next time haha. You really did that tho!

Tusk is the most weirdest movie everrrr!!!
Johnny Depp plays a French detective in the movie Tusk, and it's really funny.
Watching this dinosaur movie w the kids & it's playing Tusk by FWM as if I wouldn't notice... Sly

@ThatKevinSmith tusk was my second favorite movie from last year so that's all that matters tbh fuck the box office
Watching @ThatKevinSmith ''s #Tusk. Weirdest movie I've seen in a while.
This movie was intense. So freaking good! Johnny Depp's best work since Tusk. #blackmass… https://instagram.com/p/7wkEV4MqbF/ 
Johnny Depp's best role is clearly in the overwhelmingly fantastic movie Tusk.
Watching the most fucked up movie #tusk @ThatKevinSmith

the movie tusk made me cry
Watch the movie Tusk. Probably the most weirdest and disturbing film I've seen.
just saw the movie "TUSK" lol Wtf Kevin Smith...is it a comedy? Not all Canadians say "aboot" bro
First date idea: Watch the movie Tusk and recreate it
@QQ_wolf @ThatKindAnon Remember the Kevin Smith Movie about the dude being turned into ... "Tusk" I think.
I'm so disgusted by the movie tusk ... I feel physically sick after seeing just a couple seconds of it
I indulge in a crappy movie occasionally. Tonight it's Tusk. Then Google Earth decides to give me this wallpaper. pic.twitter.com/Cs3A6YjULH
Hanging out, watching Tusk. I love this movie. pic.twitter.com/kmKFpJlJ1Q
Late night movie #Tusk
Listened to the movie Tusk while working today. It maybe actually be creepier without the visuals. The score is fucking tops
Tusk is the weirdest movie I've ever seen
@ThatKevinSmith stop apologizing for tusk. It is the greatest horror movie I have ever seen no shit
@DevonESawa That is the truth. I love him in @ThatKevinSmith movie Tusk. He should rock yoga hosers. He is good at making a roll his own.
Tusk is a horrible movie. Can't believe they made it because a hashtag told them to. Avoid it like Moviebob avoids exercise.
Everybody knows that Johnny Depp's best movie is Tusk
@UncleVicious79 every time I see him I think of the movie Tusk
I know @ThatKevinSmith gets tons of attention for Clerks, and Tusk, but #Dogma will always be my favorite Kevin Smith movie.
The @ThatKevinSmith movie Tusk is on Amazon Prime, I'll check that out! I loved Red State.
stayed up to watch TUSK. bat shit crazy movie, bad ending. i think? yes?
@ThatKevinSmith Tusk was a god-awful masterpiece. Or a magnificent train-wreck. Still not sure which. But I loved it. Best worst movie ever.
I watched a scene from the movie #Tusk, and now I feel disturbed
I've never had a movie make me wtf the whole time AND I still liked it. Bravo @ThatKevinSmith! #walrusyes Tusk-go watch it!
Tusk is by far the most fucked up movie I've ever seen. I'm so angry.
Thats why you don't go over strange ppl houses, this movie tusk is wild
So I'm about to watch this movie tusk ... mmm yeah we are going to see how this goes

Have any of you ever seen the movie tusk?
@marcellvspqr @ThatKevinSmith Tusk: a great movie! Wasn't what I had expected.
I just saw the movie Tusk. I hate myself.
Watching this movie titled TUSK, where this old man turns this travelling podcaster into a Walrus. This is funny and serious.
THIS MOVIE TUSK IS SO FUCKED UP
Someone give me a movie to watch that isn't tusk
@ThatKevinSmith I finally watched Tusk. Awesome movie!
@DanzNewz Have you seen Tusk? Its the type of movie where you laugh but the movie is serious! Movie Night time! pic.twitter.com/p0lzh0UQDQ
I really love the use of Fleetwood Mac’s “Tusk” in the opening of that movie. Great tune.
Getting ready for family movie night! Watching Home with the boy, and after he's in bed, hubby and I are watching Tusk.
Watching the movie 'Tusk'. Half way through now.. What The Fuck.

Tusk is the worst movie

!!Urgent!! update requiring everyone to see the movie TUSK!!!! Not sure what it is?? It's only one step down from scarface so it's gooooood!
Didn't even finish it. Tusk is a fucking failure of a movie.
Mom's fav movie rn is Tusk&psyched for Yoga Hosers..She always ignored @ThatKevinSmith movies cause of his Degrassi love so it's a victory.
Continuing my @ThatKevinSmith movie marathon with #ChasingAmy already done #Tusk #JnSBSB #CLERKSII
For the record, and not without some irony, the last movie I saw before doing the @hansislandradio podcast was @ThatKevinSmith's "Tusk".
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/qVsM2nDc8Uc?a  Tusk - Movie Review
My new favorite @ThatKevinSmith movie is #Tusk Loved it!
The kid from the Sixth Sense is in this movie, all grown up. #Tusk
TUSK IS SUCH A FUCKED UP MOVIE
Don't watch the Kevin smith movie 'tusk'. That is indeed some disturbing shit.
No it was not RT @tyt271254: @headkrack Tusk was a bad movie
If this movie "TUSK" was about turning someone surgically to a wolf. Everything that is hole, fantasy going to overdrive
"Tusk" A movie about a mad man wanting to surgically change another man to a walrus. Interesting TF choice

The movie Tusk fucked me up
a guy at school was talking to me about this movie called tusk and tbh it looks disgusting and unnecessary but i kind of want to watch it
Two words : 'f***ing' and 'insane'. Is there any way I can unsee this movie? #Tusk pic.twitter.com/OgJoiPx8x6
Just watched the trailer for the movie @tuskthemovie and I'm well and truly terrified! #horrorfilm #tusk
@RobbazTube have you ever seen the movie 'Tusk'?
the movie "tusk" has actually caused me to have a PTSD attack any time I see a walrus
After watching the movie Tusk, I now hate Kevin Smith
like the movie "Tusk" is about a guy that gets kidnapped and turned into a damn walrus ffs
@sherryjenix I just watched Tusk with @elviswestcoast , greatest shittiest movie I've ever seen...
@ThatKevinSmith & @justinlong I just watched Tusk, well I'm still watching it; but what a great movie, this is awesome
If you enjoyed the movie Tusk, I'm just gonna go ahead and assume you're a serial killer
Tusk is the scariest movie I've ever seen, in both my post and pre adolescence. It beat Silence of the Lambs. #tusk #kevinsmith
Was that movie Tusk supposed to be funny? Cause I thought it was hilarious
Well done!!!!!! #movie #tusk #walrusyes
Watched a movie called "Tusk" today. Still don't know what I watched.

@RufusHound Tusk was the best movie I watched in 2015. I cannot believe people thought it was shit. It is brilliant. Have watched it 4 times
do yourselves a favor and NEVER watch the movie tusk
Same people that like Coheed and Cambria probably also thought TUSK was a good movie
Wow Tusk was a weird movie. Walrus Justin Long just screamed the whole time & chubby Haley Joel Osment is there just watching it all happen.
Just watched the movie #tusk...wtf.
I can not even begin to explain how ridiculous this movie is #Tusk @justinlong is killing me!
Tusk was an interesting movie...to say the least.
Tusk is my fav movie ever
@ADAMATOMIC Have you heard of a movie called tusk? #walrusyes

"Tusk", a movie from @ThatKevinSmith, well acted, quirky & quite honestly rather creepy. Definitely worth a few hours of your time.

Watched the movie Tusk last night. Still a bit too uncomfortable to decide if I loved it or not. @ThatKevinSmith

I just remembered that the movie Tusk exists and it just makes me so happy
@ThatKevinSmith @tuskthemovie tusk just happens to be this amazingly interesting movie, so glad it was made!
Movie review: TUSK @tuskthemovie begs the question... What the fuck did I just watch? Also, @HaleyJoelOsment is still alive.
@ThatKevinSmith tusk was an experience and I enjoyed it! Haters will hate! Where is there walrus movie #nowalrus
@ThatKevinSmith @tuskthemovie @Villian09 Tusk was the shit!!! Loved that movie!!!

@tuskthemovie @YogaHosers @MarcHammrWriter TUSK I loved it.I hated it, all in one movie. I can only get that from @ThatKevinSmith. Thx kev
@ThatKevinSmith wether or not tusk was good or bad is kinda moot, its a movie that proves you can do anything if you want it hard enough

@ThatKevinSmith @tuskthemovie @YogaHosers I really want to watch Tusk. It looks awesome. That and Horns. :) I need a movie night soon.

Dreams of memories. Or memories of dreams. 'Tusk', a short movie by @rory_wt for the @RCAeducation via @vimeo http://ow.ly/RbskQ 
Is Tusk the greatest or worst movie of all time?
This movie doesn't work without Michael Parks, he is terrifying. Also walrus Justin Long disgusts me. #Tusk
I am fairly certain that the movie "Tusk" has scarred me for life.
@ThatKevinSmith Great job, I got hopes up for you. Remember "Tusk" I do please let this movie make me forget it. #tuskstillhauntsme
There's a douche bag behind me going on about how awesome the Spawn movie was. He reminds me of Justin Long from Tusk. Pre-walrus.
If you want to watch the weirdest movie ever.. Watch tusk.. I don't even know what to think right now
Stop. Everything. This is a real movie??? Have you seen this? How have I missed it!? Lol #Tusk https://instagram.com/p/6n_NrTofXX/

Watched @ThatKevinSmith movie "tusk" I thought it was a fantastic, disturbing film. Well done
♫ Movie - Tusk Vegas (3:23) #detektorfm #np
So, after putting it off for a while, I finally watched #Tusk. Weirdest movie I've ever seen, but I'm glad it was made. @ThatKevinSmith
@ThatKevinSmith Can't wait for that movie, absolutely loved TUSK! But please get our accent right. We don't say "aboot" we say "aboat". ;)
( the tusk is one hella disgusting of a movie and with no purpose, the fuck. )
There's a movie called tusk dudes get abducted and turned into a walrus
What the fuck is this movie? #tusk
Disney is making a Jungle Cruise movie. It's about plastic elephant tusk poachers.
@MatthewSantoro the movie tusk has a human walrus
@ThatKevinSmith your movie tusk fucked me up in the most brilliant of ways, please never stop making movies. The world needs your flicks.
I have a strange obsession with this Tusk movie now. Thanks a heap @ThatKevinSmith
Two things. One, I might unfollow. Two, Tusk is THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Do you hear me? WORST. IN ALL OF TIME.
@ThatKevinSmith just saw tusk. Still shaking. Why did u make the movie? Why? WHY? Kidding, enjoyed the movie, can't get it out if my head.
Probably should've watched it sooner . . but god damn Tusk was one fucked up movie
https://player.vimeo.com/video/134560750  #Tusk #movie #animation
@laurenarae try to watch tusk the movie it is hands down then worst thing u will experience
Just watched the weirdest movie where Justin Long is held hostage by a psycho and turned into a walrus. It's Misery meets SeaWorld. #Tusk
Tusk is the weirdest effing movie known to mankind fyi
So the Movie, Tusk. This old dude turns a man into a Walrus. Seriously.. It's absurd
Half way through the movie Tusk, and it fkn sucks!!
@AgeOfMyself @NexusFromBricki I get what makes other movies appealing, that isn't Tusks appeal. Tusk is a movie for Smodcast storytelling
Tusk is such a fucked up movie
Don't watch "Tusk". Must be Kevin Smith's worst movie...
Anyone who doesn't think Tusk is a great movie can fight me.
That's fucking sick man the movie tusk grossed me out #Tusk
Tusk Amazon Instant Video ~ Justin Long http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N8MCC4Y/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_rSt0vb0YN6T4S … via @amazon This movie should be banned. It crosses boundaries for viewing.
I just finished watching the movie, Tusk. I have no words. I have never seen anything like that in my entire life. I am changed.
I think the only "scary" movie I've seen that fucked me up for a bit was Tusk
This is an actual movie? Garbage — watching Tusk
@ThatKevinSmith How about we use Tusk as a box office measurement for movies. The new FF movie made 77 tusks so far. Avatar? 1488 tusks
Patrick made me watch the movie Tusk last night. I'm still processing what I saw.

Watching 20 years to tusk and @ThatKevinSmith is a fucking Genius! Honestly this makes me want to start my terrible movie ideas!
I'm watching Tusk and crafting with my friend. This movie is a masterpiece. #fullwalrus
So I watched a movie called TUSK.....it was the weirdest thing I have ever watched in my LIFE
In a crowded field, Kevin Smith's Tusk is easily the best movie about a guy who gets abducted and surgically altered to look like a walrus.
Rewatching @ThatKevinSmith's Tusk. Michael Parks is brilliant and Justin Long is perfect. Great movie.
@ThatKevinSmith Tusk was one messed up movie man. You're a sick puppy
Just watched Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf That was by far the worst movie of all time. That was worse than Tusk, Chef, Horns, and Year One.
@ThatKevinSmith @fandomfest @JayMewes should continue Mr Tusk's story in next movie Will Mr Tusk become a dad? Lol
@ThatKevinSmith wow u made a good #horror movie #wtf mr Tusk
This movie is fucked up #Tusk #horror
Tusk is a strange movie.
That movie is as effed up as Tusk
#Tusk is probably the most original movie I've seen in ages. Well done, @ThatKevinSmith, well done.
Just watched that movie TUSK..... like wtf man
#Tusk is one strange movie.... What a fantastic job Michael Parks did in playing a complete lunatic! #SeriouslyFuckedUp #LovedIt

Alright... Tusk is probably the weirdest, creepiest movie I've ever seen. @ElizabethMeese is a terrible movie picker
By the way, the movie Tusk was @gallifreak's pick. I blame my wasted time on him.

Tusk is the most messed up, but hilarious movie I’ve ever seen. I’ve never laughed so hard that I’ve cried before.
@ejectpants @erenseyebrows I dare you to watch "Tusk" (a movie where dude gets turned into a walrus)
@ThatKevinSmith Tusk is a great movie. For me is a great "Misery's" tribute where Park rapresent the storyteller (director) with true heart
The movie Tusk is so strange
im halfway through the movie [TUSK] & jfc it is disgusting plus the fact that is based on an actual story... why did phil watch this lmao

Watched Tusk for the first time. Although its not the best @ThatKevinSmith movie, its weird and fun and i fucking love it. #GuyLapointe
@ThatKevinSmith just caught Tusk. Brilliant movie, creepy as fuck. Brilliant horror
Not long into Tusk and already I can sense this is going to be a messy movie
Tusk is a better movie than @ThatKevinSmith would have you believe. I did not-see that coming. Michael Parks is a national treasure.

@ThatKevinSmith just watched TUSK for the first time, excellent job on the movie and the non-happy ending, love it #walrusyes
I just saw the movie tusk and I'll I have to say is. .........
Why are we watching a movie about Justin Long getting turned into a walrus? #Tusk
Don't get me wrong, Tusk was a great movie. But there was just something...off-putting about it. And not the obvious.
The podcast where Kevin Smith got the idea to make that mental movie Tusk! I remember listening to this. Smodcast 259 http://youtu.be/sj932CDnRFU 
Finally saw @thatkevinsmith Tusk. If anything, I'm impressed at the dedication to make a horror movie about a Walrus-man happen.

Tusk is the best mind fuck of a movie.
Every day I think about the movie tusk
Before #Tusk: "Oh, let's watch this #KevinSmith movie!". After #Tusk: "What on earth did we just watch?!"
If you've never seen the movie Tusk, please go watch it. Johnny Depp is wonderful.
Finally watching #Tusk. Surprisingly good horror comedy that succeeds in delivering a fun weird movie.
Watched the film #TUSK. What a weird movie
The movie tusk is the craziest, most twisted, most messed up movie that I have ever seen. And I can never look at a walrus ever again.
This movie Tusk is bananas!
@colinuggets Tusk made me feel new things. That rarely happens in a movie. I experienced emotions I never have before.
I highly recommend the movie Tusk for everyone ever
Tusk is the most fucked up movie evertr
@TaraReid Have you seen @ThatKevinSmith's movie Tusk? Can you and @planetjedward be in one like that next? Or a role in Terminator!
Tusk is a terrible movie, don't do it
I've been listening to @ThatKevinSmith long enough that I figured I should just watch Tusk. It was less a horror movie and more just weird.
To say tusk is the weirdest movie I have seen in a while is a huge understatement #walrus
Finally watching Tusk. What the actual fuck is this movie.

@mmaddiejo Should I ask her change to the movie "TUSK" maybe will better a little bit
The movie Tusk is wild

I was hoping one of you guys would bring up Tusk. Lol crazy ass movie @dpshow @HiMyNameIsSeton
@HiMyNameIsSeton the movie is tusk and walrus not seal
@HiMyNameIsSeton the @ThatKevinSmith movie was Tusk. And it was a walrus, not a seal. But yeah, it was twisted
@HiMyNameIsSeton Tusk is the movie strange as hell!! #haleyjoel #kevinsmith
@dpshow @PaulPabst @HiMyNameIsSeton #fail on the @ThatKevinSmith movie it's #Tusk and its a Walrus not seals.
@PaulPabst Fred Willard..? That movie is Tusk
@ThatKevinSmith I'm gonna go home and watch every movie you have ever touched from clerks to tusk I'm looking forward to @YogaHosers
#Tusk was one F'd up movie
So I watched Tusk today... And that's definitely a movie that was made.
This movie 'tusk' is SO messed up
@tylergposey have you seen the movie tusk? If you have not don't watch it
@fleetwoodmac Tusk is playing on this children's dinosaur movie. Pretty much the only time I've ever gotten pumped for a dinosaur movie.
Tusk might be the dumbest movie I've ever seen.

@OpieRadio He was in @ThatKevinSmith movie tusk !!
@OpieRadio @JimNorton @travistefft Haley Osment was in @ThatKevinSmith last movie, #TUSK
Word of advice for those I love. DONT EVER WATCH THE MOVIE "TUSK."
If you were thinking abt watching the movie Tusk, do NOT
So who wants to go see Yoga Hosers when it comes out in 2016? It's a Kevin Smith movie and if you agree I say watch Tusk before
tusk is a cool movie man
@loudmouth_usa have you seen the movie Tusk?
@PaigeRaeleen there's this movie called tusk idk if its on Netflix but its about a guy who gets turned into a walrus and its scary
@ZADF_ORG @ThatKevinSmith thats going to be awesome because #tusk was a awesome movie !!
Tusk is the weirdest movie ever dont watch it (even tho Johnny Depp is in it)
Just when the premise seems absolutely absurd & unbelievable, the movie Tusk is actually pretty good. F***ed up. Lol. But still pretty good.
@TODAYshow If @ThatKevinSmith can make #Tusk then we can get a legit movie out of #ManUnderTheStairs. Lets make it happen!
@ThatKevinSmith I just watched Tusk. Solid movie, Kev. It was super creepy, even scary at times. Definitely not an every day movie :)

I hung up my Tusk movie poster tonight (it's signed-I didn't even know that) and I forgot how TERRIFYING it would be to see before bed
Finally checking out @thatkevinsmith's movie #Tusk. Hope it's as crazy as a lot of people say. https://instagram.com/p/5D99axBBqq/ 
Tusk is a fucked up movie
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/CDijrBIMN1M?a  Tusk Movie CLIP - Cana-don't's (2014) - Harley Morenstein Walrus Horror Comedy HD

So, yeah...The movie Tusk. Made me feel weird. Ha
I think #TUSK just became my new favorite movie. @ThatKevinSmith @justinlong
Since I am a veteran of a weekly Bad Movie Night, I don't think I can fairly judge Tusk. But I will and I loved it.
Justin long always gets the shit end of the stick :'( watching this horrific movie #tusk I
Tusk is, quite possibly, the stupidest movie that I have ever seen. So stupid that it was absolutely amazing.
Just watched the movie #Tusk ...very bizarre movie
@CultOfVivian if you have time, watch the movie Tusk by @ThatKevinSmith. It's accurately describes how a social justice walrus is made.
the movie tusk ruined me and I've never even seen it
whisky & @thatkevinsmith movie #Tusk should help this arsehole of a summer cold!! #sick #flu #movie… https://instagram.com/p/5AdRGID5Gd/ 
Basically if TUSK and words like "great" & "b-movie" are associated I blackout and wake up with dead bodies suddenly everywhere.
Just had a 'Nam type flashback about my ex-boss tying to convince me that TUSK was great & shitty on purpose because it's a B movie.
I just finished watching Tusk.. let me tell you, this movie is just one big "WHAT DID I JUST WATCH" as soon as it starts
Watching #Tusk this movie is fucking crazy....
@EUCouncilPress @eucopresident Tusk could play lead role in movie, Dumb & Dumber. Debt restructuring = sustainable plan for growth. #idiot
Permanently screwed up from just watching the movie "Tusk". #what #why
"Johnny Depp was really excited to return to the world of TUSK." - Kevin Smith on the 2nd movie in the TRUE NORTH trilogy. #SDCC #HallH
#tusk is hilarious! The walrus suit is classic B movie stuff.
In May 2011, Polish PM Donald Tusk gave U.S. Pres. @BarackObama a gift of an IPAD w/ this movie loaded on it - http://goo.gl/P9obYt 
The movie Tusk is hands down the most disturbing movie I've seen.
H & I watched Tusk last night. I would like a warning label about movies like this: "Movie only enjoyed by cult followers."

Tusk was funny, horrifying, great movie. So twisted and dark at certain parts, so light hearted in others. #WALRUSYES
Watched @ThatKevinSmith movie Tusk. Expected it to be bad & wasn't disappointed. What a waste of time for everyone involved. Had potential.
Tusk is by far the greatest @ThatKevinSmith movie of all time.
@Gamechanger22 Kevin Smiths last movie 'Tusk' made me cry
Tusk is the worst and sickest movie I have ever seen in my life.
Still disturbed from having watched Tusk. Really disturbing movie.
@IMDb I bet @ThatKevinSmith loves it... Maybe he will have some ideas and a voice! Would love to see a Tusk meets Batman type of movie!
@LaurenBelke tusk the movie >>>>

If you ever see the movie "Tusk" while walking through a movie store, pick up said DVD, throw it as far as you can, and run the other way.
#Tusk is a disturbingly insane but captivating movie.
Finally getting to watch @ThatKevinSmith 's movie Tusk. Been looking forward to this.

@WimbledonAlley NO NO NO NO NO I ONLY HAVE MOVIE POSTERS UP (one is tusk which is a movie u should watch ;) ;) ;) )
Tusk is the weirdest fucking movie ever
I wager @ThatKevinSmith would actually sell his Tusk movie at furry conventions if he marketed it as a transformation fetish piece.
Showed my gf every @ThatKevinSmith movie, yet when I showed her a 30 second clip of Tusk she was like "nope nope nope"
@ThatKevinSmith tusk is one disturbing movie you crazy genius. #Tusk
I don't understand why @ThatKevinSmith shits on Tusk. It wasn't a perfect movie but it wasn't awful. #WalrusYes People still talk about it.

@ThatKevinSmith how awesome would it be if they made a new Dragnet movie starring Ralph as Joe Friday doing the voice he did in tusk?
@ThatKevinSmith I drove an hr to see Tusk, you put Jay & Silent Bob in Moosejaws, I'll drive ANYWHERE to see that movie!
@ThatKevinSmith #Tusk gave my girlfriend nightmares after seeing the tusk costume. We both love the movie man. No reason to bad mouth it.
Ok, the fuck was up with Tusk?! Best most disturbing movie ever
@ThatKevinSmith yoga hosers a tween movie??? Still take all my money. I will be at the theater opening day, like I was for tusk
Watching Tusk, a Kevin Smith movie about Justin Long turning into a walrus. Or something? Honestly have no damn idea
Tusk has to be the weirdest movie ever created...ever
So in the movie #Tusk, is it me or does it look like #BryanCranston #Confused
Kojima likes the movie Tusk and now my world is crashing down around me.

Whoever thought of the plot for the movie "Tusk" has a fucked up mind
Watched that Kevin smith movie tusk boy was that weird..
So far the weirdest thing about "Tusk" is not a man being turned into a walrus, but that Johnny Depp agreed to be in this movie.
If you ever want to watch a seriously fucked up movie watch tusk.
Tusk is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen.....
I watched a little movie called Tusk today so I know what Canadians are like. #FIFAWWC #Can #Eng
Tonight's movie is Tusk by director K. Smith. It's about "a brash podcaster (Justin Long - Die Hard 4.0)" so it will definitely be good.
Lots of good things to ponder on from the words of the mad scientist in the movie "Tusk." His violation as a little boy produced a monster.

Finally watching Tusk! Best part of the movie is @HarleyPlays and hisaccurate portrait of a Canadian boarder guard! pic.twitter.com/kem8ELmi2e
NEVER SEE THE MOVIE TUSK PLEASE DONT DO IT
I say that because Tusk was the one movie I hadn't seen in the previews on this disk for Life After Beth. I'm taking a lil break from OITNB.
I feel like I should have a movie night double feature of Zombeavers and Tusk. Both look equally ridiculous.
@ThatKevinSmith Just watched Tusk for the 1st time. What a good movie. Thanks for making it. Not trying to kiss ass, but... film needs you.
*That's why I had time to see it. I think the lady movie I saw on a theater was Tusk.
#Tusk just got insanely weird 1 hour in. And I was already in the edge of not really liking this movie that much.
Saw @ThatKevinSmith movie Tusk last night. Thought it was pretty rad. Justin Long has never looked so good as when he's in that Walrus suit.
@TheAmyNicholson glad u called Devin out about Tusk. I enjoyed that movie & I think he wouldn't have been so harsh if it wasn't Smith too!
Tusk is not a great movie, but whoever designed the Japanese poster made it looks super cool. https://twitter.com/eigacom/status/609669150537953280 …
This movie #Tusk is fucking terrifying and also seems to be a quintessentially Canadian (so, weird) take on the horror genre.
Never watch the movie "Tusk" .. Most disturbing thing I've ever seen
If you want to watch a really weird ass movie then watch tusk :-)
So I'm watching this movie Tusk....Yea....its weird.
Just watched TUSK by @ThatKevinSmith...Mind blown. Totally awesome movie! WTF you guys are crazy.
TUSK IS THE WEIRDEST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE IM CRYING
Shopping tomorrow to get the masterpiece that is @ThatKevinSmith's Tusk on DVD. Hilarious movie #WalrusYes
we watched tusk why does that movie exist
About to watch the movie Tusk & I'm so scared
@ThatKevinSmith @YogaHosers @people I can't wait for this movie to release. Been looking forward to it since I saw them in #Tusk
After a trek to 3 different shopping centres in Dublin I finally got @ThatKevinSmith's new movie "Tusk." It better be worth it, Kev.
That movie Tusk looks kinda crazy man. Idk how i feel about that trailer.
Tusk is the weirdest movie (besides human centipede) and I don't understand why Johnny Depp is in it.
I'm pretty sure the most fucked up movie I have ever seen is Tusk
Watching the greatest movie of our generation for a 3rd time, Tusk. This film needs to be seen by all.
@ThatKevinSmith finally got the chance to watch tusk. Possible most terrifying movie ever, but still hilarious. How ironic :) GREAT JOB!!!!!
Japanese TV talked about just Johnny Depp and his daughter in the movie #Tusk but the movie is so shocking!!!i love it tho.
@Jasmine_Rose10 @MarissaRuda tusk is the best movie of all time
#Movie #Tusk @justinlong @genirodriguez @HaleyJoelOsment @john_c_depp http://youtu.be/5-4ILmlf9f0

@Ghosthi2 While you wait for him watch the movie tusk ;3
if u want to watch a scary movie pls watch Tusk its my favorite!!!!!!!!!!! its really great quality and has a really good plot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tusk is the craziest movie I've ever seen someone pls help
Tusk is the most disgustingly hilarious movie i've ever seen
Had the privilege of watching the movie Tusk tonight. Glad I got to learn a lot more about people turning into walruses. #ComedyOrTragedy
Never watch the movie "Tusk" I repeat Never watch the movie "Tusk" !!!
TUSK, minus the Johnny Depp interlude, holds up massively as a weirdly poetic monster movie pastiche.

listening to the podcast that created Tusk and I'm soo happy this movie exists even getting into it on a late pass
@ChrisPereira Need I remind you of that freak of nature film Tusk? You were pretty upset during that movie and that one is beyond ridiculous
@ThatKevinSmith @tuskthemovie @STARBURST_MAG #WalrusYes movie was awesome #Tusk #WalrusYes
@SonyPicsAtHome @SonyPicturesUK Why no UK Blu-ray release for Tusk? @ThatKevinSmith fans are real movie fans and want the best version
if you want to see a fucked up movie go watch Tusk
In May 2011, Polish PM Donald Tusk gave U.S. Pres. @BarackObama a gift of an IPAD w/ this movie loaded on it - http://goo.gl/P9obYt 
@ThatKevinSmith I finally have gotten around, to seeing Tusk. It was a great movie, and a really odd one, too.
I watched that movie Tusk last night and the best part was seeing Justin Long scream as a walrus. Fuck that guy.
Tusk is such a messed movie

Just watched movie #Tusk & its absurd! A lame ending & even lamer #Canadian jokes. Super Dave should slap some sense into the director eh?
"My left me after I missed the birth of our child. I was in the theater watching Tusk. I'm so ashamed. Why was Johnny Depp in that movie?"

If you're looking for a movie to watch with that special someone, try one of the following: •Tusk •Sharknado •Sharknado 2 •Zombeavers
must see the movie TUSK
Tusk is a very disturbing movie
Y'all should watch the movie Tusk..oh hell no gmfu
If a movie is ever described as a "body horror comedy," safe to say you could skip it *ahem* TUSK (except you should see it to feel my pain)
There's this weird movie called tusk and some ugly seal that's all stitched up kills..
@TheKyleStarks TUSK ends with a human being living in a zoo. It is maybe the dumbest movie ending in history.
Toss up between Serendipity or Tusk. We went with the movie about the guy being transformed into a walrus. #GirlsNite #ToughCrowd
After watching the movie Tusk all I can say is never go full walrus... Ever!
Tusk was the weirdest movie I've seen in so long. I'm at a loss for words.

@BethFerrengirl tusk I have not seen yet either. Have you seen Jay and Silent bob's super groovy cartoon movie?
Just caught #Tusk on Movie Central up in Canada eh, awesomely creepy movie!! @ThatKevinSmith @SModcastNetwork @smosier
@ThatKevinSmith please stop bashing tusk. I wouldnt have found myself without you making that movie. It has value.
Just finished @ThatKevinSmith Tusk, great movie. Check it out if you have seen it. #WalrusYes
If anyone wants a recap of the movie "Tusk" watch my story
"I have my name in the credits of that movie (Tusk)" "What?" "Yeah." *explains contest rules* "Only you would know that, Dylan"
tusk is the most bizarre movie ever made
@MickiEllen try the movie Tusk, I think you'll like it a whole lot better
If I'd never listened to a SModcast, and didn know "Tusk" was an @ThatKevinSmith movie, I doubt I'd peg him as the writer/director. (1/2)
@phantasm2 Michael Parks is GOLD in Tusk. He absolutely owns that movie.

@ThatKevinSmith finally got to see tusk. Was looking forward making a top movie list. But my soul hurts now and I need to cry. Thumbs up
Can't find the TUSK theme anywhere (the one in the latter half of the trailer and many scenes in the movie).
Tusk is a very messed up movie
Please get rid of that damn movie "Tusk". The worst movie that I've EVER seen. Im still annoyed a day later that I spent 1.61 on it @Redbox
Holy shit, Tusk is on Movie Central on Demand. Thank you Monday for kicking ass. #WalrusYes. @ThatKevinSmith

I saw Kevin Smith's TUSK yesterday & it was really good fun for a movie conceived as a podcast joke. The language was relatively restrained.
#Tusk. Weird movie. Glad I watched it though. I've now seen all the movies @ThatKevinSmith wrote. I still don't hate Jersey Girl. #WalrusYes
Friday PM, relaxing after Rangers got kicked out. Got fooled by "comedy" rating of Tusk movie. Weirdest & most twisted I've seen in a while

Tusk is such a strange movie.
If you haven't seen the movie "Tusk", DONT.
Just watched 20 minutes of the movie Tusk! What the fuck was that ?!
Watching Tusk from the creative mind of @ThatKevinSmith. This movie is beyond brilliantly twisted.

The movie Tusk, was the biggest fucking waste of time. I can't believe I was excited to see it. Honestly a waste of two hours!! Lmao
Man. Just remembered how great that movie Tusk was.
Love @ThatKevinSmith and some of the crazy humor but #tusk was a 3 star movie at best, wish i was wrong. Johnny Depp made me laugh in that.
. @netflix Hi Netflix, just wondering if you guys could add "Tusk" (2014) to your movie list. Such a great movie, it'd be great! =)
@lim_tusk @tjshubs idk how he thought it was good unless he's never seen a movie before
Have you guys watched this weird horror movie Tusk?

Y'all have no idea how much I love the movie Tusk
If you are scrolling thru your TV guide and come across the movie 'Tusk', for the love of God, keep scrolling.
well, I have now seen one of the worst movies of my entire life. Tusk, a movie made, I believe, in the vein of Human Centipede, only dummer,
@GreenEyesCatC you're talking about Tusk? That movie made me shudder!
@ThatKevinSmith don't think I've ever laughed, cringed, and even teared up watching just one movie before. But Tusk did that. Sorry I waited

Lol fucking tusk what a cute movie
I would rather set myself on fire and throw myself into a highway then watch the movie Tusk :)
Whoever thought of the movie Tusk has serious mental issues
Unless you want to see a movie where Justin Long is severely mutilated to look like a walrus, please don't watch Tusk.
Tusk is the weirdest movie I think I've ever watched. Thanks to @ThatKevinSmith, I don't think I'll be sleeping tonight.

Never watch the movie TUSK holyyy fuck
There are people who actually like the movie "Tusk". Faith in humanity lost to never be found again.
Senpai, would you watch tusk with me, im scared :( — what is that? :( but i don't like horror movie too. http://ask.fm/a/c5d2n990 
@ThatKevinSmith, Wtf? Just watched Tusk. Almost puked. Great movie. Why'd you do that?! Wtf?
Just finished watching the awful movie Tusk, opefully the movie I'm watching now is better. It's a romantic comedy titled 50 Shades of Grey.
Two things about #Tusk: 1) Great horror movie! 2) What's wrong with you, Kevin!? (But still, great horror movie!)
@ThatKevinSmith's movie #Tusk is playing on The Movie Channel right now! Everyone go watch!
watched 2 movie tonight (actually one of them was just finishing it): 1. Tusk... http://fb.me/6BRYx2DkU 
Like most of Kevin Smith's career, Tusk is a movie that seems to start promisingly and then devolves into self-parody.
I miss old Kevin Smith comedy movies. Tusk was hands down his worst movie. Red State wasn't much better. I get branching off, but man......
That tusk movie is sick ! Lmao its funny as hell
If you haven't seen the movie tusk, watch it, trust me.
I feel like everyone excited for Mallrats 2 hasn't watched a Kevin Smith movie since the first Mallrats... Did you guys see TUSK!? 11/10!!1
#tusk is a disgusting movie! I'd watch Saw or Hostel any day over that
I just watched the movie Tusk.... I dare say that that movie was on par with The Human Centipede. #excusemylackofpropergrammar
Also take a moment to spoil the plot of his latest movie Tusk so you don't accidentally see it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusk_(2014_film) …
@ThatKevinSmith watched Tusk last night here in Alaska. Just wanted to say I thought it was a very well done movie that kept me engaged.
Lmao so its a movie okay, add into list after Tusk .cringes.
the movie Tusk is actually the creepiest and weirdest movie I have ever seen
TUSK IS THE WEIRDEST FUCKING MOVIE
@ThatKevinSmith watched Tusk, strange, funny and out there. But it's original and not another transformer movie. Can't wait for the rest!
Coming home and planning on eating some chicken or steak. Followed by a good movie Either clown or tusk! Not sure

The movie tusk made me hate the seal animal
Dude fuck that, ever since I saw that movie tusk, I can never look at walruses the same like they straight scare the shit out of me now
@ThatKevinSmith needs to stop hating on Tusk. I absolutely loved that movie. #walrusyes #buffalove
Tusk is a stupid ass movie that is also disgusting and creepy af. @Josefeeny @clamchowdashit
"Tusk is just the worst movie," I said to myself, and then Johnny Depp showed up to piss on its corpse.
tusk is a movie that someone thought of. its a movie that people spent time to create. time, effort, and money went into this movie.
hey so the movie tusk is on amazon prime video but not netflix. yeah
EVERYTIME I SEE A WALRUS I GET A FLASHBACKS FROM THAT MOVIE 'TUSK' THAT MOVIE RUINED WALRUSES FOR ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
@ThatKevinSmith dude, just watched your movie "Tusk"! Completely restored my relationship with The Lord. My life is the shit! #WalrusYes
@Tusk_You that's the name of the movie, I wasn't telling you to be quiet btw
tusk was indescribable who had an idea to make a movie like that
@DrGhett0Batman you ever seen his movie Tusk.
Finally getting around to watching Tusk and this movie is blowing my mind. Bravo!! @ThatKevinSmith
@siakfurler have you seen the movie tusk
The movie "Tusk" is OK, but it surely enforces some podcasters should be tortured and have their tongues cut out. #JohnnyDeppIsGuyLapointe
Apparently every time I make noodles the process reminds me of #Tusk movie ending scene. I've had this "reminder" 3 times now. Pls stop!
On another note, Tusk is a terrible movie. Don't watch it.
Tusk is not a good movie but I'm glad to see Kevin Smith evolve as a filmmaker, at least a little bit.
@tcampondatrack tusk is the only movie that I've been close to turning off bc it was so fucked up haha
Tusk is the second best movie to come out this year behind birdman
"Tusk"=meh. 1/2-hr podcast's worth of idea stretched into an awkwardly uneven feature. D. said, 1st time the credits ruined a movie for him.
The only horror movie I've been willing to watch lately is @ThatKevinSmith's Tusk. I'm not sure how to feel now.
I'm watching Tusk and as much as I love Kevin Smith and his films I gotta say this movie is crazy bad
Apparently I just halluninated that TUSK was a movie in the SAW series cause I just realized "wait, tusk is different from saw"
The movie tusk is THE most fucked up movie ever made.... But it rules
What's your favorite horror movie? — Tusk http://ask.fm/a/c702k7eb

Well, TUSK is a strange movie. It might be terrible, but it's the most interesting, watchable brand of terrible Kevin Smith's ever reached.
@jpodhoretz @EW After TUSK, I don't think I'll ever watch another Kevin Smith movie. I should have stopped after "Clerks."
Just watched the Kevin Smith movie Tusk and it really blew my mind. Crazy gory psycho-thriller.
I'm watching a different Justin Long movie and it turns out I CAN block out seeing him as a human walrus in Tusk. This is great news.
Brodie gave me a summary about the movie Tusk and I never want to see it
@AmazingPhil WHY DID I LOOK UP THE TUSK MOVIE??? ? OH RIGHT. BC I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA B HARMLESS. NO. I WAS VV WRONG.
I'm about to watch that Tusk movie starring @justinlong. Pray for me.
I seriously can't stop thinking about the movie "tusk" & it's been like 2 weeks
Tusk is the first movie I've seen that's equally as funny as it is horrific
@LinaCarolyn ohhhhhh you said tweet because of the movie tusk and that's what happened to him
Saw the movie Tusk last night. Hard to put into words how bizarre it is, but I strongly recommend giving it a watch.
the tusk movie was clearly dan's turn to choose a movie
@AmazingPhil I GOOGLED THE MOVIE TUSK TO SEE WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AND I AM SCARRED OH NO

@1nsanityGaming @jglen97 OMG TUSK hahaha I've seen the movie crazy
This movie tusk is literally worst case ontario
Just watched #Tusk by @ThatKevinSmith What a weird amazing movie!
I've finally had the pleasure of watching @ThatKevinSmith "Tusk", and all I can say is that was one walrus of a movie. No, wait... #walrusyes
Because of the movie tusk, I will never look at a walrus the same again
Hey @ThatKevinSmith I'm a huge fan of your work, seen it all multiple times. Just saw Tusk today and WTF!?! Pretty damn twisted movie. Haha!
@ThatKevinSmith Finally watched Tusk. Disturbingly good stuff. Finally got my wife to watch a horror movie.
@ThatKevinSmith I just got done watching Tusk and i must say it was amazing movie. Thank you sir
tusk is such a bad movie
Tusk... A guy turns another guy into a walrus. Still not the worst movie I've ever seen.
Guys check out the awesome MOVIE and their video for Tusk Vegas. ITS FRIDAY !!!! http://fb.me/44T1i7ELF 
Don't ever watch the movie Tusk. Please. Just don't.
Watch the movie Tusk
@GrimfulReality Oh ya, I ment walrus. the movie is Tusk.
@ThatKevinSmith #Tusk: cements a movie can be anything. Didn't buy world @ 1st, but making-of hooked me. Then sucked in- shows POWER of FILM

Watching @ThatKevinSmith #Tusk with the wife and sister in law. Love this movie so much. #walrusyes #idontwanttodieincanada
why is this beautiful song in a movie like tusk why
The movie Tusk is 100% genius. It has layering. When Justin Long went to visit the Kill Bill kid, he really did, as Michael Parks was in KB.
Now that I saw the movie Tusk, I gotta get the Walrus Man action figure from STAR WARS.
I saw #Tusk movie 10 months ago and l still can't get over it! Disturbing but magnificent at the same time.. Nicely done @ThatKevinSmith
PSA: never watch the movie Tusk if you know what's good for you
There is a movie like the human centipede but it's called tusk and the scientist is turning the other guy into a walrus
WTF IS UP WITH THE MOVIE TUSK!? MY INNOCENCE HAS BEEN DESTROYED..
Talking about tusk and @Swootery: I Really Love Walruses: The Movie
I recently watched the Kevin Smith movie Tusk. I'm pretty sure I was one of the few who really loved… https://instagram.com/p/2T6utpuwSC/ 
Tusk: easily the strangest, possibly most disturbing movie I've ever seen. 0 for 10, would not recommend.
Finally watching tusk, holy hell this movie is pretty funny, suspenseful, and quite the trip, fantastic work @ThatKevinSmith
@thatkevinsmith Just finished #Tusk ...serverely shaken. That movie is going to stay with me for life!. #LaPointe

The Horror movie #Tusk from @ThatKevinSmith starts out with podcasters! @couplethingspod
I liked 'Movie Review: Tusk (2014)' in the Loot Crate App http://road.ie/lootcrate 
So yea this movie, Tusk, was weird as fuck
@Brennan_G_ watch the movie Tusk, it's about walruses you'll love it.
In regards to the movie #Tusk I could have gone my whole life without that disturbing image.
Tbh, I liked the movie Tusk. But I also really do not like movies at all.
Tusk was interesting movie but the walrus was more convincing than Depp's accent. Creepy yet enjoyable if you're weird like me.
To hold onto your sanity, don't watch the movie Tusk.
@Mirandapandaa16 @_suppplexx find the movie "Tusk" if you wanna be grossed out
you know the "Tusk" movie thing was funny enough, but the fact the cover looks like Trott makes it so much better
just watched #Tusk a cross between centipede & a jerry lewis movie. and what a pleasant surprise to see Guy Lapointe! @ThatKevinSmith
What the hell, the movie "tusk" is so weird, like what even. It's so disturbing

Watched #tusk by #kevinsmith the other day. My only question being, did that movie actually just happen, or did I have a fever dream?
I don't care what anyone say--I love the movie #Tusk. I am glad @ThatKevinSmith made it.

I am thinking watching a Kevin Smith horror movie while getting ready for work may NOT have been my smartest move ever — watching Tusk
Finally took the time to watch Tusk. Wow, if you haven't seen this movie you need to, so damn good.

Tusk might be the funniest horror movie of all time
(Tusk is a movie, btw, where the villain's motivation is working thru his tragic relationship w/the walrus that saved his life.)
I just got through watching "Tusk". That movie was all kinds of f**ked up. It's the most f**ked up movie I've watched in a long time.

I had a Full Walrus nightmare last night again @robotafterall (from the movie Tusk) pic.twitter.com/FMQnjHHLAM
There aren't enough psychoactive / hallucinatory drugs in the world to make #Tusk a decent movie...
I have not been able to watch anything for like a week and last night I watched Tusk in bed. I can't believe that was an actual movie.
Tusk is without a doubt the most DISTURBING movie I have ever seen!! A nightmare!! I won't be able to look at a walrus the same. @justinlong
Tusk is a terrible movie
If you want to waste an hour and 40 minutes of your time watch the movie Tusk because this is the dumbest thing of all time.
Hey everyone here's a link to my most recent movie review Tusk! Check it out please! http://ohhhmoviereviews.tumblr.com/ 
If I was to recommend a movie to not watch, it would be Tusk.
I get nauseous every time I see anything about walruses ever since I've seen Tusk.... No one ever watch that movie.
Clearly the genius of "tusk" the movie is simply in its existence.

#Tusk was the weirdest nd most disturbing movie I've ever seen
@timkasher hey I know you're into horror flicks. Have you ever seen the movie "Tusk" ?
Watching the movie "Tusk" and I don't know what to think so far. It's rather slow to start. Maybe I'll just wait.
Tusk is the weirdest freaking movie I think I've ever seen lol
Tusk is a movie where an old man transforms Justin Long into a walrus. Just saved you nearly 2 hours of your time. You're welcome.
@deadcooI this the origin of the boy who accidentally cuts his own leg at TUSK movie @ThatKevinSmith
Watched #Tusk and legit cried because the animal sanctuary was in such poor condition. I missed the entire point of the movie. #spoilers
Never ever ever watch the movie tusk. Ever.
@willow_catelyn Man, that should've been the movie TUSK.
I don't think I've ever started a movie on Amazon prime with less intention of actually watching it than Tusk right now.
Slept for so long!! About to start the day I guess with TUSK the movie since I still have no seen it yet!!

Holy hell, @ThatKevinSmith I may be bit late on the Tusk train, but it was a great movie!!! Oh and I can't wait to see you at @c2e2 !
Movies don't get much worse than Kevin Smith's Tusk. Horrible and ugly movie.

Never watch Tusk... Don't do it. It is the creepiest movie of my life...
#Tusk but @HMMADNESS says the movie has no point. It's shock-value #horror, akin to the Human Centipede.
My mom didn't sleep because she was up contemplating the Universe & watched a movie called Tusk Man? Then added, I should've had half. #420
There's a lot of urination in this movie. #Tusk @ThatKevinSmith

Don't ever, ever, watch the movie Tusk, I guarantee you will vomit or cry in fear.
Just finished watching tusk for the first time. My god that movie is brilliant please make more horror at some point @ThatKevinSmith
Now that I think about it, Tusk is literally the move mentally disturbing movie I've ever seen.
Just watched the movie #tusk. And um wow that's one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. I cant even right now lol
@fapular it's a movie called tusk lol
This tusk movie is nuts. What the hell is going on here?
Tusk was...interesting? The movie was great until Depp's bumbling detective showed up. Still, it's the most tender horror comedy I've seen.

TUSK frustrating movie experience. You can see how good it might have been. But tone is jumbled, script uneven & repetitive. #movie #horror
Man, Justin Long's horror movie characters just can't catch a break. First Jeepers Creepers and now Tusk.
So I just started watching this movie called Tusk and I instantly think: My goodness, Haley Joel Osment has gotten a little big.
Finally watched #Tusk. Holy crap, what a movie! I would watch Michael Parks chew scenery forever. #WalrusYes @ThatKevinSmith
#movie Tusk (2014) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3099498/ … "Well I became acquainted with a walrus when I was lost at sea." 3/5 stars
Ryan and I watched Tusk last night and I'm not at all the same person now. That movie fucked me up good.
double-shoutout to @ThatKevinSmith for #tusk awesome movie and great nonspoiling trailer
@Boarhound Tusk sounds like an art movie about orcs in the modern world and I was very disappointed to discover that was not the case :(
Tusk  Full Movie in HD Quality: http://youtu.be/bDRq22p1A_E?a  via @YouTube
Anytime I see a seal it reminds me of Tusk,I shiver from the mere memory of that movie
@LuckyMcKee Loved Tusk. You can't say you want original, unique movies & hate on that flick. That movie gets genuinely batshit bananas.
Someone just told me about the movie Tusk. I'm beyond disturbed
Finally saw #Tusk today. All I'm going to say is, @ThatKevinSmith, I am really glad you made that movie. I will see it more than one time.
Tusk. A superbly filmed movie by Kevin Smith. That should never have been written. Should never have been made.
Tonight's movie is the Kevin Smith directed 'Tusk'. Wish me and the film luck.
help what movie should I watch?? •Tusk •As Above, So Below •The Fault In Our Stars
@MattTheBold You should see the new Kevin Smith movie, Tusk!
Tusk RT @NaptownStar_: RT this with the worst movie you ever watched
Just watched Tusk... thanks @ThatKevinSmith I will never look at a walrus the same ever again. Awesome movie though!
Tusk is beyond the weirdest movie that has ever been made. Don't see it.
Who likes a movie so much they get a tattoo of it? My son #tusk @ThatKevinSmith pic.twitter.com/5nlPen5Ohi
For real, life advice, don't EVER watch the movie "tusk" quite possibly the worst/stupidest movie I have ever seen #wtfwasthat
@justinlong Big Fan of the movie #Tusk pic.twitter.com/Pz1HG7JEjI
I only turn a movie off if it's really, really, REALLY bad and TUSK is just really bad.
What is the most nastiest thing you have seen ? — I saw the movie tusk and if that's not bad idk what is http://ask.fm/a/bqhqi279

Just watched the movie Tusk....um yep....that was a movie alright.
I finally got around to seeing Tusk. Even for a movie essentially filmed on a dare, it's pretty fucked up.
Watched a movie called "Tusk", Directed by "Silent Bob" @ThatKevinSmith? I'm still deciding if it's a Horror film or a Comedy, was I suppose
My boss tried telling The Purge was the best movie ever. I'm sorry but have you seen Tusk?
Help I'm on a date with a guy who hates The LEGO Movie and loves Tusk. the fuck is happening
The movie tusk is honestly the weirdest thing I've ever seen and now I'm terrified ok bad idea
Tusk is my favorite Johnny Depp movie hands down. @ThatKevinSmith
If you ever watch the movie Tusk, you'll never be able to look at walrus' the same again
#Tusk movie is an absolute gift to #SModCo podcast fans! Thanks, @ThatKevinSmith. Well done, sir.
I think I'm going to be the walrus-man from the movie Tusk for halloween, that'd be so hot. #WalrusYes #MrTusk

I'm watching Tusk and I'm expecting big things from a movie where a guy turns another guy into a walrus
Sometimes I do smart things like learn a new skill or read a book and then other times I do really stupid things like watch the movie "Tusk"
The movie tusk makes me want to learn about walruses
@ThatKevinSmith Tusk is just a f***ing disturbed movie. Just brilliant !!
movie time, rount 2: #TUSK . #WALRUSYES tuskthemovie https://instagram.com/p/0ddqjrt5OQ/ 
#EUCO Tusk tells us about the movie "Mission impossble" ; Juncker admits he doesn't follow
Tusk is now riffing on his own Mission Impossible movie metaphor for British treaty change demands. Bit surreal
Nobody watch the movie tusk because you will have nightmares forever

@katlong31 I was watching a Justin long movie a couple nights ago. Before my roommate sat down she asked "This isn't tusk is it?"
Just saw the trailer for @ThatKevinSmith movie #Tusk & it looks like the walrus version of the human centipede. Curious to watch it now.
Anyone ever watch Tusk? What a fucked up movie, wish I hadn't watched it. D:
If you've seen tusk we need to have a movie analyzation because that was TOO MUCH to handle

of course they fucking played tusk by fleetwood mac in the movie tusk smh
@ThatKevinSmith Just watched Tusk for the first time... And uhhh...yeahhh...what a unique movie experience...
How did Tusk help Kevin Smith finance Clerks III? The movie made 1/3 of it's budget.
Rent Tusk, he said. It looks like a good movie. @coolhand_law #neveragain pic.twitter.com/R8P9Wr3HVl
if u like walrus themed horror movies w Johnny depp cameos then tusk is the movie for u

The Movie Tusk
The movie Tusk may be the weirdest thing I've ever seen. It's such a mind fuck.
After Tusk I'm super skeptical of the next Kevin Smith movie...knowing that the next movie is Clerks 3 scares me more,and now Mallrats 2....

@ThatKevinSmith Just finished viewing #Tusk. A real "sick" movie. Loved it. Brilliant performance by Johnny Depp btw. #walrusyes
watched tusk the movie @ThatKevinSmith every film from now on should have michael parks in! awesome film, slightly sucky ending
@ThatKevinSmith @tuskthemovie If nothing else, Tusk was beautifully shot. I liked the movie, but even more it looks fantastic.
Wow, this movie was absolutely pathetic. Dear Kevin Smith, I want my 1 hour 40 minutes back. Tusk is the worst movie I've ever seen.
Has anyone ever seen the movie tusk ?
@ThatKevinSmith @bonafflick @tuskthemovie Tusk was great. Best movie I've seen in theaters in awhile. Keep up the great work Kev! #WalrusYes
@ThatKevinSmith Tusk was crazy weird but awesome man. Love the movie and love your writing. Keep it going. Can't wait for Clerks III!!!
@ThatKevinSmith tusk was creepy as all fuck balls. But, oddly enough it was a good movie. What the fuck has happened. #WalrusYesStill
@ThatKevinSmith I For One Sir Think Tusk was an awesome horror movie, Johnny Depp performance was hilarious, plus all my friends loved it.
@ThatKevinSmith @bonafflick @tuskthemovie I found Tusk to be horrible...for all the right reasons. Awesome movie!
@raquelsolla this has just disturbed me almost as much as the movie Tusk. And that's kinda hard to do...
Tusk is the creepiest movie ever
@ThatKevinSmith @tengude @tuskthemovie Tusk would have been the perfect movie to just discover while browsing a video store.
All right, time to finally watch that walrus movie @ThatKevinSmith is always talking about. Let the #Tusk insanity begin!
I can't say a movie has EVER altered my perception of the human condition quite like Tusk #WalrusYes
Just finished watching Tusk... was that ending supposed to be romantic? Cause it wasn't. I never hated a movie so much...
the water is wide such a pretty song but why the fuck is it in a movie like tusk
I just heard Gerard singing the water is wide for that movie tusk and I'm so sad
"this movie so weird it makin my nipples hurt" @AsmTsm #Tusk
@ThatKevinSmith Watched Tusk this week. I think your movie touched me in the bad place... #butisecretlylikedit
@ThatKevinSmith I thought Tusk was an awesome movie. I enjoyed the hell out of it. And I say every chance I get #YesTusk2
@ThatKevinSmith i hope you don't take these guys serious! I got my brother to watch Tusk was his first movie by you and he was blown away!
Since I've been m.i.a. From twitter for so long #lol everyone should watch Kevin smiths movie Tusk it's #great #horror #comedy #walrus
The movie #Tusk was great and grotesque, with a structure similar to Hitchcock’s Pyscho. Well done @ThatKevinSmith !
@ThatKevinSmith Those tweets make me want to see Tusk. I thought it wasn't my kind of movie but it sounds like EXACTLY my kind of movie.
So, "Tusk" just might take the cake for the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. More so than "The Human Centipede" in some ways.

@ThatKevinSmith Those that did not like Tusk didn't like it before they watched it. If they even did that. Way underrated movie.
#tusk was for @ThatKevinSmith pod fans. I heard the pod first then watched the movie right after, one of the best experiences I've ever had
@ThatKevinSmith @WeirdPeople27 @tuskthemovie Tusk was a great weird-me-out movie. It served its purpose. Hated the end, though. Sorry.

Tusk is an alright movie. You should watch Tusk.
The world would be a better place if everyone just admitted the fact that 'Tusk' is the best movie in existence @ThatKevinSmith
I'm halfway through the movie Tusk, and if this movie doesn't have the song "I am the Walrus" in it, I will be extremely disappointed.
if you want to watch a really fucked up movie and have nightmares for weeks I suggest you watch Tusk
@Johnem95 Mine was "If you get this upset over someone liking a movie you don't, I'd hate to see how you deal with real problems." #Tusk

Tusk is the all time weirdest movie ever. The creepiest film of all time.

The Other Movie Tusk Was Dumb Serial Killer Turns His Victims into a walrus lol
Wait we were just made aware of a horror movie with justin long the mac guy is kidnapped and turned into pet walrus exists called TUSK
The movie #Tusk looks disgusting. I mean, sewing all that fat onto Justin Long to turn him into Haley Joel Osment is just gross.
I got the perfect movie and music combo on iTunes. @ThatKevinSmith's Tusk and @TarbyRocks Everfree.
Watching a movie > police pursuit. What's wrong with me?...this is one interesting movie. I'm diggin' it so far. #Tusk
@ThatKevinSmith just finished watching Tusk for the 2nd time. Now that is a movie.

@ThatKevinSmith I just watched tusk it was very odd but I liked it a very interesting movie
Just watched a bad horror movie. Now on to a something better a new Kevin Smith film. I hear it's good. Hope it lives up to the hype. #Tusk
So... just so you know, there's a scene in the movie Tusk, where they play the Fleetwood Mac song "Tusk."
@i5raeldaang Hell yeah! Tusk is great! Basically any Kevin Smith movie is. Also VHS as triply and demented, ugh THE BEST.

@KaylaTudryn08 if you think that's bad look at the movie tusk
Bro you wanna watch a weird movie watch Tusk
I'm glad I watched Tusk, because now I know that any future movie with Kevin Smith's name on it will be 100% confirmed as utter garbage.
Watching the movie 'Tusk'... Oh gawd what is this.
@ThatKevinSmith Tusk has scarred me forever. Nightmares for eternity. No movie has ever affected me like this. Can I have Jay&Bob back now?
Tusk was literally the weirdest movie I have ever seen
DONT EVER WATCH THE MOVIE TUSK

Tusk was a fucked up movie. That's my review.
This Tusk movie is pretty strange, really like Depp’s character though.
