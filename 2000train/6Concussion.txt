This concussion movie is dumb af, i would gladly have 10 years taken off my life for all the football ive played. And would do it again.
This "Concussion" movie is gonna put an end to football. I will be very surprised if my children have the opportunity to play youth football
if you're a fan of the NFL, you should refuse to see 'Concussion.' its a movie about whats ruining our game! the players know the risk!
@kingskid1971 I hear he's been cast to play Roger Goodell in the upcoming Concussion movie, quite appropriate I feel
Why would I pay to see the Concussion movie when I can watch a concussion TV show every Sunday for free?
@Davey_Sports @CoachKentera They love him but know he's a buffoon. NFL has no integrity. Hope concussion movie hurts their wallets

Don't watch the movie concussion if you value football they destroying the game by making it.. watch it for will smith an for him alone
I want see this move that will smith play in called concussion any movie he play in be so good
The first time I saw the trailer for that concussion movie I thought it was a joke. When I realized they were serious, I knew it was.
every football player gotta watch that concussion movie
I'm mad they are using the steelers I'm all the high lights for this concussion movie f you Goodell for allowing this
not one to get excited over movie releases but definitely going to see Concussion the day it comes out
Can't wait for the movie Concussion. I'd say in the next 10-15 years we'll get a movie about rampant use of PEDs all these years in the NFL
My favorite thing to say right now is "tell the truth" like will smith in the concussion movie commercial
Idk Why dey making a Concussion movie. Now they gone make even more lame rules for the game

Feel like Steelers self reporting concussions lately is a direct result of the Concussion movie
Concussion Movie should be interesting,I don't think many football fans or players are going to fully accept the realness of concussions.
am i the only one that thinks that movie Concussion looks really boring?
Lol people talking about the concussion movie like people gonna stop watching football after they see it.

#ConcussionMovie Ima go see this movie I'm concussion prone
Man that concussion movie looks awesome
The movie Concussion looks fantastic
Concussion, Star Wars, Hateful Eight, and The Revenant. I'm gonna live at the movie theaters the last two weeks of the year
Boy, that Concussion movie sure looks like something I want to see on Christmas Day.
Q1: The movie Concussion will be released this month. The trailers look intense but will the movie spur on anything vs. the #NFL #sbchat
That concussion movie ain't gonna do anything we know why and how concussions happen
Wow. Concussion movie advertising during Sunday Night Football.
They got balls playing trailers for the concussion movie during games
"Tell the Truth" Will Smith from the movie Concussion voice
*Commentators debate about concussions at the Steelers game* *Following commercial is the Concussion movie that was filmed in Pittsburgh*
Tbh the last thing I wanna do on Christmas is go see the movie Concussion
Concussion look like it's gone be a good movie
Ben's "concussion timeline" followed by an ad for the Concussion movie that deals with CTE and dudes killing themselves. Nice #SNF
Releasing concussion movie on Christmas is great strategy, if you live on Bizarro planet. Who's up for a feel-bad movie?
I'm really tryna see that Concussion movie
Roger Goodell looking at the movie "Concussion" like: pic.twitter.com/iYY6ppQyZ5
I so want to see Concussion. Looks like a really good movie & it's filmed in Pittsburgh. Who doesn't love a movie filmed in Pittsburgh?
Is Rodger going to go see the movie "Concussion"?
Must see the movie #concussion Football movie filmed in Pittsburgh and starring Will Smith!
That concussion movie has the chance to be good...but that accent will kill any chances at it being taken seriously
. @nflcommish do you still have the original director's cut of the Concussion movie or did that get destroyed like the SpyGate tapes?
Luke Wilson, Alec Baldwin and Will Smith with a bad accent. The concussion movie is a build up to a let down.
NBC talks about #roethlisberger concussion and how he's setting a good example and then commercial for movie #ConcussionMovie coincidence?
Talkin bout Big Ben's concussion last week... Then first commercial during break is a preview for the concussion movie... Awkward
Airing the Concussion movie ad during an NFL game... Interesting choice of a TV spot.
I think the #Concussion movie will be great in terms of enlightening people to the story they're telling, but as a movie, it looks so bad.
Concussion is not my usual sort of sports movie but it has Will Smith in it so I'll probably watch it (because I'm a joke).
So the movie concussion is about the 70s steelers giving concussions to the league. Lots of clips of them in it.
FACT: NFL sends men in black suits to your house to turn the channel every time the concussion movie airs so you dont see it.
Is that Concussion movie insinuating the NFL would have a doctor killed for exposing the health risks?
Still baffled NFL logos, the shield and old footage are in the Concussion movie.
5 min discussion about the “toughness” of Ben Roethlisberger & NFL concussions … and then a movie trailer called Concussion right after
Concussion movie commercial. *Drink* -MA
The NFL sold ad time to the Concussion movie?!?!? Did someone slip that in without Rog knowing?
I love that the Concussion movie is spending so much money to advertise during NFL games.
Anyone tryin to see this Concussion movie with me ?
NFL executives during the Concussion movie commercials:
I wanna see that concussion movie. I just wonder how much influence the NFL had on what was cut.
My God Will Smith's accent in this concussion movie
I wonder what the internal discussions at NFL offices are about the Concussion movie. Would like to be a fly on the wall.
I can't think of one movie that I'm less likely to see in the theater than "concussion"
Minutes after NBC shows a graphic of Ben Roethlisberger's brain injuries, there's a commercial for the Concussion movie.
That concussion movie with Will Smith looks pretty good
Surprised they just showed a preview for the Concussion movie during Sunday Night Football.
I think it is funny they advertise the new concussion movie during Sunday Night Football
This concussion movie looks awful + Will Smith awful accent.
Concussion movie look ite
The concussion movie looks amazing. And now I understand why the NFL hates the steelers so much lol
I've been watching football all day, seems odd that I haven't seen one commercial for the #Concussion movie... #NFL #HerrGoodell

Is anyone really paying to watch that concussion movie? You couldn't pay me to watch it
Love will smith as an actor but screw that concussion movie we dont need any more reasons to ruin the game of football.
@Mikey_Garcia_ you could go there when we go watch the concussion movie in theaters
As someone with the desire to tarnish the sanctity of Sunday football, Obama's going to love the movie Concussion

I wanna see that concussion movie
"I hope the concussion movie wins all the Oscars" – heartbroken @NoraPrinciotti
Concussion the movie looks like it's gonna be good...now they need a basketball movie called Ankles, if you know what I mean
Will Smith's Nigerian accent in that concussion movie needs to be arrested.
oh so they'll make a movie about a guy getting a concussion but they reject my pitch for "back to the future but in the future theyre naked"
Looks like they have enough footage for the movie Concussion. http://fb.me/2oNLL7t5U 
"Concussion" looks like a powerful movie. I predict football will lose three or four fans.
Retweeted Concussion Movie ( @ConcussionMovie): The game has never been more dangerous. One man made an impact.... http://fb.me/21R7oUcnP 
Woooaahh the NFL is "hiding" the risk of concussion. The movie sounds like a waste of time and money.
I hope this Concussion movie paves the way for all kinds of sports injury films. Movies about tennis elbow and swimmers ear and jock itch.
This 'Concussion' movie going a little too hard with the Twitter ads during the game.
How the @NFL hooks fans with concussion movie coming out? Exciting Sunday slate of games. How @WWE shakes it up? League of Nations.
I wish @RealSkipBayless was in that concussion movie and played the guy with CTE and got really into his character and got CTE.
What's the movie #Concussion about?.. I forget. #ConcussionMovie
Concussion wins for best movie title ever. I mean, it's right up there with Rocky and Citizen Kane.
Is it me or are the announcers paranoid by this concussion movie? "The NFL really takes these protocols very seriously" We get it.
the movie concussion... I can't wait to see it
Joe Buck told Troy Aikman at least twice that Carolina clinched the division. Troy still thinks they need a win. Concussion movie promo?
@NPCFootball that's why that concussion movie coming out I guess
I feel like I'm the only one who thinks concussion looks like a stupid movie.
Man I bet the NFL HATES airing trailers for that Concussion movie during their games
The NFL cares more about concussions than I care about seeing the movie Concussion.
"My son's review of Concussion Movie: So this guy comes to America and tries to ruin it." ~ Rabbi Stern
want to see the movie Concussion when it comes out
Showing trailer for the movie "Concussion" during Sunday's football games. #ironic
The NFL is so worried about "Concussion" The Movie, it's taken the advertising dollars, and running a commercial during a game.
Honestly the only way the Concussion movie had any way of making money had to have an A list actor at the helm...hence #WillSmith
Do you guys like the movie #Concussion.... @NFL

I wanna see that concussion movie #ConcussionMovie
First there was the movie "Whiplash" and now "Concussion". I'm waiting for them to release "Hernia".
Concussion movie ads airing during NFL games is like Planned Parenthood ads airing during Republican debates.
I hope this movie "Concussion" doesn't pump too many people up about trying to make it a flag sport.
I love seeing games sponsored by the Concussion movie. The NFL don't give a fuck. ISIS could run ads during a game if they paid enough $.
Can't wait to see concussion movie. Public will now learn the truth what NFL really knew. #concussion
hahaha that Concussion movie. I just saw the trailer and I thought it was a zombie movie. Like whoa concussions in the NFL create zombies?!
I cannot wait to watch Will Smith's new movie #Concussion
Can wait to see #willsmith in the how to make a better helmet movie #concussion - not really
So, @ConcussionMovie comes out now, after the @NFL settlement and concussion protocols. Where's the movie about other sports?
The concussion movie is dumb, if you play football and don't accept the risk of getting a concussion then you shouldn't be playing.
Kinda awkward how the Concussion movie advertised during an NFL game.
Luke Wilson as Roger Goodell in that concussion movie has to be the dumbest casting decision I've ever seen
I love Will Smith and I love sports movies, but the Concussion movie looks not very good.
Concussion seems like a damn good movie
This "Concussion" movie commercial while the games on be so shady.
The concussion movie looks so bad
Will Smith is a sellout and I hate Concussion Movie.
Will Smith's accent in this concussion movie is laughable.
Just saw a promo for the Concussion movie during an NFL game. Surprised the NFL couldn't squash that.
If you want people to take the concussion movie seriously, casting Alec Baldwin as a lead was not the best first step.
I thought that concussion movie preview was a joke at first, like there's no way that's a real movie
Pretty sure this new Concussion movie is about a former steelers player
Will Smith's accent is hilarious in that concussion movie trailer. "Tell dey trut!"
Very funny that the movie Concussion is advertising during NFL games.
New concussion movie. I will definitely take time to see this movie especially since it seems the NFL did not... http://fb.me/1Xvu0OKUK 
I can't believe this Concussion movie is actually real every time I see a commercial for it it seems like a satire parody
I kinda love the Concussion movie commercials during the NFL games.
That concussion movie during football games is like the warning on cigarettes
That concussion movie actually looks pretty good.
Concussion is about to be the best movie ever made because will smith is in it.
Concussion movie just more Obama interventionist propaganda
Watching ‘Concussion’ with football coach Tony Severino, who liked the movie http://www.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/sam-mellinger/article48215825.html …
I need to see the movie concussion
Every time I hear Will Smith fake accent "Tell the twooth" for Concussion movie, the more I convince myself I won't be seeing it. #Twooth
Ugh will smith is rocking the bare faced look in Concussion movie. He is def a guy tht is night and day w and w/o facial hair.
maybe if the will smith concussion movie is good enough they'll cancel the nfl and we won't have to watch the bears anymore
I want to see the concussion movie ..I love any movie that's sports related
Okay, we get it NFL. You are trying to put concussion protocol in place. Seems like you're making an argument against "Concussion" movie.
This concussion movie looks stupid in my opinion
the concussion movie looks so good
Will Smith gone fuck the NFL up with this concussion movie lol
If the Concussion movie coming out is bad, Will Smith's fake accent will be the reason why
This Concussion movie is gonna cause some problems for the NFL & WWE. It also might get Agent J a Oscar

The next movies i have to see before any other movies have to be The Concussion Movie and Krampus
Anyone wanna see the new concussion movie with me...

Shout out to the Concussion movie pubbing it hard on football Sunday.
The NFL is gonna have a hissy-fit over Concussion movie ads during games.
I'm still laughing. An advertisement for the movie CONCUSSION during NFL games.
The concussion movie about to put pressure on the league
no lie the new movie concussion looks soo good
Airing this Concussion movie commercial while Football is on can't be a good look for the NFL.

@Patt_Brown Great Family Movie for Christmas! Nothing like teaching kids the importance of Concussion protocol! ;)
It's super ironic that there are commercials during NFL games for a movie that details how the players are dying from concussion brain mush.
Will Smith's accent in that concussion movie is atrocious
I know everyone is excited for Star Wars, and I am too, but the concussion movie starring Will Smith is one I really want to see.

I lowkey cannot take Will Smith's Nigerian accent seriously in this Concussion Movie. Nice try though.
Pretty ballsy for the new concussion movie to buy commercial time during an NFL game.
nfl has to love ads for the concussion movie during their games
These commercials for the Concussion movie during a football game gotta be awkward af
The concussion movie ad just aired. Hartline next play gets a concussion. Let's see if they take him out of the game
This "Concussion" movie is about to blow the great game of football way out of proportion..
This concussion movie looks soooo dumb
That concussion movie looks soooo good
Will smith and his fake African accent in this "concussion" movie I need to hear more before I can decide how I feel
I wanna see the concussion movie when it comes out
I love the NFL too much to go watch the movie Concussion
The Concussion movie looks so good
It's really pretty amazing that the Concussion movie ads are running during NFL games.

The Dolphins/Ravens is such a bummer that I am thinking about going to see the Concussion movie for a pick me up.
Speaking as someone who's had 6 of my own, the concussion movie looks dumb

With the release of the Concussion movie I hope these NFL settlement checks get here quicker cuz I need for my grandad to look out lol
This "concussion" movie looks ridiculous. Will Smith is the dude but common. They must really be running out of ideas for movies.
Will Smith's Nigerian accent in the concussion movie commercial is how you say not very good
Concussion, I believe, is the most important sports movie ever made.
I'd think you'd need to be suffering from one in order to have any desire to see that concussion movie.
I wanna see the concussion movie that comes out on Christmas
What's the deal with this concussion movie? Don't players know their signing up to play a violent sport? They know the risks
I literally had no idea Will Smith's upcoming concussion movie was actually "Will Smith's upcoming 'Concussion' movie"
They couldn’t find someone with an actual accent to do this Concussion movie?
Just from the previews I see Will Smith should win an Oscar for that Concussion movie!
Is Luke Wilson cast as Roger Goodell in the new Concussion movie?? hahaha #mitchapalooza

Can't wait for Concussion to come out! Movie seems outstanding.
Concussion.... #WillSmith must see that movie
The content of the movie Concussion is so real and I can't wait to dedicate my life to researching concussions and TBIs
I think this concussion movie is gonna bring a lot of exposure to a real-life problem.
I heard they had to alter the movie concussion so they wldnt upset the NFL ... Nah put those parts back in!
Will Smith’s “accent” alone is reason enough not to go see that Concussion movie. Ugh.

I don't get whats so revealing about this "Concussion Movie"...I'm pretty sure ppl knew banging heads with 250 lb LB's wasn't healthy.
Although I know Will Smith can deliver in any movie, I don't see why they couldn't find an African actor for this concussion movie.
The person that wrote it is @jmlaskas Jeanne Marie Laskas. As the movie "Concussion" nears release, she deserves recognition for being first
I think that concussion movie would've been more interesting if will smith wasn't playing an African. That accent is BASURA.

Any movie with Will Smith is a good movie, but I really want to see Concussion.
I feel like Concussion the movie is going to make Goodell look like a monster, as if people didn't already have motive to dislike him
the Concussion movie looks good -- Star Wars -- The U is back -- Will Smith back
I'd go see this concussion movie based simply on the amount of Pittsburgh exterior shots in the trailer.
Concussion the movie looks so freaking good
Will Smith best performance EVER might be in the movie Concussion. That level of acting is something most won't understand.

Concussion seems like a good movie to go see.
will smith's new concussion movie looks amazing. old head is doing some big things.
I'm ready to watch the movie "Concussion" and start a mom group on FB boycotting the NFL
But hey the movie Concussion is gonna come out and we're all gonna see it and pretend we're good people by nodding approvingly.
I really cannot wait to see how this Concussion movie makes the NFL and Goodell look.
Just saw the previews for the concussion movie coming out on Christmas, definitely a movie I want to see.
Anyone down to see the movie Concussion on Christmas with me? :)
@DeeWalz_ that's why will smith is going to shut them down after the concussion movie
I can't wait to see that Concussion movie
Well wear lipstick next time so that way well atleast look good for ya! @NFL and im def seeing the concussion movie now!
@AcunaAndrew @ErikFrenz @Cianaf Concussion movie will be icing on the cake.
I wasn't going to go see that Concussion movie but now I am. I'm fighting back #NFL
Between the terrible calls this year in the NFL & the movie Concussion coming out, I don't see Goodell keeping his job much longer. #NEvsDEN
Love the juxtaposition of Collinsworth drooling over a big hit with previews for the concussion movie during commercial breaks.
I'm not sure I have the guts to watch it in the theater, but the movie "Concussion" looks intense and really important...
The concussion movie looks terrible
Reviews are pouring in for 'Concussion' "A hard-hitting film" "This movie will reverberate with audiences" "MIND = BLOWN"
That movie concussion looks like the stupidest football movie EVER!
The concussion movie is gonna cause a stir in sports but I can't wait to watch it
I'm def gonna go see that movie Concussion.
Did anyone else crack up at Will Smith yelling “TELL THE TRUTH” for that Concussion movie ad?
So, are all/most of the proceeds from this “Concussion” movie going to CTE research? If not, it’s just as much of a money grab as the NFL.
That Concussion movie looks like such a mess. They couldn't at least have Luke Wilson dye his hair to look like Roger Goodell?
I'm trying to go watch the movie concussion it seems interesting.
Whoever decided to air the Concussion movie trailer during probably the highest anticipated game of the season is my troll hero. #NEvsDEN
So Luke Wilson is playing Roger Goodell in that Concussion movie? I guess Howdy Doody's agent must have told him to pass on it.
I bet Goodell is so out of touch he never even becomes aware of the existence of the Concussion movie.
I can't believe the NFL let NBC show a commercial for the movie Concussion during the game.
I'm sure the Concussion movie is as truthful as Remember the Titans, Rudy, Social Network, and every other amazing true story in Hollywood.
This new movie"Concussion" coming out on Christmas with Will Smith,Like I said the other day,is Amazing the Amount of Advertising & Talk !!!
I bet the NFL agreed to show the Will Smith Concussion trailers because they make the movie look like total dogshit
In that commercial for the movie Concussion it looked like there was a scene with Justin Strzelczyk going off.
The concussion movie is probably sponsored by the NFL and the final scene will be "LOL actually concussions are good for your health"
Luke Wilson as Roger Goodell in Will Smith's Concussion movie. I mean, if that's not a "Reveal Magnifiquo" I'm not sure what is @DanHanzus
I'm afraid this Concussion movie is going to be too 'Hollywood' to address the issue. Still, love seeing its ads during MNF
That concussion movie looks stupid and I bet you it will be a flop at the box office.
I'm sure the NFL loves that those commercials for the movie Concussion airs during their games.
Wow. Running the concussion movie ad during prime time football. Name checking Goodell. That's some full contact marketing. #NEvsDEN
I'm excited for this concussion movie but the shot of Will Smith going "tell the truth" all impassioned like is silly af
I can't help thinking/regretting that a major opportunity was missed in not having Alan Tudyk play Goodell in that "Concussion" movie.
Still wondering why Will Smith chose to do this "Concussion" movie .... There has to be more to the story. That's why Imma end up seeing it
The concussion movie looks soooo good
Is this concussion movie a real thing, or did the onion branch out into movies?
Personally I would've cast this guy to play the commish in that Concussion movie: pic.twitter.com/EZOIC7nVNi
The movie Concussion is just to scare kids away from playing football. Smh
Is anyone really willing to pay $$ to see this Concussion movie? Meh.
I need a tom Brady mashup with that concussion movie against goodell and I needed it yesterday @stoolpresidente @jerrythornton1
A trailer for the movie concussion which basically shits on the NFL, played during a primetime game
Concussion movie looks stupid. How are you going to make a movie about that?
Concussion may be the most unappealing movie of all time
there's a new movie called concussion. no one told them you aren't supposed to say the c word? #athleteproblems
Holy shit - the upcoming Concussion movie is being advertised on Sunday night football?!?
Great just what the sport of football needs. A movie called Concussion. Greeeaaattttt
A commercial for the Concussion movie during an NFL game. Awkward...
I'm gonna watch this concussion movie...And I'm still gonna hit with my head in football. I ain't no bitch
I like how Luke Wilson is playing the NFL commissioner in this concussion movie no one wants to see
This Concussion movie is a joke, right?
luke wilson couldn't dye his hair to play goodell in the concussion movie?
The fact that *Luke Wilson* plays @nflcommish in Concussion is probably the most telling thing about the coming message of that movie.
Prediction: The "Concussion" movie will be both important and a really, really bad movie.
If the concussion movie was any good it'd be rated R
Luke Wilson is playing Roger Goodell in the concussion movie? Hahahahaha
Pretty bold of NBC to air ads for the concussion movie
Who's gonna see the new movie "concussion" with me?
So is the NFL gonna sit back and take this Concussion movie coming out?
This Concussion movie looks interesting.
Glad the concussion movie trailer is during the SNF game.
Concussion with Will Smith is going to be a great movie
Is Luke Wilson really playing Roger Goodell in that Concussion movie? Weird casting.
Concussion movie trailer during SNF? Big balls.
I really thought that Concussion movie came and went in theaters already
Concussion looks like a Netflix Original movie.
“Concussion” is something I have zero interest in as a Hollywood movie, but would watch in a heartbeat if it was a sports documentary.
I see will smith getting a Oscar for this movie concussion @Cinemark it looks deep.
I know this concussion movie is supposed to be serious, but I laugh every time b/c how I was with mine
This concussion movie is going to make the NFL even softer
The Concussion movie could not have come at a better time...
Ben Roethlisberger concussion. Two weeks in a row the NFL let a concussed QB keep playing. Good timing for Will Smith’s new movie.
I really want to see that movie 'Concussion' with will smith
If that Will Smith movie Concussion is a hit, prepare for the sequel, MCL Sprain.
Will Smith's accent as a Nigerian Doctor in the previews for that Concussion movie sounds pretty bad
@Mbeau21 I wanna see that movie & Concussion as well. Enjoy!
The movie Concussion could have made its point a lot easier by just playing 2 hours of Phil Simms color commentary.
And that Concussion movie with Will Smith.
like this new CONCUSSION movie that will be bashing the NFL. like, we all love the NFL why do you need to bash it?
If the Concussion movie is successful, they're planning a sequel about irritable bowel syndrome. #concussionmovie
NFL Concussion Protocol is they make the player watch Will Smith's new movie Concussion. If they're aware enough to walk out they're fine.
I thought the NFL was a God? How did they let someone make a Concussion movie?
I hope the concussion movie flops
So is this Concussion movie NFL approved?
I can't imagine the NFL is very happy about ads for The Concussion movie all over their marquee games. Not quite protecting the program.
Everybody thank Will Smith for pushing NFL closer to 2-hand-touch football with this new Concussion movie...SMH
Anyone think the movie "concussion" will be anything more than a huge flop? Who goes to that movie?
You know the concussion movie ppl have a high opinion of Goodell when they pick this guy to play him http://youtu.be/kuWE5XAkV2o 
Wait the guy they got to play Roger Goodell in this horrible looking Concussion movie is... Luke Wilson?
Don't care for that Concussion movie. Football isn't for everyone. There are other things you can play; softball, tee ball,hop scotch, tag..
the Concussion movie must make a positive spin for the nfl. If it was negative there is zero chance they wd be advertising. @BarstoolBigCat
Steelers Justin Strzelczyk character makes appearance in "Concussion" movie promo. #RIP
We definitely need to make a Meme out of Will Smith's "Tell the truth!" Line from the Concussion movie haha
At what point does Roger Goodell go all Kim Jong-on, hack Columbia Pictures' emails and threaten war if the "Concussion" movie is released?
All I see in that Concussion movie is someone trying to make money off of the unfortunate health circumstances of thousands of athletes
#Concussion looks like the biggest BS movie since #Nixon. Dumb. #NFL
how are they airing concussion movie trailers during nfl games?
that concussion movie looks boring as hell
I'm glad Luke Wilson plays Roger Goodell in the movie Concussion because I can't take either of them seriously. #concussion #nfl
I hope that Concussion movie has the worst box office results of all time. #haters
I feel like the concussion movie gon be stupid as hell...but I fw Will Smith as an actor so I'll go see it
Lmao the guy playing roger goodell in that concussion movie looks nothing like him #nfl
Concussion movie
I love that the Concussion movie is airing trailers in the middle of a nationally televised Steelers-Seahawks game.
Concussion the movie what the fuck.......
that movie concussion looks mad good
Damn, that Concussion movie looks interesting.
They really couldn't come up with a better name for that movie than Concussion?
I’m honestly surprised this Concussion movie getting so much burn during games and on Sunday Ticket.
The irony that the concussion movie trailer plays during NFL commercials..
Concussion looks like a great movie!
So glad the concussion movie is advertising during football
lol @ Concussion movie trailers dead smack in the middle of a game
The Sony “Concussion” movie is going to portray WWE Medical Director Dr Joseph Maroon as an incompetent willin... http://bit.ly/1HymUYC 
Concussion just looks like a Propaganda movie......I guess they wanna hype up Will Smith for an Oscar Nomination
I believe the NFL has found a TV commercial it wishes it didn't have to accept: for the Christmas-day release of the movie "Concussion."
#telecharger Watch Concussion (2015) Full Movie With HD™ Quality : (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygo... http://bit.ly/1MNY3yT  #gratuit
Who castes Luke Wilson as Roger Goodell as Roger Goodell in the movie Concussion? Roger Goodell?
Concussion is also a horrible name for a movie about concussions. I get A Beautiful Mind was taken, but. . . we couldn't do better?
What type of accent is Will Smith attempting in that concussion movie
I wish we still lived in a world where Will Smith made a rap song for each movie. Concussion would have a sick beat.
@Hyoton1 Luke Wilson: Concussions? What? You’re a concussion. Alec Baldwin: I’m Jack Donaghy in this movie. Will Smith: TELL THE TRUTH.
Check out my recently published law review article before you see the movie "Concussion" opening Christmas Day. https://lnkd.in/eHj5qSy 
Haven't seen a movie in theaters since Transformers but definitely wanna see Creed, Spotlight and Concussion this winter
That concussion movie look weak af
Very very excited to see Will Smith's movie Concussion. Such an interesting and relevant topic in sports today.
and that concussion movie might be the first Will Smith movie I don't watch
Concussion movie? Really? Running out of ideas, Hollywood. If you are scared, drop your millions and fame and go get a desk job.
The ultimate insult to Roger Goodell is that they cast Luke Wilson to portray him in that concussion movie
They should have cast the candidate from the BK chicken nugget debate ad as Roger Goodell for the Concussion movie. Has the look & attitude.
Love seeing ad for Concussion movie heading straight into Redskins preview. Good times.
Dear the movie 'concussion', don't ruin football and make it 2 hand touch. I'll take a slow brain to play NFL football
That NFL concussion movie looks good but I've seen American soldiers sacrifice more and get less pay #Capitalism
Concussion the next movie to see ...
Marketing the concussion movie to the millions of folks waiting to see concussions is pretty funny.
This Concussion movie looks so stupid lol
Fully expect the 'concussion' movie to tank
Whoever did the casting for the Concussion movie should never be allowed to work again
Why is there a Concussion Movie coming out gonna cause an unneeded uproar
Will Smith doesn't make good movies, which is a shame because it'd be nice if Concussion is a good movie.
Really movie called Concussion. Looks terrible. Are we really running out of ideas for movies. And @WillSmithNews cast in it. Come on Will
I see they didn't even try to make a convincing Roger Goodell in the Concussion movie.
That concussion movie looks stupid as fuck
It's beyond bizarre seeing ads for #concussion movie on NFL network.
@PFTCommenter I am trolling anyone who gives the movie Concussion a positive review, with pictures of are troops.
That Concussion movie commercial with Will Smith cracks me up at the end. "TELL THE TRUTH!" - Will Smith
Can't wait to see the concussion movie. It's really going to open people's eyes
That new Will Smith movie "Concussion" is just another one of liberal Hollywood's attempts to pussify American football. {{-_-}}
Oh. Bad look. Hopefully this guy gets a part in the new concussion movie https://twitter.com/seifertespn/status/671003044574715905 …

'Concussion' movie ads to air during NFL games. Goodell is screwed. This is why he needed Deflategate distraction http://bit.ly/1jmdxPX 
Who exactly is the audience for that #Concussion movie?... Because it's not football fans.
Will Smith was a HORRIBLE choice for the Concussion movie. I know there were WAAAAAAAY better choices they could have made for that role!

NBA League Pass games advertising the Concussion movie. Coincidence I bet.
After watching "Creed", which glorifies pushing through head injuries, I'll be interested to see Will Smith's "Concussion" movie.
Wait...Mitch from "Old School" (Luke Wilson) is Roger Goodell in this new concussion movie???? Lolololololol #believable
@WfanMongo109 Had some free time. His work on the Concussion movie is over.
that concussion movie looks nice but i couldnt stand watching will smith sound like a nigerian straight out of lagos
I heard that the main character from the movie "Concussion" grew up to be Florida's head coach
I have lost all respect for Will Smith for doing that stupid concussion movie
I'm sorry but Will Smith's accent is too funny from the previews of his new movie, "concussion"
Will Smith should delete that concussion movie. Saddest acting try ever.
What kind of idiots will spend money on that Concussion movie thats coming out soon
Wanna see the Will Smith concussion movie just to hear him say "tell the truth"

@jvscoundrel @moderncomments @ChrisWarcraft The movie Concussion seems very timely.
That NFL concussion movie could be good, but Will Smith is in it so it's probably not.
After my mom sees this Concussion movie she's never gonna let me play football again
I assume you're assigned homework if you go see that Will Smith concussion movie.
Roger goodell will probably hire a hitman to kill Will Smith after the movie "Concussion" comes out, or fine him a billion $'s
I bet you can lose track of time watching the concussion movie
Oh. My. God. I am so excited to see the movie Concussion I can't believe they are making a movie about this
I bet the concussion movie is a drool fest
You just KNOW that Goodell and the NFL are putting huge pressure on the Concussion Movie producers not to FUCK THEM OVER TOO BADLY! #NFLHell
I think that new concussion movie looks pretty dumb
I'm sure the NFL is thrilled about that Concussion movie coming out on Christmas
Concussion will be a good movie but it will hurt the game of football so much.
Deff wanna see the movie Concussion..
the concussion movie is so stupid. if you want the real story watch the documentary with the real doctor who discovered it
This movie Concussion looks like its goin be good..
The concussion movie will be the beginning of the end to football.
Concussion looks like an amazing movie
Just saw the Will Smith concussion movie trailer...oof, that accent . Also saw Chi-raw trailer today and that looks
Am I the only person that thinks the concussion movie seems really stupid and pointless?
I think every AT student out there will be seeing the Concussion movie.
Will smith's talent was wasted on that Concussion movie. I just can't get past that accent. Horrendous!!! Chai!!!!

I hope the movie "Concussion" flops at the box office.
Who's gonna go watch the concussion movie?! The commercials get me so excited that it's gonna be a good educational and eye-opening movie!
I think ima go see dat Concussion movie just cuz Will Smith kill all his roles Lol
This is what Will Smith is fighting to gain awareness for in the upcoming concussion movie https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/670713167450783744 …
Family Log. Roller skating done. Concussion. Broken ankle. Broken shoulder. Broken arm. (injuries exaggerated mildly). Now, Peanuts movie.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/o3EsG-ktBlQ?a  Concussion Official International Trailer #1 (2015) - Will Smith Drama Movie HD
OK that Concussion movie def looks good and I think Will Smith will be good but they coulda used a different actor imo
The NFL has to be involved in the casting choice of fat Luke Wilson as roger goodell in the will smith concussion movie?
It's sad that the Concussion movie will prevent so many kids from getting to play the sport that I love
Who wants to go see the concussion movie with me and just talk really loud in Will Smith's characters accent the entire movie?
@24HourPolls There's a movie called concussion?
Can't wait for this very serious Concussion movie starring very serious actors Will Smith, Luke Wilson, Alec Baldwin & Paul Reiser.
This Concussion movie looks like the lamest movie ever.
Do you think Concussion looks like it will be a good movie?
Ion know bout yall but i aint excited bout dat "Concussion" movie..
Concussion looks like Will Smith’s funniest movie since Mohammed Ali (peace be upon him)
I'm surprised ESPN is showing the ads for the Concussion movie.
I hope that concussion movie tanks. Such a STUPID idea for a movie
How are they allowed to make that movie "Concussion" without getting sued by the NFL lol you know it's probably against what NFL does
The concussion movie looks stupid as fuck. You guys realize concussions are a natural part of football when colliding into each other
Concussion looks like a sick movie
Is anyone actually excited about the Concussion movie?
I've seen the trailer for the Concussion Movie this week more than I have any DraftKings commercial
I bet coach Williams is so happy about the concussion movie coming out
What is Will Smith's accent in this concussion movie?
Do these "Concussion" movie ads make a lot of college football viewers get up to get a beer?
The NFL is going to be real hurt by this new concussion movie
..........I'll bet the @NFL just can't wait for this " Concussion" movie to come out....
I cannot express how excited I am for Will Smith's new Concussion movie. It's about time people learned the truth.
I definitely want to see that Concussion movie with Will Smith. But after the Super Bowl so I'm not consciously caring about head injuries
This #concussion movie may be the dumbest thing I've ever seen. If your concerned of the dangers of football simply DON'T PLAY!
I would prefer #DarftKings commercials to another ad for this stupid Concussion movie.
WAIT A MINUTE. Luke Wilson is playing Roger Goodell in the concussion movie with Will Smith? OKAAAAAAYYY...
The concussion movie looks absolutely terrible
I hope Roger Goodell is just as big of a fuck stick in the movie concussion as he is in real life
there's a new movie out called concussion & im real surprised @dacord423 & I aren't the stars in it
I can't take Will Smith seriously as long as he's doing that accent for the Concussion movie.
Everytime I see commercials for the Concussion movie I think it's fake
The new concussion movie is going to ruin football
Concussion the Movie... Because nothing says Merry Christmas like brain injuries
Yea, won't be going and watching that concussion movie.
The concussion movie is gonna flop hard as fuck
I want to see the Concussion Movie, but I don't because I don't need to hear that kinda stuff when Pat plays football
Concussion movie...really
I really have no desire to see that concussion movie. Wouldn't be surprised if it was a complete flop.
I'm sure the NFL is going to love that Concussion movie.
Concussion movie is so soft obviously playing football you know the risk of getting a concussion
That "Concussion" movie looks so stupid
That concussion movie looks like it's going to be Will Smith's worst movie ever.
I can't wait to see Concussion movie.
I want to see this Concussion movie like WHOA.
This concussion movie looks really good
Just saw a commercial for the movie Concussion during a football game and that perfectly describes America as a country.
The new movie "Concussion" staring Will Smith looks great. The NFL is going to get exposed.
I feel uncomfortable watching football with these damn concussion movie commercials #GoBlue
The "Concussion" movie looks good, but Luke Wilson playing Roger Goodell is weak. There was only one REAL choice. pic.twitter.com/zIXdW8nVjZ
What is the target demographic for the movie Concussion? Sports medicine doctors? No one is going to see that movie. No one.
RT @DearLeader10 Allegedly Igbo RT @Sauniell: What accent is Will Smith supposed to have in this concussion movie? pic.twitter.com/tgaAW4adfb
NFL was like, "Sure, put that concussion movie out. People will be too busy laughing at the casting choices to actually watch it."
Luke wilson as Goodell RT @bomani_jones: lol…this concussion movie didn’t even try to get ppl who looked like the folks they’re playing.
Concussion movie is bullshit....you sign up to play football you know the risks. Bottom line.
I low key wanna see that NFL concussion movie haha
This concussion movie pisses me off. You'll get hit in the head when you play football. Also, personal responsibility. You hurt? Don't play.
This concussion movie looks so bad
The concussion issue is very real and this movie, which supposedly looks at the issue, has already been ripped apart and edited by the NFL.
Concussion: The movie the NFL DOESN'T want you to see. Because you'll watch, go "Hey, that's bad" & continue watching football every weekend
Just saw a trailer for Concussion the movie... My opinion on that issue, at this point you know the risk of playing football, no need to sue
This concussion movie that's coming out is going to ruin the NFL...
I hope some one gives Roger Goodell tickets to that movie Concussion
The movie Concussion is gonna ruin football. You know the risks when you strap up, don't like it don't play motherfucker #stupidmovie
Honestly: is anyone looking forward to #Concussion? It's a 2 hour, Oscar bait "message movie" telling us a message we already know.
Concussion seems like a movie you had to watch on a field trip to the IMAX.
Shocked that ABC sold ad space to Will Smith's Concussion movie on what is arguably one of the biggest College Football games of the season.
Allegedly Igbo RT @Sauniell: What accent is Will Smith supposed to have in this concussion movie?
" @bomani_jones: lol…this concussion movie didn’t even try to get ppl who looked like the folks they’re playing." Thinking tha same thing!
I just don't see how concussion will be a good movie
The movie Concussion swears like they're gonna make people stop watching the NFL lol
Concussion looks like a really good movie
Concussion movie looks interesting. @nflcommish you excited?
why do they try to make the concussion movie look hype lmao it's a movie about concussions
This "Concussion Movie" looks . Will Smith need to start back doing comedy movies he's drifting away from what made him famous.
Omg concussion the movie is just another ploy for the NFL to make money they signed off on it just for money
Will Smith and football. I'm all about this Concussion movie!
That concussion movie just gone bring more rule changes to football and make it almost similar to Flag football
Wow we are making a concussion movie now? Good lord what is the entertainment industry coming to?
Who the hell wants to watch a concussion movie on Christmas day? Lol
PLEASE tell me that concussion movie is a joke....
Who in their right mind is going to see the concussion movie?
The worst way the concussion movie portrays Roger Goodell is by having Luke Wilson play him
This Concussion movies looks way overhyped. They tried to make it look like a James Bond movie or something in the commercials
The concussion movie looks so good man
I wanna see the concussion movie
I'm trying to see this concussion movie
Concussion looks like a good movie
lol…this concussion movie didn’t even try to get ppl who looked like the folks they’re playing.
Really excited for the Concussion Movie
Liberals make a movie with Alec Baldwin attacking the NFL and football, then advertise it...during football games. No thanks "Concussion"
I wanna see that Concussion movie but I know i'ma be the only one in there laughing when Will Smith says "TELL THE TRUTH!" w/ that accent
Hmmm that Concussion movie with Will Smith looks good.
This concussion movie is going to be terrible for the game of football.
Would anyone like to see the concussion movie with me when it comes out?
Concussion movie is funny. Nobody is making pple play football. It's a person choice. Don't try and take away the choice of football just(1)
I can't wait until Concussion comes out, Will Smith is going to do his thang in that movie
Concussion movie- BIG EXPOSURE ON NFL! http://usat.ly/1QLQvAo  @SportTechie #USATODAYSPORTS pic.twitter.com/qVrZ1nR0Sa

"CONCUSSION" ★★★★★★★★★★★★ -Variety "Knockout movie of the year!" -Hollywood Reporter "Dazzling" -LA Times Promoted
Everytime I see this Concussion movie trailer --- I'm upset at Will Smith's accent. Like.... pic.twitter.com/ULQDMrnLph
Will smith trying to fake an African accent in the movie concussion is too funny
Yes, that's Luke Wilson playing Roger Goodell in the movie Concussion. The one from Old School and Idiocracy. #WorstCastingEver
I need to see the movie Concussion
I've got a feeling that more money is being spent on advertising the concussion movie than it's gonna make....
I'm sorry but the concussion movie looks really stupid. It's a real issue affecting real people but it almost seems to poke fun at the issue
Creed, The Big Short, Concussion... movie industry is gonna try to drain me in December
CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE CONCUSSION. That movie looks so good, & after all the David Ash concussions, I'm glad it's talked about more now.
That Concussion movie looks
Absolutely 0 intention to watch that Concussion movie
I have two must see movies creed and the concussion movie
That concussion movie looks stupid
Neuro-Laser Foundation reports from the red carpet about the #untoldstory of "Concussion" movie. http://ow.ly/VbvOh 
That moment when you can relate to a Will Smith movie poster though... Lol #willsmith #concussion… https://instagram.com/p/-nGrT-OCib/ 
The NFL is so gangsta they are letting the trailer for "Concussion" movie run before the game. Even fresh prince does not intimidate them!
Just make take, but if you don't wanna get concussed. I would avoid contact sports. That concussion movie is a damn joke.
To be fair to "Concussion", they already made a really interesting movie on the topic. It's called "League of Denial"
Not interested in seeing the Concussion movie. It's a movie that shines a negative light on something that I have a healthy passion about.
Man you watch that Concussion movie preview and they got you thinking it's the sequel to I Am Legend
been saying for years they gonna try to replace football w soccer as the number one sport in the US. this concussion movie is another step
So is the trailer of that Will Smith movie supposed to be insinuating that the NFL tries to murder scientists who do concussion research?
Officially hating will smith for this concussion movie. It's making football out to be the worst sport ever
I don't know if I'd watch that concussion movie if someone payed me to go see it
Luke Wilson is playing Roger Goodell in that Concussion movie? That's weird.
The dude from East bound and down is in Concussion, I can't take this movie seriously
I wonder if Concussion Movie is going to tell everyone that football is a voluntary sport.
Lol I will absolutely not be seeing that concussion movie
I doubt football players go see that concussion movie.. That's a horror movie to us
That Concussion movie is going to bring BIG heat on the NFL
This Concussion movie gonna hurt some feelings
how many lawsuits are pending by the NFL against this concussion movie?
I need to see that Concussion movie
Concussion is such a terrible looking movie I may watch Draft Day in protest.
Jumping to this "Concussion" movie for a second: Luke Wilson as Roger Goodell is the worst casting ever. Unless he plays him as "The Baumer"
Real-Life Preview of Concussion Movie via @forbes http://onforb.es/1lg4O2N 
The previews for the movie concussion piss me off... You're getting paid millions of dollars to bash your heads together. You know the risks
Someone just asked about the movie concussion but pronounced it like con-coo -zen and thought will smith played a superhero. Help me.
They deadass running out of ideas for movies lmao cause I just saw a commercial for a movie called "Concussion" staring Will Smith
All of these late hits on football players make more excited to see the movie Concussion
@AJ_Klenc I highly suggest watching that new Will Smith concussion movie
Halftime would be a great time for commercials about that concussion movie that Will Smith is trying to save his career with
This "Concussion" movie may ruin the NFL.
Man concussion, and the new Jesse Owens movie I gotta watch
I'm sure after we see the movie Concussion, my son's football playing days will be over. I'm cool with it.
Concussion looks like it's going to be a great movie. You can't go wrong with Will Smith as an actor & the topic is important. :-) #football
The movie concussion is going to be so good
@mariachong there is a new movie coming about called "Concussion". I'm excited for people to learn from it!

I can't wait to see Concussion that looks like a really good movie too!
Whoever goes to watch that will smith concussion movie is a communist
'Concussion' Movie Will Be Heartbreaking, Enlightening, Disturbing http://fb.me/YmuY1czm 
Will Smith's accent in the concussion movie sounds so bad
Wasn't sure who was going to see that Concussion movie but I bet the lady telling me football should be banned already has her tickets
So, this Concussion movie looks interesting. Looks like the villain will be a certain professional football league.
There is a movie called Concussion coming out. Interesting.
Oh man... the "Concussion" movie looks good....
Saw the Concussion movie preview. Concussions are not just in the NFL.
Every time I see a trailer for the Concussion movie, I want to throw up.
I hope the Concussion movie is an absolute flop at the box office. The people who made that movie are exploiting players as much as the NFL.
Christmas Day. Concussion movie. It's happening.
Bart Starr is also starring in the movie Concussion with Will Smith.
I can't take the movie "Concussion" seriously. XD
I have to go to the movies soon! I wanna see Creed and The Concussion Movie
That "Concussion" movie will rustle so many jimmies.
Cost for a 30 second Super Bowl ad: $4.5 million Cost for Concussion movie Super Bowl ad: not enough money in the world.

Will smith movie "concussion" will be the best movie of 2015 and that's facts.
I want to go see Will Smith's new movie "Concussion."
Kinda hyped for that Concussion movie
I want to go see the movie Concussion solely for the purpose to say it was bad and follow it up with "That movie gave me a headache".
No one has ever wanted anything as much as Will Smith wants an Oscar with that concussion movie. #TellTheTruth
Concussion: Important topic, can't IMAGINE it's worth sitting thru an entire movie for tho. Maybe when it's on HBO or something...
Wondering why I was not asked to star in the Concussion Movie
Let's make a movie knowing everyone will call it "that concussion movie."
That Concussion movie finna be trash
@billbarnwell @Aterangelus "compared to this live turducken, the players have it pretty easy" -Goodell's response to the movie Concussion
Bet the NFL loved that ad for the Concussion movie during the Panthers/Cowboys game.
Not watching that concussion movie will smiths last good movie was I am legend can't go ruining him for myself

@SportsSturm The Kuechly hit on Cassel? Apparently, he's a runner so he can be, uh, lit up? (Cue "Concussion" movie promo.)
'Concussion' ads turn up on NFL's Thanksgiving Day games: It was the first time the movie's ads have run during NFL… http://dlvr.it/Crlwkd 
The NFL is becoming a joke! And after the concussion movie the NFL will have to change to the PFL or TFL
As this game progresses, I think more and more that Simms should be featured in this concussion movie #heslostit
Ads for the NFL-critical movie ‘Concussion’ were aired during the NFL’s Thanksgiving Day games http://wapo.st/1Idno6p 
Concussion looks like such a good movie
That concussion movie looks stupid and so over dramatic
Yo is will Smith supposed to be African in this concussion movie? His accent horrible
I honestly can't wait to see the movie Concussion
Weird this concussion movie is being advertised during the games
I love that @espn and @CBSSports are running commercials promoting the movie Concussion. Haven't seen if @NFLonFOX or @NBCSports have yet.
The Concussion movie gonna have a twist ending like new jack city where goddell gets off free and gets shot by harvin marrison at the end.
So how does the NFL feel about the concussion movie being advertised during Thanksgiving football?
Wonder if #NFL likes the Concussion movie trailer being played during a major broadcast?
I’m with the Concussion movie. I just know already I won’t be able to take Will Smith doing whatever accent he’s doing.
How Roger Goodell looked watching the concussion movie commercial aired during a thanksgiving football game pic.twitter.com/B6LVi6ckXb
I'd think I'd rather sit through both Magic Mike movies than watch the new "Concussion" movie.
The movie concussion looks really good
I was 0 percent interested in seeing The Concussion movie but then I saw Luke Wilson was playing Goodell. pic.twitter.com/dEdvwp5Wbl
Wow they made a movie called concussion aka I should star in that movie
The guy they cast as Goodell in the new Concussion movie doesn't look the part at all, way too put together and didn't look stupid
The irony of all these Concussion Movie commercials during Thanksgiving Football
"That NFL concussion movie makes me sick, those Hollywood people will do anything for a buck" #thanksgivinghottakes
Wait, so that concussion movie is a real thing? Looks about as bad as it sounds.
NFL getting paid off the movie i think RT @illiam_william The jig RT @fivefifths: Wait they're playing Concussion trailers during NFL games?
Wait, Luke Wilson is playing Roger Goodell in the "Concussion" movie? What?
Why would anyone go see the Concussion movie? Looks like a Lifetime drama.
Concussion movie commercial in the middle of the game... Shots fired NFL. Shots fucking fired
Luke Wilson plays Roger Goodell in the Concussion movie? Might as well have cast Will Smith for that part too. Ridiculous casting.
CBS playing the concussion movie trailer during a NFL game ....bold move CBS
Luke Wilson playing the commish in that Concussion movie? surely they could have found someone who looks more like an arrogant d-bag
It's hysterical that the Concussion movie commercials are airing during every commercial break for the NFL games today. @nflcommish
That Concussion movie looks sick... Will Smith really is one of the best actors of our time
They just showed that Concussion movie trailer during a football game. SAVAGE.
I keep seeing this preview for the concussion movie. Just a heads up. It's football. I don't care. I love football. It's physical.
I'm guessing the NFL can't be thrilled about that Concussion Movie trailer being advertised during their Thanksgiving Cowboys' game.
"what's that movie? concussion? what's that about?"
Instead of watching that Concussion movie, I plan on watching the NFL. #SorryWill
Lol at the fact that Roger Goodell is played by Luke Wilson in this new concussion movie about the nfl
I don't wanna see the movie Concussion until I'm done playing football cause I don't wanna be out there playing scared
That's pretty bold advertising the Concussion movie during this game....
Concussion movie ad at the first commercial break? That is awesome. And I wonder how much it cost
While everyone is thinking about that bad pass, I'm thinking about how good that Concussion movie looks
How much do you think that Concussion movie had to pay to put their commercial in the middle of the Thanksgiving NFL games #Millions
You gotta be real anti nfl to make that stupid Concussion movie
Advertising the concussion movie right in the middle of Thanksgiving football. A+ trolling.
I couldn't be any less interested in this Concussion movie and I'm a football fan...not sure who a film like that appeals too. Flop for sure
Hilarious that they are showing ads for this concussion movie during the football games
These Concussion movie promos during the game are awesome trolling of the NFL
This upcoming movie, "concussion" looks like the dumbest movie idea I think I've ever heard of. Worse than human centipede
Will Smith looks just like the President in that concussion movie
No way the NFL likes this Concussion Movie trailer commercial running during their Thanksgiving game.
Lord God Will Smith is a genius. Concussion movie commercials during NFL games on Thanksgiving. Roger Goodell SICK.
... yo... The NFL is all good with this Concussion movie though?
You know the thing that makes me laugh about the whole "Concussion" movie? People act like its some conspiracy. I mean did we really need a
That concussion movie is pointless everyone knows concussions happen in the NFL lol tf
The Concussion Movie is gonna be real as hell.
I can't believe Concussion is a real movie.
the movie called concussion looks so so so good
I really want to watch the Concussion movie.
Concussion gonna be a good movie
The concussion movie is just going to worry parents, but won't have any effect on people who love to play the game of football
Whoa, an ad for the Concussion movie during an NFL game?!?
I'm a see concussion. Just not gonna watch that depressing movie on Christmas tho.
Concussion is going to be a fantastic movie
I may have to watch that Concussion movie.
Concussion movie looks like a straight to DVD movie
they got Mitch from Old School playing Roger Goodell in this 'Concussion' movie looooool
Interesting to see commercials for Concussion movie during nfl games
lol at the Concussion movie advertising during NFL games. The NFL would probably take ISIS’s money if they wanted to.
The concussion movie did it again those absolute madmen
Concussion movie buying ad-space during Thanksgiving NFL game. Smart move.
Nothing like airing a concussion movie trailer during a football game
Concussion movie and chill @nnaybe
lol if there was ever a most oscarbait movie its concussion
That concussion movie looks good, it's a good thing I dont have any lingering effects from my concussions
My Friend Peeped Will Smith In The Concussion Movie He Kills It Oscar Nomination Like That!!!!
can't think of a worse movie to make that this #Concussion movie coming out...
I feel like this concussion movie is a cash grab and most likely might be insulting to the real people going through the real issues
That concussion movie looks really good!!!
Kinda wanna see the Concussion movie the day it comes out, kinda want to wait until I stop playing football to see it
Maybe @NFL left #CKeenum in last week to help advertise @Sony movie #Concussion @czabe @WesFoxSports910 http://sportsrevelation.com/nfl-lack-of-action-case-keenum-concussion/ …
I'm really excited to see the Concussion movie but when it comes down to it, it's not going to affect me when bit when i watch the sport
That concussion movie looks good, its a good thing I don't have any lingering effects from my concussions
"You know a good way to get in the Holiday spirits kids? To make you really sad by taking you to this concussion movie. Merry Christmas!"
Will Smith's new movie Concussion gone cause some major problems for the @NFL . http://youtu.be/Io6hPdC41RM 
This Concussion movie is literally making me consider moving out of America. The pussyfication of the United States is here people
" @TheFakeESPN: Everytime they air the trailer for the new Concussion movie Roger Goodell fines James Harrison $50k." Hilarious :o
That concussion movie about to be raw.
MLB has to capitalize off this Concussion movie. An all out campaign to boost African American participation.
That 'Concussion' movie with Will Smith gon open up the floodgates
This concussion movie looks so fucking stupid
Thankful for the commercials for the new movie concussion since the NFL insists on Lions and Cowboys being on yearly.
That Concussion movie is lowkey dumb and I hope it flops
Think, the NFL will have something to say about fox promoting the concussion movie going to eagles Detroit game
TRAILERS 1. Concussion (relevent sports historic drama) 2. Ride Along 2 with Ice Cube + Kevin Hart 3. Some spy movie with Hart and The Rock-
Will Smith's movie is called Concussion. Ironically, that's what people thought he was suffering from when he did After Earth with his son.
That new concussion movie is like, "Do You Hate Roger Goodell? Well You Will After Watching This.."
"Concussion" looks like a good movie. Feel like to really capture head cases Gary Busey should've played Roger Goodell.
The trailer for Will Smith's new movie "Concussion" look intense. Interested in seeing his performance.
#NFL love #Concussion the movie ...can't wait for the sequel #GroinPull ..this time it's personal
That concussion movie looks like trash
Will be shocked if concussion movie is a hit. Serious issue, but people want to be entertained when they buy movie ticket. This = downer.
Seeing the Concussion movie trailer while watching football makes me super uncomfortable/guilty. Thanks #Hollywood
I'm not buying Richie Tenebaum as Roger Goodell (aka the antichrist) in this Concussion movie. Poor casting.
Luke Wilson plays Roger Goodell in the Concussion movie?????
Totally understand and support what the movie "Concussion" is about, but why release it on Xmas? Nobody on such a happy day should go!
I have a feeling the NFL is not too thrilled about that concussion movie coming out. It is basically based on the league of denial
That concussion movie looks like a bundle of butt the more trailers that come out for it
Am I the only one surprised that this Concussion movie not only has access to the NFL brand but gets a prime time NFL ad spot?!
I chuckle when I see ads for the Concussion movie during games because I picture the commish sweating and loosening his collar
Everytime they air the trailer for the new Concussion movie Roger Goodell fines James Harrison $50k.
Wow! Commercials for the movie Concussion airing during the Detroit & Philly game. A massive F you.
They made a movie about NFL concussions. If you are scared of getting a concussion don't play football. That simple. No one is forcing you.
That stupid #concussion movie is going to ruin football even worse!!! U think athletes play sports & don't know u can get hurt! #gtfoh
BREAKING: NFL doctors will not clear Rams QB Case Keenum to watch "Concussion" movie....
Concussion the movie, looks like what the government is doing (WAR wise) just in football terms. Just like soldiers and their PTSD
That was the first time I've seen the trailer for the Concussion Movie....should be interesting
That concussion movie says in their trailer the NFL "doesn't want you to know" yet it's the first commercial during an NFL game???
If the @NFL logo is used in the Concussion movie, that means league gave permission (i.e. got paid) because of player brain trauma. Again.
That concussion movie looks good, it's a good thing I don't have any lingering affects from my concussions
Concussion movie go be so controversial lol. Its always people who never played at any level to have the biggest opinion
I'd probably go see that concussion movie if Will Smith would talk normal.
Whoa, Fox just showed a commercial for the movie "Concussion" during the Eagles/Lions game. Surprised NFL didn't veto that. #fb
The new movie "Concussion" looks awful tbh
Lol Luke Wilson plays Roger Goodell in that concussion movie
An ad for the concussion movie during the Lions-Eagles game? I guess the #NFL doesn't control everything. Yet.
I'd like to think that concussion movie will change some people's opinion on football and the NFL as an organization but it won't
Can't wait to see this concussion movie just to spite @nflcommish I'm sure it'll be awful but anything to help the cause #FireGoodell
Luke Wilson is playing goodell in this concussion movie? Actually lets give him a shot at actually being commissioner
Pretty savage move advertising that Concussion Movie during the Thanksgiving game.
The concussion movie advertised during an NFL game?
Wait they're actually making the concussion movie? Hoo boy
That Concussion movie makes me feel guilty about watching the NFL, then I realize Will Smith is a scientologist then I don't care
As an AT student I'll tell you the ending to the concussion movie: playing football can give you concussions and concussions are bad.
I bet the NFL is furious that they show ads for the Concussion movie during their games
That movie coming out on Christmas #Concussion looks really really good and very interesting. Must see
They are advertising the Concussion movie during an NFL game. I expect there will be a phone call from the NFL to Fox.
The movie “Concussion” looks like a football version of JFK
The concussion movie looks
Ahahaha they're calling the movie about concussions in the NFL 'Concussion' #ConcussionMovie
The Concussion movie is gonna troll the shit outta the NFL.
That concussion movie looks so dumb I think the nfl released it to discredit the cte folks #TellTheTruth
they shoulda asked me to play the doctor in that concussion movie instead of Will Smith, I woulda done a way better Nigerian accent
I wonder if the new #Concussion movie will point out there are more head injuries suffered in youth soccer than in football . . .
Anyone else find it ironic that commercials for the concussion movie are shown during football games nd tht it comes out right b4 playoffs?
Commercial for the Concussion movie during an NFL game. Surprised Goodell didn't censor it.
And the movie Concussion is probably an athletic trainers dream to go see. Looks too good.
"hey guys wanna go see the concussion movie" see it doesnt even sound like a good idea
Will Smith my guy and all but I'm 100% against this concussion movie
Can't believe the NFL allowed this Concussion movie to happen
Lmbooo luke Wilson playing roger goodell? This concussion movie need to go to straight to DVD
Concussion movie commercial right smack dab in the middle of an NFL game
They're making a movie called Concussion and I'm not in it, this is ridiculous
Will Smith concussion movie looks OK. @patricklink's Headstrong is a great play w/ similar themes. Great @ESTnyc production a few years back
Are they really coming out with "The Concussion Movie"?
Concussion is going to be a terrible movie. Hot take: Will Smith is not a good actor
Awesome to see a trailer for the CONCUSSION movie play in a NFL commercial break
Is Concussion an actual movie or a try-to-be movie pushing activism trotted out to get socially conscious dollars?
An ad for the Concussion movie during the #PHIvsDET game. Love the balls you're showing, @NFLonFOX
They trynna ban football with this concussion movie or what?
I am sure NFL is thrilled fox is advertising this concussion movie during the broadcast of an NFL game
Lowkey that concussion movie look good
How can I take this concussion movie seriously if Luke Wilson is playing Goodell?
that Will Smith " #Concussion" movie look good... I'm watchin it.
Lost a lot of interest in the "Concussion" movie when I found out they monitored content based on the NFLs interest
That concussion movie looks so gay. I hope the guy who made that gets a concussion
Also how about Concussion Movie advertising during NFL games. Thats a mouse trap
I can't wait to see the movie #Creed and #Concussion. Maybe I'll have someone to go see them with?
That Concussion movie looks good
That concussion movie is going to make as much money as a lemonade stand in the Hood.
Concussion the movie, really? Fuck you
Today's game on fox is brought to you by the movie Concussion starring Will Smith
There's a concussion movie coming out on Christmas Day. Watch the NFL react. Lmao
*during nfl commercial break* WATCH THE MOVIE THE NFL DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SEE (but comfortable taking advertising money from) CONCUSSION
'Concussion' looks like such a great movie except for the hilarious part where Will Smith points and yells 'tell the truth!'
That Concussion movie is gonna suck. So do the Eagles.
I can absolutely not believe the NFL let the "Concussion" movie ad on one of their nationally televised games…
This Nfl concussion movie might be the dumbest shit to hit the screens in a long time
Will Smith is the man but you already know that. Definitely watching the concussion movie.
Lmao Owen Wilson is playing Roger Goodell in the movie "Concussion"
They ran a promo for the Concussion movie during Thanksgiving football, greatest Thanksgiving ever
This "Concussion" movie might be the final signifier for the end of mankind
That concussion movie looks so bad. These people play football. They run into each other on purpose. What do you expect to happen?
That Concussion movie looks good but it's gonna be hard to take Will Smith's Nigerian accent seriously.
Lol the concussion movie has trailers running during football. Eat it NFL
This Concussion movie looks good, but according to the Sony leak, the NFL lawyers already had most of the teeth taken out of it.
Inwanna see that concussion movie
so how much does Goodell and the NFL hate that this concussion movie is coming out?
So the NFL are such whores that they air the Concussion movie commercial that is against them?
Definitely watching this Concussion movie.. #WillSmith #ConcussionMovie
This Concussion movie is gonna fuck the NFL
Will smith must have got himself a concussion before agreeing to star in a movie called concussion
Lmaoooo at them running concussion movie previews during the thanksgiving games
Concussion movie gonna turn the NFL into a flag football league
Can’t do anything to make that Concussion movie look appealing man. Gonna be one of Smith’s biggest box office failures
Playing the Concussion movie trailer during Thanksgiving football is my favorite form of trolling.
If there isn't a sweet montage of huge hits in the concussion movie I'll be very disappointed
Concussion looks like such a good movie
The dude from old school is @nflcommish in the movie concussion? I love a good comedy!
Concussion Movie is gonna be dope. I'm thankful for Will Smith

The new concussion movie makes the NFL look so bad

So Frank Gifford reportedly had brain disease? That just furthers purports of the upcoming Concussion movie.
Concussion is going to be the best movie of the year.
Will Smith is my favorite actor. But in this new Concussion movie he got coming out. His African ascent is horrible.
With Frank Giffords autopsy finding out that he had CTE and the "Concussion" movie coming out in exactly a month, NFL is in trouble.
There's a movie coming out on Christmas with Will Smith called Concussion. I bet I'm gonna have to go see that lol.
@Dpaul09 yea I liked that one gets dark quick lol but Creed man that's like movie I've been waitin for other than concussion and Star Wars
Concussion - Official Movie Site | Sony Pictures http://bit.ly/1Tdv9u0  #ForThePlayers
Horrible accent aside, "Concussion," the new Will Smith movie about the public release of the NFL concussion lawsuit looks good.
The movie "Concussion" is going to be so stupid. We've always known what caused brain damage in Football.
@mikefreemanNFL Why do I feel like if I watch the movie @Concussion I'll never watch an NFL game the same again?
No lie I feel like watching the movie concussion would probably traumatize me for life after the amount of concussions I've had

@kylebrandt Naming that Will Smith NFL movie CONCUSSION is like naming the Charlie Sheen bio-pic HIV.

The NFL's right back in the middle of a concussion controversy weeks before the movie Concussion comes out. Godspeed.

@EboSays Concussion movie commercial. When Will Smith says "TELL THE TRUTH" I keep waiting for "I'M THE CAPTAIN NOW!" to follow.
Thought that commercial was a joke about this concussion movie. They gotta be kidding that they're actually putting that out
If releasing the concussion movie the same time as Star Wars isn't the biggest "f%@k you" set up for failure, I don't know what is.
I need somebody to take me on a date to see that movie called concussion on Christmas
