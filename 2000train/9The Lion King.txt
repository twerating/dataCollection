The lion king will always remind me of you. The lion king will always be your movie. So many memories
@Pumz_K It took me a while to realise it's the 'Timon and Pumba' version of the Lion King movie.
@WampusCatJoe I mean in his defense the lion king was a pretty badass movie
It's not usually a happily ever after if you're one of the parents in a Disney movie. From "The Lion King" to "Bambi" to "Frozen," things
For the 1st time I watched the Lion King movie & still don't get enough time to fished it. Is now 21 year since the movie was made #LionKing

@trillballins it's not accurate in terms of the lion king movie. Scar wasnt there in that scene.
Colombiana is the only movie I've watched more than once, excluding The Lion King of course.
No movie will ever mean as much to me as The Lion King does.

I will fight you if you think Elton John's versions of the Lion King songs are better than the movie versions.
Just watched a video of a man covering The Lion King's "Circle of Life" and now I just want to watch every single Disney movie.
I LIKE THE LION KING ALRIGHT ITS A GOOD MOVIE THINGS HAPPEN https://instagram.com/p/6TwvRYOnD7/ 
The Lion King has to be the most beautiful Disney movie ever made. Just think about the time and research put in to make the music& animals
watching the lion king musical brings back so many emotions. Hard to believe I was born the year this Disney movie came out.
When I was small I was obsessed with The Lion King. I watched the movie literally every other day.
