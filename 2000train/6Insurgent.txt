@history_hoffman @volpayno the Insurgent movie made UNIKA and I mad. We were on our phones nearing the end of the movie
Insurgent was literally the worst movie ever. My grandmother who has worse vision than Harry Potter can make better visual effects than that
Ever since I saw Insurgent I knew the next movie was not going to follow the book

To anyone who read the Divergent series are you as disappointed with the Insurgent movie as I am?
lmao I hate insurgent so much it's almost funny if it didn't make me miserable because I expected so much from that movie
I'm just gonna pretend the insurgent movie didn't happen
+ when insurgent was released and it was pure crap, if people were disappointed with the 2nd movie, they will most likely not see Allegiant
idk I thought the Insurgent trailer wasn't all that and I still enjoyed the film so I'll wait to have a solid opinion until the movie is out
When the movie came out I dyed my hair like tris for to cosplay as her . I lover the 1st movie and all the book but insurgent it was awful
is alligient gonna be a good movie? i need to know now so i can sit and watch insurgent bc i didn't like the first one at all oops

@benemarquis10 @izbanewood i didn't like the insurgent movie the divergent one was better
@itsabooksworld hahaha Insurgent is okay as an action movie but shitty as an adaptation
i saw insurgent with my friends and during the whole movie they were just talking about how hot theo is and theyre trying to teach me shit
This Divergent Series: Divergent, Insurgent, Allegiant et al..they should just make one movie and call it Convergent
@claceforeverx @benemarquis10 read it!! insurgent was the best of the three and I was so disappointed with how they did with the movie
this movie begins right where Insurgent left off and yet her hair is longer...
Also true. “Insurgent” was a bad movie from a weak-to-negligible book. “Allegiant” was just awful on the page. https://twitter.com/PootND/status/665229222651297792 …
@TMI_Uruguay yeah but I forgot that it's based on a book in the Insurgent movie so it's not that hard for me haha
Tris' allegiant movie hair is more how I imagined it in the insurgent and allegiant books
tbh insurgent movie kind of ruined it bc i thought it will kept up with the book but then ugh
i kind of miss my divergent days but the insurgent movie ruined it for me :(

How r they going to explain tris's hair growth from insurgent to allegiant in the movie?
no offense but why are people mad that the movie looks different than the book? after the insurgent movie shouldn't that be expected lol
I hate the divergent movie series so much i couldnt even make it through insurgent
@Blakesgecko agree! I loved the books and the first movie was amazing, but Insurgent was just a disaster...
i completely lost my excitement in the divergent movie series after the disaster that insurgent was but i love tris way to much smh
Divergent was such a good movie but Insurgent just wasn't
I hope Allegiant won't be like the Insurgent movie
This exact day both two years ago and last year we got movie posters for Divergent and Insurgent. I hope that's what's coming for Allegiant!
I can't be the only Divergent fan whose pissed off with the movie version of Insurgent and the trailer for Allegiant. What a let down!

NOPE NOPE I won't be watching scorch trials or insurgent or any movie adopted from books bc I'll just be disappointed and pissed off
The movie insurgent is so good
I've finished the Divergent book, chapter 21 on Insurgent, and i must say the movie is definitely different from the book.
@herongraystears I'm sorry but I didn't like insurgent that much compared to the other two and RN my fav movie is Jurassic world SO
The Action Choice Movie this year is between Jurassic World, Scorch Trials, and Insurgent..... Damn

insurgent was the best book of the entire series same goes for the movie
James Franco brother is fine, the main guy on insurgent the movie is fine, Justin Timberlake always fine, the Irish guy in my class is fine.
@deray the book was really good. Insurgent (the next movie after Divergent) wasn't as good in either version IMO
if i was the divergent marketing campaign i'd be focusing on the movie and not fourtris considering how insurgent underperformed like wtf
@deray the follow up movie, Insurgent, is......less good

kinda don't know what to do, soo movie time ★ Insurgent — https://path.com/p/47pgsH 
Insurgent was a good movie but I don't think I could watch it everyday like I watch divergent.
finally done watching insurgent and even tho a LOT changed from the book but damn the movie tho
So I just finished reading Insurgent and it's NOTHING like the movie. They don't really even resemble each other.
Wow, insurgent was a really good movie
Hunger Games, Insurgent and Maze Runner almost exaclty the same Sh... Movie series
Still haven't seen Insurgent yet. The book is great, I'm just afraid it will be a huge let down like every other movie based off of a novel.
"Insurgent" is such an amazing movie!
“ @SantanaLeeB: @imaginator1dx what movie is that in your snapchat??” Insurgent
Insurgent is so good. So good. As a movie. Not as an adaption. BUT IT IS GOOD.
Rare instances I've done that include the Insurgent movie, but in my defense I just couldn't get past the Divergent novel.
My friend sends me this snap..... He's got a good sense in choice on what movie to watch. #Insurgent @divergent pic.twitter.com/HlGeCMgqk2
I've said it before , Maze Runner,Hunger games &Insurgent should have been 1 movie.
One for the D-List Hunger Games movie please. 'Insurgent isn't on tonight.' No, the other one. 'One for the Scorch Trials it is.'

no book has ever pissed me off like insurgent has, the movie was incredible but the book is completely different
Insane plot twist at the end of Insurgent. I kinda guessed it from the first movie to be honest. Great movie! Very intense!
Why does Insurgent always put random sex/make out scenes in dead spots in the movie. There isn't any reason to put them in...

@Bc_Ally omg me too like I can't finish itbut insurgent is nothing like the book/: but still a great movie
@BiancaGtv the movie theatre here at JMU was playing Insurgent & I almost went even though I've seen it like 4 times already
But I remember when I saw the Insurgent trailer, I didn't like it and thought the movie would be bad.
The fact that they changed the Part 2 of the movie to a completely different name and the fact that they screwed up insurgent.....oh lord
It's hard to be excited for Allegiant when it was the worst book and Insurgent was a crap movie
@magicalmolly yeah I feel like the end of insurgent (book) was so exciting and the movie not so much.
Divergent was so good and they done so well from moving book to movie, but Insurgent i felt they just created a whole new story :/
The insurgent movie and book were such a let down for me. Im sure Allegiant will be the same.
Insurgent was such a good movie I can't wait for the next one
@ZanessaVashley @twerkingtobias I know right, after watching Insurgent I've seen that there taking a different approach to the movie
@MattCrazy_ I'm not going to watch either of them. Not after the Insurgent movie
the guy who directed 'insurgent' directed 'the time travelers wife'. that was an AMAZING movie. the script for 'insurgent' was just crap.
Personally, I liked the Maze Runner movie better than Divergent/Insurgent.

I think im one of the few people that actually loved Insurgent. I know it was not exactly like the book but as a movie it was perfect to me.
insurgent is my fave book out of the series and my fave movie so far but allegiant movie seems so fucking good from the teaser holy shit
i haven't finish reading insurgent yet so obviously I haven't seen the movie so don't spoil me on allegiant k? thank you very much

My suspicions were correct. Tris' hair grows in the movie so Allegiant has to take place enough time after the end of Insurgent @Divergent

Good because I watched divergent, insurgent, the maze runner, the gallows, and the pyramid not much beats a movie day in bed!

Sometimes I wish I could have a do over when I rent a movie. Insurgent is a boring turd of a movie.
hands down insurgent movie
Insurgent is without a doubt the WORST movie I've seen in a while. Hey @dweebfactory, don't abuse yourself by watching that crap hole film.
I hope they don't change the ending in the movie, they changed too much in "Insurgent" so at least they shoud end the movie as the book says
Just saw the movie insurgent and now my whole memory of the book is kaput. The characters had the same names at least?
My head really hurts and all I want is to watch Insurgent and have a root beer float. I don't have the the movie or the float
the insurgent movie literally has nothing to do with the book I am so annoyed
@cricketspillane Insurgent honestly set it up to be an entirely different movie and apparently that was their plan
@Gabo_156 @fangirl_alert74 I got a bit bored reading Insurgent, for me at least the movie had some things new
I hate reading a book then watching the movie then seing how unralated the movie is to the book like really???!! Why tris why!! #Insurgent
INSURGENT and THE LONGEST RIDE tonight. #movie night
@MissyPrissy12 I liked the insurgent movie, but I didn't like the book. I had to make myself finish it...same with the third
@rachelduncann_ I read online that allegiant the movie is suppose to be closer to the book than insurgent was but now they're adding stuff?
Insurgent is a great movie!

Whatever you do, dont waste about 120minutes of your life to watch Insurgent (2015)! #movie #wastedtime
I just said "SHADOW CLONE JITSU!" at this stupid Insurgent movie so I guess it was worth watching after all.
Could #Insurgent be the movie that derails any hope for the Divergent franchise? 2/5 stars for a disappointing movie. http://sottunderground.blogspot.com/2015/08/did-insurgent-derail-any-hope-for.html …

Wow. The Insurgent movie was way different than the book. It was pretty good but characters acted out of their normal behaviors too much.
Insurgent was a good ass movie
Just watched Insurgent for the first time! Awesome movie!!! Disappointed that there was no scene at the end of the credits though...
The dialogue in this movie is unmotivated and filled with cliches. "Dark times call for desperate measures." #Insurgent
Truth serum to produce more expositional dialogue. This might be "exposition: the movie." #Insurgent
watching Insurgent... Divergent was a good ass movie hopefully this movie which is part 2 is just as good
Watching my brother's dog watch my cat play with is more entertaining than this movie. #Insurgent pic.twitter.com/ot4ssbUf4N

sometimes i think about how different the insurgent movie was from the book nd i feel like dying
In Insurgent they needed 1 Divergent 2 open the box, why didnt they use 1 person from each faction to open it. Just solved the whole movie.

YES! Furious 7 won!!! If Insurgent won, I would kill someone!!! Furious 7 is a real movie with actual actors who are talented peace ️
Watched Insurgent, pretty good movie. I imagine that’s how life would be with Hillary Clinton running the show.
I recommend everyone to listen to the following movie soundtracks: twilight, breaking dawn, tfios, paper towns, divergent, & insurgent
Just for the record... Insurgent the movie was almost nothing like the Insurgent the book & I find that quite upsetting.
Insurgent the movie is NOTHING like Insurgent the book. I'm livid
I want to say congrats that Shai won for choice movie actress action and best liplock with Theo on #Insurgent.

Choice Movie Actress: Action/Adventure Shailene Woodley – “Insurgent”
@holymazerunner insurgent is a much bigger movie and shailene is a awesome actress they both deserved it
Miles Teller did not win choice movie stealer for Insurgent
insurgent is a great movie
Insurgent was a great movie
Insurgent is such a good movie !
When you can never decide on what movie you want to win an award (Maze Runner or Insurgent) and then neither of them win. D: Darn Furious 7.
After watching insurgent I'm pretty much obsessed w Theo James great movie
My mom was surprised that FF7 won the Action Movie award instead of Insurgent.
At least this fandom lets me know what a great action adventure movie is every time every day and no award will ever change that #Insurgent
I'm so mad right now that Insurgent didn't win Best Action/ Adventure movie :(
Insurgent did not win Choice Action Movie.
Although I LOVE Furious 7.... I feel like The Maze Runner or Insurgent should of one for Action/Adventure Movie.... They really deserved it
ALRIGHT WHOEVER YOU ARE IMMA LET YOU FINISH BUT INSURGENT WAD THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME
wtf is this insurgent and maze runner deserved it so much more bc they actually have a huge message behind the movie
So Insurgent didn't win.. that is what you get unfaithful movie adaptation.
I'm actually not too upset bc the movie wasn't THAT great, but still. I wanted it or insurgent to win
Insurgent should've won though (even though it's nothing like the movie but oh well)
AGHHH at least it went to a good movie. I'm happy for such a cool cast as much as I love insurgent(:
Insurgent did not win best action/adventure movie #TCA #TeenChoiceAwards
Choice Movie: Action Adventure kinda want Insurgent to win #TeenChoiceAwards
INSURGENT BEST BOOK BUT MOVIE COULD OF DONE BETTER
The book Insurgent was so good but the movie was horrible
Movie: Action/Adventure noms: Tracers, The Maze Runner, San Andreas, Kingsman: The Secret Service, Insurgent, Furious 7 #TeenChoiceAwards
I always forget that insurgent is a movie
Insurgent should win because that movie was actually really good
I liked the boom insurgent! not the movie! they changed it too much
Just finished watching insurgent... I have mixed feelings and was primarily bored the whole movie
@crushontheo insurgent got nominated for a bunch of stuff like best actor best actress best movie best kiss best villain etc
hats off to the props, artists, and set designers for Insurgent, this movie is visually stunning

drunk & trying to watch Insurgent and I have literally no idea what is happening in this movie
Let's see if they #Insurgent movie is as good as the book
Insurgent is the worst, most cliche, annoying, movie I have ever watched. What a waste of two hours.
insurgent is my favorite movie ever
@xoKallyMartina we should have a divergent, insurgent movie marathon day.....
my mom asked me what the third divergent movie is called and their watching insurgent and i accidentally said asurgent
INSURGENT SHOULD BE THE LAST DIVERGENT MOVIE/BOOK!! THERE SHOULD BE NO ALLEGIANT!
Awkward Caleb in the Insurgent movie is making my life right now.
I finished family movie night and the movies were great tonight. We watched insurgent and Jupiter ascending. They are both 10/10 movies!
Is it just me or the insurgent movie was a trash
@dandeIionlrh i read both insurgent and allegiant on thursday+friday and im so glad i did bc theyre so much better than the movie
@patster223 I haven't seen either movie and the trailer for Insurgent makes me so ?????????? what-- what even.
Man, Insurgent the movie is considerably different from the book.
Insurgent is a trippy movie to watch when you haven't slept properly in 3 weeks.

We watched Insurgent tonight... i just can't get into it. We've watched both & now obvi committed to watching the last movie but geeeez
and i just watched insurgent behind-the-scene movie it's gorgeous
This movie is a waste if time. Glad I didn't pay money to see it. #insurgent
About to find out how much the Insurgent movie differs from the book.
Hate watching movie adaptations of my fav YAnovels with hubs. He chuckled his way through #Insurgent so I'll just have to watch again alone!
Movie night: The DUFF and Insurgent. Robbie Amell & Theo James . . . say no more.
Insurgent was a dope movie I'm bout to watch it again
Family movie night: Insurgent. Hearing "erudite" pronounced with four syllables is really starting to bug me.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/-_SIOYdUMIY?a  Shailene Woodley, Theo James Full movies - Insurgent Full movie - Adventure sci fi
Insurgent would be a good movie if two of the main characters who play brother and sister on it didn't play lovers on The Fault In Our Stats

Remember in the Insurgent movie when Lynn di.... Oh wait, YOU CAN'T REMEMBER IT CAUSE THEY DIDN'T SHOW THAT PART
The main thing I'm taking away from this movie is "That's not how that happened" #Insurgent
Thought movie #Insurgent was action!?! Turns out its a talkie + chick flick god damn it. How can I erase this horror from my brain??
