Hollywood should do a remake of Sunset Blvd with Madonna in the Gloria Swanson role. Could be the perfect movie for her at this point.
#Birdman won because of its message on the industry and for being a movie about "them." With that mentality Sunset Blvd shoulda won. #Oscars

@_BiffHuxtable_ It'd be dope to drive down Sunset Blvd. and see some indie or low budget movie being filmed. Nostalgic as hell for me.
They're shooting scenes for the Entourage movie on Sunset Blvd. Beware. #trafficalert
Awesome!! Driving back from an audition, I just saw Ari Gold filming a scene for the Entourage Movie on Sunset Blvd. Very Surreal
Unrelated: the supposedly good movie about teachers that William Holden was writing in Sunset Blvd. sounds like a really boring movie.
@itsmechapina @congolia @tut___ at this rate we’re not gonna watch anything. I wanna see Sunset Blvd & he wants to see a movie w/ Jay Leno.
Sunset Blvd...the movie that is.
@1_bluesky1 @liltexasgal8 @russellcrowe @calrabbit sometimes I'd feel like I might drive off Sunset Blvd gawking @ huge movie billboards,etc
'Sunset Blvd' is on tv!!! Definitely a day-in-bed movie!
@SamNeuman I mean seriously. Why not let Glenn Close spend some time explaining why she never won an Oscar & plead for a Sunset Blvd. movie?
Sunset Blvd. is the perfect movie for silent movie fans with all the references, actors and fun clips.
Two stand out things about "Sunset Blvd." Young Jack Webb...and "aging" Norma Desmond role. Her age in movie?....50.
