Crossroads only has one star on Netflix and I'm like you've obviously never seen Crossroads since it's the greatest movie of all time.
I kinda hope that during one of Pensatucky's flashbacks in 'Orange" they just show a clip of the movie 'Crossroads'.
Crossroads is my favorite movie

I love the movie crossroads
Gah I always forget how much I love the movie crossroads!
You know it's not your night in bar trivia when the first question is about who wrote the Brittany Spears movie, "Crossroads."
We lived for like 2 + MOS under the yoke of Vin Thugs Harmony. That movie was 2 hours of "Crossroads".
@mjecclestone Ever seen the movie "Smoke Signals"? It's like the character who gave the traffic report by sitting at the crossroads+
Alright, let's talk about how good of a movie Crossroads is
Omg crossroads is on!! I used to love this movie
guitar duel at the end of Crossroads still one of my favorite musical moments in a movie
also I'm seriously questioning life after the movie crossroads. DID SHE STAY IN LA? WHAT ABOUT BEN???
What's worse crying over the movie crossroads or crying Bc someone said they seen something .. Cuz I did both tonight
Ashamed to say it but Crossroads was a great movie @showmaker_
Crossroads is the best movie
Crossroads was such a bad movie but the inner 90s Britney fan in me just loves it
"I'm watching that Brittany spears movie" "Crossroads? You're gay ..... I saw it in theaters with my mom"
Just had a horrible flashback after seeing Britney Spears wear them in the movie Crossroads. Hahaha THESE pic.twitter.com/8nsBeHOgN1
When your mom finally decides to treat herself to a movie AND SHE ENDS UP WATCHING @britneyspears Crossroads!!! I'm a proud son.
Can't sleep bc "Crossroads" is on tv! I love Britney Spears in this movie!
aww, my old movie "crossroads" on.
Pause. Crossroads is a badass movie period! #Girlpower
I forgot how much the movie Crossroads rocks my world
Watching #crossroads my favorite movie!! @britneyspears
Crossroads is on MTV!! Literally my favorite movie when I was little
Aye ya'll sleeping if you don't think crossroads was a good movie. That was prime Brittany Spears.
Crossroads forgot how much I loved that movie, such a Britney Spears throwback!
Just rewatched Crossroads 4 shits & giggs. Arguably worst movie ever. So 90s that it hurts. I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Women also hurts. BAD.
crossroads is on...haven't seen this movie in years
Omg!!! They're playing Crossroads! I love this movie. Young Britney, Taryn and Zoey.
The movie crossroads was my favorite movie.
Have you ever seen Crossroads? Nostalgia omg its on m... — yes! I used to loveeee the movie back when I was youn... http://ask.fm/a/c7l9k5df 
Crossroads is on. The 2002 movie with Britney Spears this is a dream
But crossroads>> any other movie
Crossroads is a weird movie but it's kinda good idk
Pennsatucky was in the movie Crossroads?! Whaaaat
Crossroads is literally the greatest movie ever
Omg I haven't seen crossroads in so long this was my movie
That moment when you realize for the first time Justin Long is in the movie #CrossRoads !!!
Crossroads is on, on @MTV omg literally haven't seen this movie since I was like 8. Wow I'm really happy right now
They're showing crossroads right now.. i used to watch this movie like a hundred times hahaha
SHUT UP. Crossroads just started on MTV. Haven't seen this movie in FOREVER.
Awwwwh I love this movie #crossroads
Crossroads is on, this was my favorite movie when I was like 7 & I haven't seen it since then

Idc what anybody says, but Crossroads with @britneyspears @zoesaldana @TarynManning will always be my favorite movie
lmao in crossroads when Mimi has a baby bump for the first half of the movie then when she loses the baby it just completely disappears ????
I'm at a crossroads, like the Britney Spears movie.
Tb to the movie Crossroads
Just chillin and watching Crossroads on Netflix. What are you doing? Also, Zoe Saldana has the best singing voice by far in this movie.
Britney Spear's movie "Crossroads" is listed under comedies. I take issue.
Half baked is definitely my favorite "stoner" movie
Can we just appreciate the movie "Crossroads" that shit was my bestfriend/relationship goals since 2002 pic.twitter.com/lze29D9FVd
I forgot there were a ton of handheld camera shots. Not b/c the movie wanted to be edgy, but because it didn't have a budget. #crossroads
I forgot this movie started with a voiceover. I've been watching so much Greys Anatomy that I got so confused, like, "Meredith?" #crossroads
People who say Crossroads is a bad movie are right, only because it isn't a movie. It's an art form.
super excited to stay home tonight, because I'm gonna have a dance party & watch my fav movie everrrrr crossroads okay I'll stop
So, Bad Movie Club's screening Crossroads tonight. It finally happened. I'm actually kind of dreading a showing. #sendbooze

Score 72: Crossroads (2002). This is the Britney Spears movie, also called 'Scrabble with Nutmeg', for some reason! http://ow.ly/MW0Aa 
Somebody needs to come over and watch Crossroads with me. Preferably someone who will sing along with the movie and provide snacks.

In the 2002 movie "Crossroads" Britney Spears took a Road trip with Taryn Manning & Zoe Saldana.

The depths of nonsense to which this movie reaches defy 140 characters. Plausibility flew out the window two states ago. #Crossroads
Do I dare watch the movie #Crossroads starring Britney Spears right now? My brain needs a holiday from the world tonight.
Crossroads is a seriously great movie. The Ralph Macchio one, not the one with Britney Spears..
Shonda Rhimes wrote the movie Crossroads with Britney, that explains so much
Everytime this particular song come on at my job i think of that crossroads movie...then I get embarrassed I seen it
