Why has no one made a Santa Claus movie starring Brian Blessed What is wrong with this world
Epiphany; the title of the movie "The Santa Clause" means that it's a clause saying he becomes Santa Claus & it's not just his name...
I legit spent most of my young life thinking Santa Claus was spelled "Santa Clause" because I did not understand that movie title was a pun.
i thought Santa Claus had an "e" at the end of the name because of the Tim Allen movie for the majority of my life tbh
Any movie with Tim Allen is god awful, except for the Santa Claus movies. He really turned it around for those.
u know the movie the year without a santa claus well they should make one titled "the year without one direction" it'll be a big hit
Watching the Santa Claus movie with my lil' sister
The Santa Claus is such a good movie
Just FYI: According to PR from Santa Claus, donating money to Hollywood professionals to make a TV show or movie isn't actually charity.
The Best Die Hard movie is a Year Without Santa Claus

My favorite christmas movie is back THE SANTA CLAUS
@pfenomenologist (I only know of that colour due to the 80's "Santa Claus, the movie".)
I always used to spell santa claus, santa clause because of the santa clause movie & I was always confused why ppl told me it was wrong
The Santa Claus is easily my favorite Christmas movie.
Tonight's Christmas movie is Mrs. Santa Claus. It's never too early to start instilling pro-labor and pro-musical sentiments in your kids!
I can no longer say I've never seen SANTA CLAUS: THE MOVIE (Szwarc, 1985)
My favorite Christmas movie is either The Year Without A Santa Claus or The Perfect Holiday

The Santa Claus is my favorite Christmas movie
The Year Without a Santa Claus is hands down the best Christmas movie and it's not even close
Home Alone is the best Xmas movie followed by the Santa Claus
Dear abc family could you please play another movie because the Santa Claus has been on EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

Santa Claus 1 will always be my favorite Christmas movie
I feel like I am dreaming. I thought Santa Claus was spelt Santa Clause my whole life. And now I am realizing thats just the movie title.
Honestly the only really good "Christmas" song is "Zat You Santa Claus" and that's because it sounds like a horror movie theme
"The Santa Clause" is a top five Christmas movie. And the reason everyone spells Santa Claus wrong.
"The Santa Claus" is my favorite Christmas movie

New idea for a movie: 'Santa Claus' wins the write-in vote and all persons legally named such have to fight it out to be POTUS. TO THE DEATH
The tv description for the movie Santa Claus is Coming to Town is "A mailman explains Santa."
Watching the Santa Claus, love this movie

Cannot believe @aliceexeter7 ! Watching Santa Claus the movie behind my back !
@AlisonJBurge think it may be films such as miracle on 34th street (40s version) and Santa Claus the movie (80s?) that changed things

The year without Santa Claus will forever be the best Christmas movie
Christmas Movie Power Rankings: 1. Elf 2. Christmas Vacation 3. A Christmas Story 4. Home Alone 5. The Santa Claus
It's interesting how every Christmas movie is basically Santa Claus fan fiction.
while i know this movie is nearly 70 years old, there's something astounding about the actor playing Santa Claus being born in 1877 #RCTID
I think it's safe to say that the tie for "best Christmas movie" goes to The Santa Clause and Mrs. Santa Claus. Angela Lansbury kills it.
The Santa Claus 2 is such an underrated movie. I love it so much.

My 3rd favorite thing about the movie "The Santa Claus" is that the North Pole is an actual pole.
That moment when some1 posts a pic on Insta of the movie Santa Claus is coming to town w/ a caption that says year without a Santa Claus
I've loved this movie since I was little. Which raises the question: Why as a child was I okay with Tim Allen murdering Santa Claus?
Fact: my family is watching a Christmas movie featuring Rudolph, Ben franklin, a caveman, a knight. Santa Claus and Father Time. #what?????
Santa Claus Is Comin to Town will forever be the best Christmas movie ever

@ZoeMelisko @StayGoldenKid anything is a Christmas movie once you put a fucking Santa Claus hat on.
The Year Without a Santa Claus is my favorite Christmas movie
Just realized "The Santa Clause" movie title literally means the Santa CLAUSE, not THE Santa Claus. Shocked and impressed.
I can't believe this movie is literally about some dude killing Santa Claus
I honestly did not realize that there was a worse Christmas movie than MST3K's "Santa Claus". Thanks, Ice Cream Bunny, for proving me wrong.
My roommate didn't get dinner today because she was too busy watching The Santa Claus movie
Santa Claus and the ice cream bunny is the best movie I have ever seen by far
Drink every time Tim Allen says "Charlie get down from there!" In the Santa Claus movie
The first Santa Claus movie it 21 years old
I went 25 years thinking Santa Claus was spelled Santa Clause because of the movie. "Santa Claus" still looks wrong to me.
They need to make another The Santa Claus movie and make it wherr Tim Allen retires and Charlie becomes Santa.
I don't know what Christmas movie this is on abc family but it's sad as shit it's about Santa Claus as a kid and his brother Fred
Just watched The Santa Claus with Tim Allen...still my favorite Christmas movie
they should make a 4th Santa Claus movie where Charlie takes over the family business and becomes Santa.
Still waiting on a new Santa Claus movie where Charlie becomes Santa..
Santa Claus with Tim Allen will always be my favorite Christmas movie of all time.
My favorite Christmas movie is the original Santa Claus movie with Tim Allen.
The Santa Claus movie is one of my favourite Christmas movies

Can we all agree to correctly spell "Santa Claus" this year? Don't add an extra e to Claus unless you are talking about the Tim Allen movie.

This might be controversial, but The Year Without A Santa Claus is obvs the best Christmas claymation movie.
@PaperWash The real Santa played himself in Santa Claus the Movie. His name was changed in the credits to David Huddleston for protection
It's not CLAUSE. Some people don't understand the Tim Allen movie was a PUN cause he was under a clause in a contract to be Santa Claus.

Miracle on 34th Street (4/5) Movie CLIP - The One and Only Santa Claus (... https://youtu.be/jagJeaLXRRQ  via @YouTube
Christmas Movie Rankings: 1.) Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town 2.) Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer 3.) Home Alone 4.) The Santa Clause 5.) Elf
My ideal Christmas movie would be a Blade remake where Blade is replaced by Jesus and Whistler is Santa Claus.

Watching a movie about an elephant who travels, with a scarecrow and a flying pig, inside of a whale to meet Santa Claus. It's beautiful.
The third Santa Claus movie stresses me out.
Did they really make a horror movie out of Christmas? Is Santa Claus going to be living a secret double life as a crazy killer?
