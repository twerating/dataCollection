@alovething @shes_a_gdb That's Paul Rudd!? Hahaha...is that from Mac And Me? I loved that movie as a kid.
@MST3K I gave $ to a friend to donate. You now owe me Mac And Me, or a reb brown movie of your choice. Do it.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/tPgRnFg8ZTU?a  Mac and Me (8/11) Movie CLIP - McDonald's Dance Party (1988) HD
One day I will be a guest on Conan. When he asks me to play a movie clip, I will answer with the Mac and Me wheelchair scene.
I had a dream that I saw Mac and Me and it was a great movie and I didn't understand why everyone made fun of it and it made me sad
@JMV1070 best branding in a movie was McDonalds all over "Mac and Me". Dance number with aliens and kids at McDonalds
Well, it took a little while but we finally programmed the official "Mac and Me" movie video game for the Atari 2600.

I am currently at the McDonalds scene of Mac and Me. This scene is the reason this movie exists.
Movie idea: Paul Rudd plays a substitute teacher who goes to every class and plays Mac and Me.
looking forward to next Paul Rudd's movie so when he gets on Conan he can show us the Mac and Me footage.

Mac And Me may be the Devil in movie form, but at least it brought @Crushanator2, @Higher_Boy & I together in hilarious disdain! Fun times!
Yes, @BillCorbett , Mac and Me is a real movie. A real movie that NEEDS to be riffed! And the riff of #TheWizard is awesome, by the way.

If you didn't like ET you don't have a soul. You can hate Mac and Me. That movie was deranged.
@woodyandwilcox for the last 15 years + when Paul Rudd promotes a movie on Conan show he shows the same clip from Mac and Me. Corny clip 2.
This movie's plot is slightly better than "mac and me" or "mannequin", but the bad music, stereotypes, and dolph lundgren make it awesome.
@cakikeith it is from the horrible movie "Mac and Me." :P
@DarickR Paul Rudd shows a clip from Mac and Me on talk shows to promote his newest movie. No matter the movie.

If I'm ever in California and Paul Rudd is on Conan promoting a new movie I am buying a ticket just for the Mac and Me clip
My wife just contested Mac and Me was a good movie. Now I'm forcing her to watch it again. Then, well listen to the @HDTGM episode together.
Honestly a bit disappointed the Mac and me scene didn't appear in Ant Man haha jk overall good movie.
It's all I wanted. For the Mac and me clip to play at the end. For Paul Rudd to have extended his stupid prank to a Marvel Movie
Ant man was surprisingly great! I love you Paul Rudd. Still pissed they didn't play the Mac And Me clip at the end of the movie
@BunchDevan I was trying to find Mac and me on Netflix and that movie popped up
Has anybody ever seen the movie Mac and me?? Gosh I used to love it

Hey @ER_NoTR have you put yourself through Mac and Me yet for your drunken movie adventures?
It's hilarious to realize that every time Paul Rudd uses that Mac and Me clip you usually get a spree of, "Wait that's a real movie?"
Paul Rudd can be in Oscar nominated movie, be on Conan and still use the Mac and Me clip.
Part of me wants to advertise a live movie riffing of a Paul Rudd movie, but actually do a live riff of Mac and Me
@AntMan is the whole movie really just Mac and Me?
@gavondo Possibly my new most anticipated movie of the year. You know, since we already did Mad Mac and Me...I mean Mad Max.
The entire Mac and Me movie is online, soooo there goes my motivation today. https://youtu.be/Sm6t_jzH05M

I forgot that new huge movie with Paul Rudd means Mac and Me on Conan
@jdavidflynn even as a kid, I remember rooting *against* both Mac and Me by the end of the movie. Totally hateable characters.
I never get tired of seeing Paul Rudd on @ConanOBrien @TeamCoco and showing the Mac and Me movie clip. It makes me laugh every time.
Yes!! Paul Rudd on @ConanOBrien and he showed the Mac and me movie clip mixed with Ant Man!! He did it again!!! So hilarious!! #loveit
@TeamCoco I didn't know I needed it, but I now need a Mac and Me and @AntMan crossover movie in my life.
Omg Mac and me what a great movie @PP_III do you remember it?!!
Paul Rudd setting up a clip from Mac and Me instead of a movie he's promoting on Conan is the greatest
Paul Rudd showing that Mac and Me clip every time he has to promote a movie on Conan is my MOST FAVORITE THING EVER. I love you, Paul Rudd.
Paul Rudd is gonna be on Conan. I know what he's going to do; bring a clip to show his new movie, instead, it's a clip from Mac and Me.
Paul Rudd is on Conan tonight, if anyone is interested in seeing a clip from his new movie "Mac and Me." #Conan #PaulRudd

Anyone who says "The wheelchair scene from Mac and Me" hasn't seen Mac and Me. The whole movie has a kid in a wheelchair.
Every time I try to watch Mac and Me, something comes up. I started the movie on Saturday. I still have half an hour left.
As a naive movie optimist, the Ant-Man trailer's got me hype. Still mostly looking forward to Paul Rudd's Mac and Me clip on Conan though.
Just turned on Mac and Me. This will be the second time I've seen the movie, the millionth time I've seen the wheelchair hill scene.

Everyone can be "meh" about the #AntManTrailer all they want. New Paul Rudd movie means another Mac and Me appearance on @ConanOBrien.

Windmills for miles! Reminds me so much of my childhood favorite movie, Mac and Me. I've never met… http://instagram.com/p/v9rWGpjlVy/ 
I think someone should replace the score in Mac and Me with a horror movie score and just see what it does. Because dear god.
@eli_gone_crazy @jackalsworth @SignBeetle @Shanefel maybe a safer alien related movie. How about Mac and Me!
I'm watching Mac and Me and this fucking movie is amazing~ cx

@Zicmilitary then again, you may have not been born when the movie MAC and Me was released, so you wouldn't get that. Lol
@earthsandwich Can we just all agree that Mac and Me was arguably the worst movie ever made? @OffQuality
Mac and Me was a real movie that someone pitched to a production company and filmed for $13M. It actually happened.
As a Harry Potter movie side-note, Dobby the house-elf was HORRIBLY designed. I think he was an attempt to do "Mac and Me's" Mac in CGI.
I could swear this is where they filmed that 80's movie "Mac and Me." #cali #phoenixdisneytrip2014 http://instagram.com/p/qIA8VzNdZL/

@ConanOBrien I would have died of laughter tonight if Chastain's movie clip was from Mac and Me as well dont know why but it had me loling
