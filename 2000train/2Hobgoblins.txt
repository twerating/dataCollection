in other news, the MC from HOBGOBLINS is playing Phil Hartman in a movie: http://www.avclub.com/article/daran-norris-star-phil-hartman-biopic-directed-jas-229222 …
God do I HATE the movie Hobgoblins featured in MST3K ep 907. Fuck.
The best MST3K movie is Hobgoblins, by probably 80% margin
After HOBGOBLINS, OUTLAW OF GOR seems like the #mst3k movie you're most likely to catch a disease from. #MST3KTurkeyDay #BringBackMST3K
Hobgoblins doesn't get enough love. It's the most USA Up All Night movie MST3K did. When I watch, I expect Rhonda to show up in the theater.
Felicia Mad: "Today's movie is Red: Werewolf Hunter" Everyone: "Can we watch Hobgoblins 2 instead?! Please?!"
Don't forget, at 8 PM PST tonight we will commence with Bad Movie Night - Hobgoblins! Check back later for a link! pic.twitter.com/C1nq2MHE0e

Based on relativity, Hobgoblins is a 10-hour movie. They appear about 2/5 of the way in and Mike quips "4 hours in." #MST3K

In summary, Hobgoblins, a movie on MST3K is not very good.
alright so I'm a bit confused about the movie "Hobgoblins" memorably riffed on the television show #mst3k
I’m very late with this one, but it’s bad movie catch up time. This week Gremlins rip-off #Hobgoblins #100badmovies

Hobgoblins is the perfect example of a movie that males no God damn sense and is wonderful all at the same time. It's just stupid silly fun.
I am really looking forward to next week's movie. It's #36 and it's the brilliant Hobgoblins (1988). #100badmovies

Hobgoblins has to be the worst movie ever made. Literally the worst. That's not an exaggeration.
Hobgoblins. A movie so terrible that it's own director gave it to MST3K to tear apart.

Now I am watching 0907 Hobgoblins, which is basically next to Manos The Hands of Fate for worst movie ever #MST3k
@AnthonyCumia Was 38DD "Fantasia" from the movie "Hobgoblins"?
@ousontles I have a hard time watching Hobgoblins because the movie just repulses me, even though it's also some of their best riffing.
Even MST3K can’t make Hobgoblins an enjoyable movie.

"That sure was a bad movie, won't you?" Thanks Mike. Worth rewinding to hear twice! LOL (Hobgoblins, MST3K)
@Soulthynis funny you mention gremlins because I just watched this movie called hobgoblins & it was so lame but a nice piece of the 80s lol
Am I wrong for thinking the movie "Hobgoblins" is one of the best-worst films ever made! Sorry fans of Troll 2 and The Room.
Why yes, I do have “Kiss Kicker 99” from the Fontanelles… which is a song from the B-Movie Hobgoblins, as seen on MST3K.
@parkernow To start, there are no hobgoblins in the movie and Gozer is a demigod, not a demon.
Just realized that I have the PERFECT Halloween movie: MST3K’s “Hobgoblins”.

@freckles42 Zach is singing "Hobgoblins" in a sad, slow, minor key because he's sad he can't go to the march 9 movie day. It's kinda amazing
Why as only the #MST3K movie got a blu ray release? I want blu ray releases of episodes like Manos or Puma-man or Hobgoblins.
@luck_mode Hobgoblins is probably the 80s est bad 'horror' movie ever. I recoment the MST3k episode version.
@rayson_toast I did too but I just watched "hobgoblins" and it's quite possibly the worst movie ever made.

I'm intrigued by this old 80's movie "Hobgoblins"...it's so bad but I can't stop watching it
Current office discussion: Worst movie ever made - "The Room" or "Hobgoblins"?
Hobgoblins (1988) ★ 1.7 92 min - Comedy | Fantasy | Horror - 14 July 1988 (USA) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089280/
@ryee40007 Any movie called Hobgoblins is bound to be bad.
Certain parts of this movie make me think of Hobgoblins, while others make me think of The Room, both awesomely bad movies.
@tj855 Have you done Hobgoblins yet? It's a weird action/comedy/romance/horror movie that manages to do none of those.
@CollectorManiac I'm just discovering that! I did not know he was Cosmo! Nor that he was in the movie Hobgoblins!
#MST3Kthoughts In the movie "Hobgoblins" , the actors and crew are scarier and slimier than the actual Hobgoblin monsters.
Decided on in my opinion the worst movie they ever riffed: Hobgoblins! I can already feel the shame. #MST3K
Tonight's movie: Hobgoblins!
this movie is giving me current traumatic stress disorder #mst3k #hobgoblins
Watching Hobgoblins. This movie is amazing.
jesus christ Hobgoblins is a horrible movie.
I've got movie sign! #Hobgoblins ...then I got sleep sign.
Hobgoblins is the best B movie ever!
40 minutes into GI Joe: Rise of Cobra and it's already the dumbest movie I've ever seen. And I've seen #Hobgoblins.
@Laslo_Panaflex best movie: Hobgoblins. Worst movie: Hands of fate. Your turn...
I never thought I'd see a movie with more parking scenes than Hobgoblins, but then I watched Birdemic.
Amazon Prime has free movie streaming!? Great! Now I can watch Hobgoblins any time I want. Or not.
@alex_navarro i can do it with one movie. Hobgoblins, directed by Rick Sloane.
@theroseinbloom Pod People, Cave Dwellers, Time Chasers, MST3k The Movie, Werewolf, Final Sacrifice. Hobgoblins. All available on Netflix.
@blackestaria Hobgoblins could be considered bad movie fun as well, but 2 was intentional.
@lena1376 I haven't seen Hobgoblins but 2 sound like a lot of bad movie fun.
We have ways of dealing ne'er-do-wells who insist on jumping on our rent-to-own couches. Your movie (AGHHH!) is called....Hobgoblins! #mst3k
@Rio_Youers Are you kidding me? I can recite entire swaths of that movie from memory. I mean, spooks, hobgoblins...
dear @michaeljnelson I've been traumatized by Hobgoblins. how did u recover from this movie?
Useless fact: The guy who played the MC in MST3kified movie Hobgoblins went on to an epic voice acting career. "Greetings, lowlifes."
The Club Scum host from the movie Hobgoblins. #MountainTimeZoneNewYearsHosts #MST3K
Favorite "Bad" Movie?: In my opinion bad movies are critters like troll 2, hobgoblins, batman forever or the roo... http://bit.ly/fKHG2N
@syourh I still think the Werewolf riff is my favorite, but Laserblast is a worse movie... Hobgoblins still worst period though.
RT @SpookyJanelle: Leprechaun 3 and Hobgoblins might be the same movie... ][ hobgoblins is a win and a half
@LexxxiLockhart Hobgoblins is one I actually think isn't a TERRIBLE movie on its own. its just better with the guys :)
Tom Servo going back in time to kick Rick Sloan in the chins before he creates the film Hobgoblins. Now there's a movie idea.
"Boy, that sure is a bad movie, won't you?" #Hobgoblins
Watching the MST3K episode "Hobgoblins." One of my favorites. Movie itself is barely watchable, but that makes the episode better. =D
I'm going to give you SUCH a movie. #MST3K #Hobgoblins
This movie is particularly painful, even with Mike & the bots #ouch #MST3K #Hobgoblins
Watching MST3K 09x07: Hobgoblins. Honestly, this movie is just silly, maybe I wouldn't think that if I saw it without MST3K. Funny episode.
MST3K – Favorite Moments – Hobgoblins: My favorite moments of Hobgoblins – an incredibly bad movie, but funny as hell. http://bit.ly/athE9y
@AWDtwit Depends on the movie. Hell, I wish Hobgoblins was more of a slasher movie for that reason sometimes.
Finally saw the "Hobgoblins" episode of MST3K. When a movie's most sympathetic character is a vault door, something's gone horribly wrong.
Thanks to everyone that re-tweeted my Hobgoblins video review. Watching that movie was a dark chapter in my life. Glad people enjoyed it.
wanna laugh your ass off? Watch this review of a bad movie, Hobgoblins http://www.thefearinside.com/2010/09/27/cheap-tuesday-hobgoblins/
Wow. Hobgoblins. ( http://imdb.to/a2gXhG ) I can't believe this is an actual movie.
@SpookyJanelle Good choice. But be careful -- that movie can cause blindness and/or death. #hobgoblins #mst3k

Oh man, just when I think it can't get any worse, MST3K finds another movie even worse than the last. 'Hobgoblins' this time.
Tonight's Bad Movie Night Triple Feature: "Hobgoblins", "The Beast of Yucca Flats", and "Glen or Glenda?"
@wtfitskatie Hahah, yeah pretty much. OHHH!!! Here's a better clip of MST3K to watch. This is from the movie 'Hobgoblins'. So good.
Pretty sure I need to call the I just watched the movie hobgoblins crisis phoneline..
Also, one of the guys' rooms has a poster for the first Hobgoblins movie in it. This is intentionally bad and all, but...what the hell?
Finally sitting down to watch one of the most important movie sequels of our time - Hobgoblins 2.
Happy birthday to Duane Whitaker, who played the loveable, huggable Roadrash in MST3K movie "Hobgoblins."
Just watched the #MST3K rip apart "Hobgoblins." It is without a doubt, the WORST movie ever made. Not even close.
My favorite horrible "horror" movie is Hobgoblins. Go watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. =)
"hobgoblins and witches and things that go bump in the night"- a quote from "the satanic rites of dracula' --i'm fucking loving this movie!
MST3K is awesome. Watched Hobgoblins and now Manos: The Hands of Fate. The latter isn't even what you could call a movie.
May 7th Cineprov! is mocking Hobgoblins 2. Its the least we can do since someone gave Rick Sloane money to make another Hobgoblins movie
@bobservo Failed Hobgoblins reference, sorry! Should have attributed. (Then later post "31!" for when the movie shows parking yet again.)

@sball500 hobgoblins is so bad the car took its own life to get out of that movie
“Someone’s rubbing puppets on us!” RT @tstasik Yay! Just saw the MST3K version of Hobgoblins. What a bad movie! Full of yuks!
Just watched Hobgoblins. Fantastic movie. Great fight scenes and excellent realistic explosions are this movies forte. Would Recommend!
@Scott_WhiteAhh Sequel to Hobgoblins, the stupidest movie Mystery Science Theater ever did. I couldn't believe it.
On @BillCorbett's bday, crows gather around the movie studio where they shot Hobgoblins. #BillCorbettBdayMyths
@Psycho_Ex_Movie I've heard of that one - can't remember if I ever saw it. I've suffered from severe memory loss ever since Hobgoblins
Your movie is called...HOBGOBLINS!

The acting in this movie reminds me of Hobgoblins #synthnine ~ Come watch and chat with me! http://justin.tv/s/04/ofIOzhw/synthnine
@investaawesome This Hobgoblins movie doesn't make any sense!
@MJOffen The Hobgoblins are by FAR the most pleasant part of the movie. The "actors" are terrifying for the diseases they must be carrying
@gidgetwidget Rick Sloane directed the MST3K movie, Hobgoblins. In the ep, the bots make up Rick Sloane quotes, and we're continuing the fun
@NicLewis @Professor_Snack "Hobgoblins was going to be a silent movie, but then I found the mic plug." -Rick Sloane
Movie Time!! Beer and MST3000-Hobgoblins with @Brandon_bell. Come laugh with us.
He's turning in to the old guy from the movie Hobgoblins.
RT @mocoddle: @NicLewis "I made the movie Hobgoblins after reading Leviathan." -Rick Sloane // Now that one, I believe. :)
RT @mocoddle "Oh, cripes. We're gonna watch Hobgoblins, #MST3K now." I think that might be the *worst* movie the SOL crew ever had to watch.
Movie Nine Miles Down and Hobgoblins 2 http://ur.ly/3Qai?fa4u:#love
Me @zachlogan901 and @leshalogan are watching the worst movie of all time...literally. Hobgoblins 2....there are no words how terrible it is
@cgutteridge There is - imaginatively titled "Hobgoblins 2". Which I have to get around to ordering as a present for a bad movie lover.
Watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 and their take on the movie "Hobgoblins". Oh homework, how I dread you.

@scottsmitty #hobgoblins "scram, its the owner of the house, we'll have to shoot the movie else where."
Awesome time at LVP! Then, MST3K with the family over cheesesteaks. Hobgoblins may be the worst MST movie evar.
Just watched mst3000 hobgoblins. It was such a bad movie thatthemst3k crew couldn't help it. #fb
and the emcee from hobgoblins is JJJ? man is watching THAT movie going to be weird form now on.
(@justinbsane) HOBGOBLINS ruled. But will we watch CHATTERBOX, the singing vagina movie, tonight? The decision has not yet been made.
HOBGOBLINS is so far a Bad Movie Night classic. We even started spontaneously dancing like the characters. I did the nerd's Egyptian moves.
Had an awesome meet-up with my fellow GQMFs! Had green-blooded hobgoblins & watched the ST movie through slash-goggles #dragoncon
@itwasadaiyespa you mean the movie hobgoblins? didn't mst3k do a show on that?
So, movie is done. I suddenly have the urge to watch the relatively amazing "Hobgoblins"...
watching IMDB's #58 worst movie (Boggy Creek #) saw #27 this morning (Hobgoblins)
finally got around to watching hobgoblins 2, and wow, just an awful awfully entertaining movie. cant wait to watch w/ directors commentary
@mikeyway i would have to say that troll 2 is by far worse. it had ZERO to do with trolls. you want a bad movie.. try hobgoblins... horrid..
While I draw, a movie about Hobgoblins is playing. A guy and some robots keep talking during it.

@danadangerrr Hehehe. The movie is on cable. Most of my DVDs are at my apartment. Otherwise I would totally put in Hobgoblins in now. XD
is watching the cheesiest movie on Mystery Science Theater...Hobgoblins....hysterical!
So I read the Wiki article on Hobgoblins (1987) and I'm happy to find out the movie's bad on purpose.
@michaeljnelson Remember when you and the robots watched Hobgoblins and it was just a terrible, terrible movie? That was awesome!
Today's favorite movie: DRACULA A.D. 1972 (1972). "Weird, man. Way out. I mean, spooks, hobgoblins, black magic. All that sort of stuff!"
Watching a horrible movie as presented by MST3K - Hobgoblins. Seriously, I think drugs would make this better. Haha.

Don't know if it's ok to use racial slurs when they're directed at a race that doesn't exist. Movie coined phrase "greenblooded hobgoblins."
I find it hard nay impossible, @clastowka that a movie can be worse than Twilight and I've seen Hobgoblins,Manos, &The Wild World of Batwoman
Just bought "Blood Theater" (aka Movie House Massacre) after reading up on Rick Sloane (directer of "Hobgoblins I & II"). Looks terribly rad
@miz_missy "Hobgoblins" is the only MST ep I have a hard time watching because the movie is just so repulsive.
Oh my god; there's a sequel to "Hobgoblins"! The horrible movie possibilities! I MUST SEE THIS. http://tinyurl.com/clubscum
just got home from hutch's roads wernt tooo bad. Watched some classic MST3k ... Hobgoblins has to be the worst movie I have ever seen !
@jetsers No you want Hobgoblins. It's in a MST3k box set. It's got a fight involving a rake. It's hands down the worst movie I've ever seen.
