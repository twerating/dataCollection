Kyle is bored with the hype about Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Tome is very excited to see guest Vanilla Ice in his movie Cool as Ice.

"Cool as Ice" (1991) is a monstrous waste of time of a movie (F) #ConamaraViews <nyfhe2>

"Cool As Ice" will always be my favorite movie
@vanillaice can we have the movie cool as ice part 2 from Mr ice himself
“I dont sweat it under pressure, cos I’m cool as ice.” Nice one Vanilla, referring to your own movie AND your flagrant plagiarism.
When is @DIRECTV gonna play that 'Cool As Ice' movie again? I haven't seen it in years.
The five best movies ever made are: 1. The Room 2. Troll 2 3. The Garbage Pail Kids Movie 4. Birdemic: Shock and Terror 5. Cool as Ice
Cool as Ice is the only movie where I root for a nuclear holocaust to wipe out every character.
@robotfriday @ianmcginty @RiffTrax It's also a shout out to @vanillaice! Cool As Ice was his movie he did in the 90's! :)

@vanillaice yep yep "cool as ice" best movie eveeer
@vanillaice i just got my favorite movie ever! Cool as ice <3.
As I had stated a few days ago, COOL AS ICE technically made more money than the new JEM movie, although not by much https://twitter.com/Dart_Adams/status/660559017161289728 …
But, I guess every movie that isn't Ninja Turtles II or Cool as Ice are lessened by a lack of Vanilla Ice #dustinwatchesmovies
@vanillaice I have your movie COOL as ICE pic.twitter.com/FlWuzCCrR6
@vanillaice Watching #VanillaIceProject. Built amazing movie theater. I see you bro. With that Cool As Ice poster... Love that movie.
"Whackhead was trying to play baseball with my homeboys bike!" -Vanilla Ice in "Cool as Ice" a movie about Vanilla Ice
If we use an inflation calculator, $1.1M in 1991 would be close to $2M today. This means COOL AS ICE is more successful than the JEM movie.
Technically, Vanilla Ice's movie COOL AS ICE made $1.1M, with theaters replacing it before the full week. JEM is that bad.
@RealKidPoker best movie shawshank. Worst movie by far cool as ice featuring vanilla ice.
To this Day Cool as Ice is my favorite movie
@raysofCINEMA cinematographer also worked on Cool as Ice. A vanillia ice film. Now does every Spielberg movie. Anything is possible
Cool As Ice is most likely the worst movie I ever watched for 10 minutes then was forced to drink battery acid.

Holy crap! Rifftrax wasn't joking. The cinematographer on Cool as Ice (the Vanilla Ice movie) was also cinematographer on Schindler's List.
@aegies Whoa the DP of the Vanilla Ice movie "Cool as Ice" worked on The Judge?!
Started watching Cool as Ice. I'm going to base all social rules off of THIS movie.
"Cool as Ice" should be weaponized and dropped onto ISIS. It's everything a movie from the '90s starring Vanilla Ice should be, only worse.
Vanilla Ice's restoration show is on at the same time as his movie Cool as Ice. I'm pretty sure there's a black hole in the universe.
Cool as Ice, starring @vanillaice. How did I not ever know this movie existed until right now??
'Cool As Ice' is on tv and I can't stop watching this train wreck of a movie. #howdidthisgetmade #vanillaice

The intro to the Cool As Ice movie is still my second favourite film intro, second only to Casino Royale http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZzgCS1Kn_M … #risky
GOOD GRAVY I loved COOL AS ICE even more in 35mm. Movie was like breakdancing through the dreams of a young Michael Bay and it's glorious.
The only movie that even comes close to having a comparable "crashing a teen dance" moment to COOL AS ICE is Aunt Becky bmx-dancing in RAD.
Highlight of married life so far: my husband turning to me during the movie and saying earnestly, "I think you're cool as ice."
Vanilla Ice dated Madonna at time of the movie Cool As Ice- Gwyneth Paltrow was also almost cast in it.Vanilla's Posse Names: Truck & Psuedo

My best moment of this week was remember the movie ‘Cool As Ice’ exists. I’m not sure what that says about me.
COOL AS ICE in particular is so good. I remember showing a room full of 12 people that movie unsuspectingly. Half left. Sucks for them.
@cinefamily is screening Cool As Ice at the end of the month. Never saw the movie, but I will admit that I read the novelization as a child.
In "Cool as Ice", Vanilla Ice asks his love interest "what's it like to have parents?" Again, why is this movie not issued to you at birth?
Why is this the first time I'm watching the movie "Cool as Ice" starring Vanilla Ice!?!? #Oscars
"cool as ice" starring vanilla ice is the best worst movie ever. i highly recommend it.
Cool as ice best movie ever.

As much as it pains me to say it, Cool As Ice is the movie that most accurately captures the experience of living in the early ‘90s.
Vanilla Ice when he was youngg was madd coolz maan. Espcially in the movie Cool As Ice. >
Truthful Tuesday: I wanted to ride on that motorcycle with Vanilla Ice in the 1991 movie Cool As Ice! Drop the zero and get with a hero!

@Kellie_Martin I enjoyed the Mystery Woman marathon on Hallmark Movie Channel today. Philby is cool as ice. Good stuff. @hallmarkchannel
In the last ten days I have seen three refrences to the movie "Cool as Ice". I'm still not going to watch it.
Watching/listening to the @RiffTrax of Vanilla Ice's COOL AS ICE. They're right-it is, empirically, the most 90s movie that was ever made.
@briancloar, @joey_repulsive and I are only a few minutes into Cool as Ice, and I think it might be the greatest movie ever. #CoolAsIce
@GiantComedy - Forget going to see a movie. Go check out the @RiffTrax latest riff of "Cool as Ice". #YoWordYepYep

a clip from COOL AS ICE, the movie that defined a generation. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ElAIqSBTKc … Let me just blow my brains out...
Just finished @RiffTrax “Cool as Ice” w/ @NotRelatedProd crew. That movie was almost as bad as Twilight. I can’t believe I just said that.
According to the amount of seeders Rifftrax's most pirated movie audio thing is Cool As Ice, in front of The Avengers by 34 d/ls.
I did the opposite of watching the Oscars. I watched Cool As Ice, the Vanilla Ice movie. Because I make good decisions.
@vanillaice Cool as Ice is my favourite movie. Fo' Reals. That part with the motorcycle and the dancing in the desert is dope! #coolasice

Bit of trivia: Janusz Kaminski, nominated for best Cinematography for Lincoln, also did the Vanilla Ice movie, Cool As Ice.
The Rifftrax version of "Cool As Ice" is pretty amaz-balls. This movie is an unbelievable absurdist farce... The 90's vomited all over it.
@paulscheer Please do the Vanilla Ice 1991 movie classic "Cool As Ice." So worth it. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101615/ …

Fun Fact: Janusz Kamiński, Oscar-winning cinematographer of Schindler’s List, also worked on the 1991 Vanilla Ice movie Cool As Ice.
i'm cracking up at "cool as ice" @rifftrax but honestly i would be cracking up at the movie almost as much even without the commentary
The @RiffTrax crew's latest target was @vanillaice's Cool as Ice. So I had to update my bad movie bucket list: http://www.jason-montgomery.com/blog/2013/2/23/expanding-horizons-iv-the-quickening …
I just sat through the Cool as Ice #Rifftrax. Yep, the Vanilla Ice movie. Yes, the movie is ass.
Time to check out the @RiffTrax of Cool As Ice, a movie I skipped back in elementary school... Let's see if I made the right choice.
Just watched Cool as Ice for the first time ever, what a horrible movie, fortunately I had Rifftrax.
Whenever I see a really bad @RiffTrax movie like Cool As Ice I pray Tommy Wiseau will wander through a scene in an ill fitting suit.
So I just found out that Vanilla Ice made a movie called "Cool As Ice." I am really fighting the urge to buy it right now. I may need help.
Watching Cool As Ice! probably best movie ever made? #rifftrax
Fun fact: Cool as Ice (the Vanilla Ice movie) has the same cinematographer as Schindler's List.
Cool as Ice is the hardest movie I've ever had to watch. Is this what meth withdrawal is like? @RiffTrax
"Cool As Ice" on Rifftrax. Wow. Possibly the worst movie ever.
I may be guilty of using "Cool as Ice" as a snuggly couch date movie BUT IT'S OKAY it was the @RiffTrax version. http://www.rifftrax.com/vod/cool-as-ice 
Wait. Ice Ice Baby ISN'T in Cool as Ice?! Were we already tired of his one song by the time we gave him a movie?

The Rifftrax take on Cool as Ice is great, as expected, but... that movie... it's not that it's bad (it is), I just don't know what it is.
Cover me, I'm going into the #Rifftrax of the Vanilla Ice movie Cool As Ice. Feel like I should be drinking Zima.
30 seconds into Cool as Ice and I'n reminded how magically bad this movie is.
Bought the RiffTrax VOD of Cool as Ice. I'm sure it'll be funny, but I can't help feeling dirty spending money on a Vanilla Ice movie.

I sat up watching Cool As Ice, Vanilla Ice's movie. It's exactly as bad and a waste of time as it sounds.
We're watching Dracula 3000 and damn is this movie bad. Vampire Coolio is pretty hilarious though. It's on par with Cool As Ice.
Currently watching Cool as Ice... a Vanilla Ice movie from the early 90s... it's ridiculous.
