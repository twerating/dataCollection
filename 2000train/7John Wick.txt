watching john wick for first time. i'm sure cool movie is coming but 'dead wife backstory' instantly takes any movie to a lower level.
John Wick is the most unexpected badass movie

Looking at John Wick I think Keanu Reeves could make a good Solid Snake in an MGS movie.
Tonight's movie: 'John Wick'
John Wick is my movie , Keanu Reeves has & always will be my favorite actor . I just love him in everything .
I loved your movie John wick by the way but you are just in the movies !! This is real my friend !!! I am going to give you real guns
John wick is a sick movie
John Wick is the baddest motherfucker in any movie ever, can't convince me otherwise
John Wick may be the best action movie I've ever seen
John Wick is a bad ass movie
What's the best movie of all time? Wrong, the correct answer is John Wick.
I would say John Wick is my favorite action movie because some guy goes ape shit crazy for revenge because someone killed his puppy
Watching John Wick right now... @rboulding, why didn't you tell me that Vladimir Putin was in this movie? Haha.
John Wick has already become a classic for me. Seen it at least 10 times. Best action movie I've seen in years. #Movies #BadAss
John Wick My Movie. It Goes So Hard. I Have Yet To See A Better Action Movie Than This.

What made John Wick so fire was that I had no idea what the movie was about ...watched it on the humble and he SPAZZED.
"Edge of Tomorrow" was good and "John Wick" was great. Maybe Vin Diesel can make a good witch hunter movie? #crazierthings

This is my 3rd time starting John Wick over lmao . I can not grasp what this movie is truly about yet to save my life

I love the movie John Wick.
John Wick is a pretty dope movie, I've watched this countless times.

Captain America and John Wick team up with Dr. Gregory House to take down Edi Amin and his pal Bob Sugar and this movie wasn't a hit?
It's hard not to see every Keanu movie as a John Wick prequel. #StreetKings
John Wick was a fantastic action movie, but failed Bechdel test miserably, of course. It would have been really nice to see Perkins survive.

My last 2 tweets is about the movie "John Wick" (2014). Played by Keanu Reeves. Simply awesome, if you're into assassins-flicks.
John Wick is a better Hitman movie than the two actual Hitman films. John Wick is such a sick film.
The is a Movie called "John Wick" don't sleep on it, a must watch
John Wick is the best action movie ever made. Don't fight me on this subject.
I've watched John Wick like 7 times in the last week. And I'm currently watching it. Such a Good movie!
I half expect a scene of John Wick putting up wallpaper. Half this movie is people doing mechanical work to a song.
I think Zack Snyder's unit or John Wick directors should be the 2nd unit for The Flash movie... That would be dope!
FYI, JOHN WICK is a great Halloween movie. Christmas too.
@YGNeodev I saw the original movie in theaters the day i got my heart shitted on. It made that day so much better. john wick is my life

Of course now that I saw the movie, I have to run John Wick for a little bit in Payday. pic.twitter.com/QE0XgaKIlU
The choreography of the movie was really good too. Being an action movie, I hope this would be John Wick's strong point...and it is.

John wick is a badass movie. Every time it's on I gotta watch it
My favorite movie: John Wick
John Wick has become one of those movies I have to see whenever I notice it's on lol. No matter where in the movie I catch it, I watch.
When they killed his dog in the movie John Wick <<<<<
John Wick not the best movie but I can watch it. He catch 120 bodies easy in that flick. My god.
Speed, Point Break, The Matrix, John Wick, Street Kings, The Replacements, Hardball. Some good cable movie staples right there.
The movie John Wick is straight about business no jokey jokey
John Wick is so underrated it's such a good movie though.

John Wick is that movie
I had very low expectations for John Wick, it is after all a revenge movie about a murdered dog, but it was superb. A brilliant action movie
Just watched John Wick the movie, totally recommend it and Keanu Reeves

@itsTiimothy he's good in th first matrix movie and John wick that's it
I really like the movie john wick and I feel dumb when people are like "what's it about?"
So John Wick is a pretty epic movie. Keanu Reeves brings it real good.
John Wick is like Taken but with 'cute dog' instead of 'dumb girl who can't function without a man' and the movie is 'good' instead of 'bad'
John Wick is an objectively perfect movie. pic.twitter.com/jkEN2LxT2X
So I finally saw the movie John wick lol I see what migos was talm bout on that song now!
Is John Wick a good movie or is it just bad? I'm not getting what the actual verdict is on that movie

John Wick was a badass movie. Throughly enjoyed it. $$$$
N the spot watching John Wick...this movie popping
John Wick, no me canso de verla. Best action movie
The fight scene in the rain at the end of John Wick is how the 3rd Matrix movie fight scene in the rain should have ended.

The whole movie is John Wick getting revenge for his puppy’s murder. The best reason for total annihilation tbh.
Watching John Wick. Literally a movie about a guy who defeats the Russian mob because they kill his dog. I love it.

"Mad Max game is terrible cause he's just trying to get his car back!" John Wick is a movie where he kills the mob for his dog. #GamerGate
@TheScudStud Theon's the ONLY guy in the whole movie who doesn't know exactly who John Wick is. Its amazing.
John Wick kills everyone and then takes home a blue nose pit bull puppy... Greatest movie ever
John Wick is a damn good movie.
John wick is a movie where the main character seeks vengeance for the death of his dead Dog
Watching the movie john wick makes me wanna become an assassin. The gun control in this movie makes me drool
John Wick doesn't kill anyone until 29:26. Thinking he kills someone for every minute of the rest of the movie, doe.
@JordySloan John Wick. A surprisingly good action movie. One of the best action movies of recent times IMO that is not a super hero flick
“May I ask why you struck my son?” “He stole John Wick’s car and killed his dog.” “Oh.” I love this movie.
Watching John Wick with my best friends. This movie is so much fun.
With Fury Road, The Raid movies, Kingsman and John Wick, I hope the new Jason Bourne movie realizes people don't want shaky cam anymore.
John Wick was a good movie bout to find another one #lastdayoff #movieday

John Wick is a pretty cool movie.
Is John Wick not a good movie? I've tried to watch both at least twice but every time I get distracted.
The movie John Wick is really good. But it does have a lot of blood and people being shot in the head that they actually show. Just warning
Have you guys ever watched John Wick? that movie is straight savage

John Wick is by no means a perfect movie, but I have lots of time for new approaches to action movies.
I rarely praise Keanu Reeves vehicles that aren't BILL & TED but JOHN WICK is a pretty fine action movie.
John wick is a bad ass movie
and as such, does a tremendous job making the movie about the action. Also, John Wick was a surprisingly charming character in his own way.

John Wick is Keanu Reeves best movie. #VMAs
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/VnPagmeLm-g?a  John Wick Movie CLIP - Bar Fight (2014) - Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe
@danny_lessley The movie John Wick was terrific Many reviewers saying; Keanu is back. He says in the movie, "Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back."
For all of the amazing action scenes in JOHN WICK, it's the little moments and character beats that make me love that movie more and more.
Hold up, what about this movie John Wick? Anyone seen that?
the only movie in 2014 I remember at all is john wick and it was pretty good
John Wick is a film that understands exactly what the audience wants in an action movie

#FantasyFilmFest2015 Momentum - A lady action hero movie - good (best flick so far - I like it more than John Wick) Purefoy's performance
John Wick is a pretty good movie
@hornyladki can't agree more. John wick is Tamil movie with out songs. And avatar is Hindi movie without songs IMO #Masala
My Sunday night movie: John Wick (2014). It's a long time since I've sat down to a Keanu film #sundaymovie
Man. This movie is awesome. Better than "John Wick" (which was pretty much a Tamil flick in spirit) I would say.
Up watching John wick that movie the truth
Watching John Wick, or, the movie where an overreaction over a car became an overreaction over a dog
Have to admit, some things John Wick did in the movie was pretty boss. A few scenes made me chuckle.
John Wick is the most incredible, asinine movie that I have seen. #KeanuFTW
It's been a long time since I've seen anything as good as John Wick. About as perfect as an action movie can get
Restarting a movie I was already an hour into because I fell asleep at some point. My new John Wick. The lullaby movies
