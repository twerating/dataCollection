Has any movie put a child in as much danger as 10 year old Anakin in PHANTOM MENACE? No wonder the kid grew up to be a psycho freak.

@alexdjade6 like the movie with the psycho roommate?
Watch "American psycho" on Netflix.. It's my favorite movie of all time
@Sparky916 I've never seen Psycho I have the book. I wanted to read it before I saw the movie
When I'm done watching Psycho-Pass (the movie) I'll be done watching the whole thing .__.
the only christian bale movie ive watched was american psycho so when i see him in a movie i think thats what it is but it's always batman
Months later, my fave part of the Psycho-Pass movie is when ginoza punches kogami
Who else thinks that they should make a horror movie where Santa is a deranged perverted psycho who eats kids?
Craziest book I've ever read was American Psycho. I read it like 2 or 3 summers ago. INSANE. Read that. Eff the movie, it's good but read it
Why does every movie try and act out the 'Psycho' shower scene whenever somebody goes in the shower??? It's so overdone.

I love this lifetime movie but this nanny's a psycho!
The thing about lifetime is that you think you're just watching a movie and at the end you find out how much time the psycho got in jail
I will never watch horror psycho movie again.
@1999TWICE @yurrakims it's a psycho movie, so it will be no ghost yey~

American Psycho is a good movie. A lot beneath surface if you care to look. And a ton of great dialogue (which apparently is all from novel)
Leave it to me to yell like a psycho during a movie and make the people beside me laugh...

Love the movie the boy next door because Ryan Guzman is the love of my life even if he's psycho in the movie
I recomend the movie American Psycho. It does have killing in it and sexual themes but who cares the main person is Christian Bale
American psycho and clueless: classic movie marathon essentials.

There's a song in the soundtrack to the movie Finding Nemo named psycho (the murderer) Don't ask me how I know.
It's definitely my favorite straight up comedy movie though, so why not. American Psycho is comedy of course, but a very different kind.
can't they ever make a gay movie where it's like kinda normal and no one has to like be psycho or fucked up or attempt murder?!
Honestly I think the movie for American psycho is the only time where the movie is better than the book.
How is #CorpseBride in the 'Scary Movies' section...? A child's movie next to American Psycho.
Can't tell if I'm watching a "they're already dead" or "he thinks it's a haunting but he's a psycho killer" type movie.

Finally going to watch the Psycho Pass movie. CAN'T wait for Gino's ponytail tbh.
Bottom line American Psycho is not a movie for everybody at all, but if you're someone who calls it stupid then here's why..
That movie really od good. She got that psycho loyalty https://twitter.com/funnyjulius/status/667435315506884609 …
@athenahollow considering he's not Murican, is it supposed to be a play on American Psycho? A movie about a misogynist's killing spree?
The Huntsman Winter's War Movie Trailer https://youtu.be/-nOumGL3sgQ  via @YouTube Ok who doesn't like two ice cold psycho beauties & axes.
"Knock knock" is a psycho ass movie. Wtf is this? people like to call themselves crazy abazi
Watching American psycho, a light, feel good morning movie
It would be really, really nice if there's a live action movie/drama of Psycho-Pass.
So done with the Psycho-Pass Movie :)))
Psycho is a fuuurrreaky movie

@Gayer_Than_Thou that's how I feel about American Psycho. Luckily the movie is shite.
American Psycho is a messed up movie!!!
Every guy named "Kevin" in every movie ever is either a psycho or a loser. So yes, I do know a thing or two about oppression
American psycho was such an unpleasant movie.
falling asleep to the movie 'Gabriel' w Rory Culkin bc it turns me on how psycho he is about this girl in the movie lmao
psycho intense like quality movie but I hid my eyes in 80%. It's one of those movies that stick in ur head tho #hungergamesmockingjaypart2
I'm still tryna find the right way to approach "netflix & chill" (or, as it was once called, "movie night") w/ an American Psycho suggestion
that's a lie. i actually think, "wow, my life is a movie. that movie is Psycho, and this is where i die, stabbed to death in this shower."
So I have to redesign movie posters in GS3 for American Psycho and (wait for it)...Napoleon Dynamite

I'm getting really sick of supernatural horror movies. Give me a good old-fashioned psycho killer movie, please.

If you're in a scary movie never turn your back on the psycho killer! I don't care if you already shot and stabbed him!
Someone should remake this movie w/ new actors and colorize it. HAHA! No. No, that's a terrible idea. #Psycho
