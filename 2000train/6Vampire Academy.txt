Vampire Academy Movie Review http://wp.me/p5DKsa-Dv  via @GarnetNGold22
10.) Vampire Academy is the worst book to movie adaptation I've ever seen.
vampire academy deserved so much better than that horrible movie adaptation.
I started watching Vampire Academy and the first song that played is Bad Girls by M.I.A, I love this movie already
Ok don't stone me to death but vampire academy deserves another shot at a movie/tv series
Today I watched the Vampire Academy movie and I'm disappointed bc the books are so much better
ok but are we not gonna talk about the guys in the movie Vampire Academy???? I'm feeling more straight than a homophobic Christian
watching the vampire academy movie this morning!!! check out @VATOUFS everyone bc i'm incredibly excited!!
Watching vampire academy I love this movie the girl is such a savage
Rewatching the Vampire Academy movie since I've now read the books. Royalty always requires inexplicable British accents.
Well can't study now... the vampire academy movie is now on Netflix
I'm watching this movie called vampire academy and the dialog is overwritten already 5 minuets in
Okay so Vampire Academy is such a terrible movie. Which is too bad because the book series is so good.
@erm_2000 yes, it's a movie called "vampire academy" :)
Finally film-watched Vampire Academy, it was actually good. Another movie checked off my 'to watch list'.
Oh no. They put Vampire Academy on netflix, now I have to watch it. I LOVED the books but the movie looks so bad.

@OliverBooks your tweets about Vampire Academy movie... Right in the feelings
Torn between watching a critically acclaimed film I've never seen and Vampire Academy, cause damn that movie has a special place in my heart
Vampire Academy is on Netflix now. This is gonna be my breaking point. I absolutely adore the books, but I have little hope for the movie.
Watching the movie Vampire Academy, based on a book I've been wanting to read. Pretty good so far, go watch it.
vampire academy was a good movie 10/10 I recommend

Vampire academy. Awesome movie
currently reading Vampire Academy and just realized how the movie adaptation was far different from the book , ugh.
In all honesty, the movie is pretty decent. So so much better than the crappy Vampire Academy. Dom was handsome there of course.

I need a Vampire Academy 2. Idfc if it did bad in the box office. They can't just start a franchise and end it with the first movie.

just realised the guy who played christian ozera in the vampire academy movie adaptation is also the guy in taylor swift's style music video
There's too many hot guys in vampire academy even though the movie sucks
I loved the Vampire Academy books and the movie is pretty good, too. And so much better than Twilight.
I’m sad the Vampire Academy movie franchise bombed but it makes me happy to see the actors still around in other projects
I'm still so mad about how terrible the Vampire Academy movie was.
Oh btw, I watched The Vampire Academy movie last night and..

Vampire Academy was such an underrated movie, trailer totally undermined it because I totally loved it! I hope they make the sequel
I just watched Vampire Academy and I must say that the books are a lot better than the movie
I just watched the movie "the vampire academy" after I read the books almost a year ago
@EliMarietweets omg yes! Have you seen Vampire Academy the movie? He's in that!

@batoolreads he was in vampire academy movie BUT YAH IF DOM HAD LIGHTER HAIR
Boy in Taylor Swift video is in Vampire Academy movie. Life is good.
THE GUY IN THE STYLE MV IS DOMINIC SHERWOOD FROM THE VAMPIRE ACADEMY MOVIE I KNEW IT WAS HIM
Was the guy in the new Taylor Swift video, Christian in the Vampire Academy movie?
I SWEAR TO GOD THE GUY IN THE NEW TAYLOR SWIFT VIDEO IS THE GUY WHO PLAYED CHRISTIAN IN THE VAMPIRE ACADEMY MOVIE
I KNEW IT I FELT IT IN MY BONESS DOM SHERWOOD WAS MEANT FOR SOMETHING THAT BIGGG I LOve him in that Vampire Academy movie
They just need to take it more seriously and promote it correctly. Vampire Academy wasn't a bad movie but it could've been so much better
oh he portrayed Christian Ozera in the movie Vampire Academy
Ah Dominic Showroom, he played Christian in the Vampire Academy movie that I have not seen yet however I throughly enjoyed the books
I KNEW IT WAS @DomSherwood1 He was in Vampire Academy movie

Still mad I paid like $12 to see the vampire academy and the whole movie I was Kylie Jenner eye rolling
has anyone seen vampire academy cos I have an unhealthy love for that movie
Didn't think there could be a worse vampire movie then twilight, then I watched vampire academy
Since I did actually read all the books I'm gonna see if the Vampire Academy movie is any good.
in the vampire academy movie when dimitri took off his shirt and rose said "sweet sassy mollassey" I almost puked it was so dumb

Sometimes a faithful adaptation doesn't grant a good movie. A good film lies in the making of it. Examples: Twilight and Vampire Academy

No matter what the critics said about this movie. Vampire Academy is AMAZING! my favorite characters… http://instagram.com/p/xW_7jFowo3/ 
Zoey Deutch really looks like Acacia in the Vampire Academy movie tf
They should've made Vampire Academy into a TV series rather than a movie.. They left too much out and modified way too many things.
i'd love to see the vampire academy on the big screen, at least they must do the frostbite movie and make it better than the first one
I've never read any of the Vampire Academy books, but the movie looks somewhat promising so far
