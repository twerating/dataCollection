"Prisoners" is a excellent movie. Hats off to gyllenhall and jackman on that one
maybe its just me but somehow the tribals episode in akhil movie trailer reminds me of tintin's "prisoners of sun" story
If you've never seen seen Prisoners go watch it ! It's a great movie !
okay but Prisoners is a perfect movie
Holy crap, I know I'm late with this, but I just watched Prisoners and it was phenomenal. My heart was pounding throughout the whole movie.

Prisoners is a really strong movie. It's also a profoundly weird thing to watch at 7AM on a Sunday.

Prisoners is such a good movie.
Prisoners was the best movie of 2013. It’s like 3 hours long, but I can watch it over and over again.

@jrnnynrlson most recently I very emphatically said the movie prisoners (starring jake gyllenhaal) came out on Christmas Day. it didn't
Never have I seen a movie like "Prisoners" before. slow clap. Damn!
Took the night off to watch a movie that really stressed me out. Thanks Jake Gyllenhaal. #prisoners
Wow! Prisoners was a great movie! Once again, and to no surprise, Jake Gyllenhaal delivers an incredible performance, as does Hugh Jackman

#prisoners an amazing movie, @JakeGyllenhal is awesome.
Am I the only one that thinks the @steelers throw back uniforms make them look like prisoners from a #CohenBrothers movie?

Watched both The Prisoners and Man up last night. Comparing the script and movie together. Some parts were wrong or omitted out.
Ok...new future movie to latch on to...Demolition Man. Behind already because we dont freeze prisoners yet but that was 2032. 17 years away?
Prisoners is a very good movie
Of course, as prisoners of war in Dresden, tough talk and all that, stuff that would make a nifty war movie.

@BBW_BFF I am a fan of Prisoners but never saw it in theaters because of the trailer waiting so long on that movie is definitely a regret
So we were watching this movie, the prisoners were being evacuated, Aaron asked me "are they bad guys?" And i answered "they are prisoners".

@JacobSetser prisoners is bomb. I liked it more than I thought I would. Did you see that director's new movie? Sicario??
Watched the movie Prisoners. It was like watching a long Criminal Minds episode. I pegged the killer by the character's second appearance.
like the movie prisoners
I really wanna watch prisoners again legit my favorite movie. I'm obsessed
Do those prisoners who beat the Harvard debate team get a cut from the movie rights?
Was wanting to watch a movie like Prisoners for a long long time, and Sicario made that happen. Incidentally, same director.
I watched the movie "Prisoners" starring @RealHughJackman ★★★1/2 My review: http://letterboxd.com/tokyo5/film/prisoners/ …
"Prisoners" Starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Two perfect actors. Im looking forward for the part 2. :) what a masterpiece movie :)
Just watched the movie Prisoners
#Sicario takes a while to develop, but the result is great. Definitely not Villenueve's best movie (Prisoners), worth a shot though. 8.75/10
I bet the Harvard debate team that lost to the African Americans in that Denzel movie are low key happy about this loss to the prisoners
I liked a @YouTube video from @davidgc77 http://youtu.be/vG373ycJoSk?a  Prisoners Of The Lost Universe (Full Movie) 1980's Sci-Fi Film
Can we have a feel-good, Might Duckesque movie about those prisoners schooling the Harvard Debate team? It'd be really sweet!
I posted 7 photos on Facebook in the album "(Prisoners ) movie 2013" http://fb.me/7KYSZdmlW 
Denis Villeneuve made yet another great movie. If you liked Prisoners or No Country for Old Men you'll like Sicario
I doubt it would hold as a movie of the year, even in the top 15s like Prisoners had years prior. It was a good follow up piece otherwise.
Less intense (if tense at all) but more action that its predecessor Prisoners. As for the movie over all, Sicario was quite good.
Is the "prisoners debate team beats Harvard" movie in post-production yet? http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/08/bard-debate-prison-team-beat-harvards-heres-how-we-did-it …
@Steele131 Prisoners was tense throughout the entire movie. Sicario only had glimpses of tenseness
Actually the best movie of the year, I loved prisoners (another movie by the director) but this is WAY WAY better. https://twitter.com/ryboyellis/status/651984819857960960 …
Boom! They're some sort of child abducting cult! Like in the movie Prisoners! Damn American Horror Story, I'm catching on to you!
A great story. Who has the movie rights? Why you shouldn’t be surprised that prisoners crushed Harvard’s debate team http://wapo.st/1Lkx7CP 
- https://youtu.be/sfRckdHq--c  #Prisoners This movie puts of grave questions.Very hard.Played H.Jackman ,http://J.Gyllenhaal.To  see absolutely.
Someone should make a Mighty Ducks type of movie about the prisoners who beat the Harvard debate team.
@circusthuppaki sicario is better than prisoners imo. But innaritu fellow movie innum varala. Paapom

Prisoners was such a sick movie, pretty excited to see how Villanueve does with Sicario.
If I wrote a movie adaptation of Ransom by Lois Duncan I'd want Dennis Villeneuve to direct and for it to feel dark & gritty à la Prisoners.
I don't mind if YOU liked the movie PRISONERS, just don't ever approach me or talk to me about anything.
Watching the movie "prisoners" gotta say it's a pretty fucked up movie
@MovieBuffNtn totally different movie, but anyone that loves Prisoners should love Sicario let me know once you see it!

I mean is this from a movie or what? Hungarian prisoners building fence along Serbian border. #SyriaCrisis pic.twitter.com/3jIJNewTto
Saw the movie Prisoners really well-made film keeps you guessing throughout
So, are we going to retrospectively agree that PRISONERS was a good movie? Because I'd be okay with that.
#Prisoners is the perfect crime/mystery/drama movie. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal can't do no wrong My cup of tea or coffee in my case.
@officialDannyT haven't seen the movie, but I'm sure that you kicked the shit out the other prisoners #TrejoPower
Prisoners was such a good movie I just didn't like the ending. But overall it was good af and I figured it out before the end of it

They got powers then became prisoners of the government the whole movie like who the hell wants to see that. Glad I aint pay my money for it

Prisoners is the craziest movie
I've been trying to finish watching the movie prisoners for probably over a year & I still have not gotten the chance
don't ever watch prisoners worst movie ever
Prisoners is such a good movie, although the way it ends upsets me.
Yo prisoners is the top 3 greatest movie ever made
prisoners is the weirdest most confusing movie ever
Prisoners is such a good movie
Don't recall Terrance Howard dropping one "mayne" throughout the whole movie. That may be a first #Prisoners
is prisoners not the most colourless movie in existence
You did not just end the #Prisoners movie like that! Holy smoke!! You get all hyped up & it ends the way it ends. I hate endings like that.
They need to make a live action movie with Pokémon, where they come and rescue the characters from being "prisoners" inside the Poké-balls.
Prisoners whata movie
@JustinVanWyhe Like that bad movie with Stone Cold Austin it. The one where the prisoners fight to the death on live pay-per-view.
But it was a totally different movie to PRISONERS, so maybe it's unfair to compare them. Jake Gyllenhaal was great and now that I'm reading>
OKAY prisoners was fucking incredible. haven't been that absorbed into a movie in a while

can we all just appreciate the fact that prisoners is such an amazing movie. I feel like it doesn't get enough credit
This movie is good 'prisoners'
i have never been so engrossed in a movie as i just was in prisoners
I think 8.1 is kind of too much for a movie like "prisoners". probably 7.2 would've been enough.
Something I never do but will for this movie which is recommend one. Prisoners

Prisoners is probably the best movie ever made

Watching That Movie Prisoners
watching prisoners ..Good movie
still waiting for a movie about prisoners at GTMO that dehumanizes Americans and makes us look like monsters who torture innocent people
"Hydra has Deathlock, Lincoln and who knows how many enhanced prisoners." Like maybe an entire movie's worth
Night crawler was a good movie otc but not as good as Prisoners.
Just watched prisoners yesterday, Hugh Jackman was brilliant but I was distracted by jake's hair and tattoos during half of the movie tbh

A movie about murder inspired a murderer to murder in a movie, just to inspire a Maniac to murder prisoners and making a movie xD #Centipede

One positive of one of the escaped prisoners living is that we should get an accurate made for tv movie out of this in a year or so!
I can hear Hollywood producers/writers minds' just spinning on making a movie on these 2 escaped prisoners...Congrats 2those who ended this!
I'd support the idea of a #nyprisonbreak movie if profits go toward families of the victims murdered by the prisoners & police organizations
Curious: Does anyone know/ have guess on $ spent 2 capture/kill 2 prisoners, Matt & Sweat? Also, when is movie coming out? #PrisonBreakNY
If me and @iilikeme2 ever got kidnapped @SeleziyaSparx would act like Hugh Jackman in the movie Prisoners.
NOW WITH THE KILLING AND CAPTURE OF THESE TWO ESCAPE PRISONERS...WE AWAIT A REAL SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION TYPE MOVIE...WITH A DRAMATIC ENDING
. @NBCNews law enforcement analyst Clint van Zandt on the hunt for the escaped prisoners: "It's certainly going to be a made-for-TV movie."
Kinda upset the two jail prisoners were found. I was hoping for a fairytale ending like the movie Life with Martin Lawrence & Eddie Murphy
@lifetimemovies I'll be waiting for you to make a movie on the two NY prisoners Matt and Sweat; That would be interesting.
can't for wait a movie to be made about these two prisoners escaping

You know how Hollywood messes with the facts. In the movie, the escaped prisoners will get married.

These prisoners have to go out in an old-fashion shootout. Then movie, preferably directed by the Coen Brothers, starring Oscar Issac
Saw the movie #Prisoners (2013). Good movie. Thing is, I watched it so late so I'm so tired.
I love this movie PRISONERS !
Just finished watching the movie Prisoners. What a wonderful movie!!!!!
This manhunt for these escaped prisoners is deff gonna be a movie someday

hey if ur looking for a fucked up movie that has great cinematography, acting, and symbolism watch Prisoners
I mean, the movie also depicted lactating women as prisoners. Actually, EVERYONE is a prisoner of Immorten Joe to some degree.
"Prisoners" was the most underrated movie of 2013. Got robbed of a number of Oscar noms, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal for example.
These 2 escaped prisoners. Did dudes have Game or what? They talked all kinds of prison employees into helping. Movie waiting to happen.

@jimmyfallon watched the movie 'Prisoners' with my dad & he said "gee, I wish it was that easy to lose a child when you were 6" #DadQuotes
They STILL haven't found those prisoners in NY. That escape plan musta been dope as hell. Movie shit
The two prisoners escaping NY maximum prison will definitely be made into a movie, those dudes are probably in a whole nother country by now
This Prisoners movie wild
Those 2 NY escaped prisoners gonna make for a great movie some day
@tacydelacy I still think Prisoners is a better movie. But I was hoping to see a little Rene Russo nudity but alas it wasn't to be
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/bpXfcTF6iVk?a  Prisoners Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal Movie HD

Watching Prisoners.. This movie is scary to me!
" @White_Girl_Em: Prisoners is such a good movie" crazy movie

@NBCNews Woooot Woot they still dress prisoners like that ... this is like watching a B/W movie
The movie that will be made about the escaped prisoners will be extremely nuts.
I wonder which movie and books will be most popular: The NY escaped prisoners or Rachel Dolezal's.
Prisoners is an amazing movie #intense
TV movie about escaped prisoners the woman who helped should be played by Princess Leha
these prisoners that escaped needs a movie bruh..like Steven Spielberg WYA BRUH..CUT THESE NIGGAS A CHECK
These white prisoners escaping gonna be a good movie
I see Shawshank Redemption, Prisoners and Saving Private Ryan all hidden in my Movie folder. Ooops
@HuffingtonPost Prisoners diguised as teachers. Stay on for a year. Kids all get A+ grades. Feel good movie made.
The way the two prisoners escaped from upstate NY jail seems right out of a Clint Eastwood movie.
@ErinAndrews You should be the woman who helped the prisoners in the up and coming Lifetime movie. If you need A director let me know lol
I saw with my friends a movie called "notice prisoners「予告犯」" today.

Eugh Prisoners This movie is so sick I just And I have a feeling the ending is gonna be even sicker
Prisoners is such a good movie but it's creep af
The movie 'Prisoners'.....wow, everyone definitely has to watch it , wow
Can't remember the last Time I saw a thriller like this movie . If you haven't already ,make sure to watch Prisoners .
I'm fascinated by the prisoners that escaped in NY from the safety of living in KY. Sounds like a movie. #nyprisonbreak
Those two prisoners that escaped really pulled off some movie type shit

Will the inevitable movie about the escaped prisoners be called "Breaking a sweat"?
Maybe even the New York prisoners who escaped had a run away car waiting at a strategic point.Heh but CNN is making this look movie-like
The TV special or movie about these two escaped prisoners will certainly be a hit. How did prisoners get power tools? Did they take an Uber?
If those escaped prisoners want to find an empty, desolate place to hide, they should sneak into a movie theater showing Entourage.
Prisoners is easily the creepiest movie I've ever seen, but at the same time so so good. @youssefhanna_
Watch them make a movie about the prisoners who escaped
And #Prisoners was my No. 1 movie in 2013, so, yeah...He's doing well.
That movie Prisoners seriously scarred me for life like I love scary movies but I literally think about that movie and get chills
Prisoners is the best movie ever
Prisoners is such a great movie.
If you haven't you guys should watch this movie called Prisoners the ending pissed me off but it's too good
Dawg the way these prisoners escaped the prison is unbelievable, its straight from a movie
Prisoners wasn't even a horror movie and it was way worse than any horror movie I've seen
Prisoners is such a good movie. I've watched it so many times & it's still just as good every time.
This story of the NY prisoners escaping still sounds like a movie lol they had to have A LOT of help
This whole escaped NY prisoners drama should be turned into a movie on lifetime.
I would watch it if it turns into a movie #wendywilliams two prisoners
“ @MetalClarinet: Look for those escaped prisoners in the FIFA movie screenings. It would be a great hideout -- nobody else is going in..”
