DEFINITELY about to watch white christmas, which happens to be my favorite christmas movie
There's a debate around these parts about the best Christmas movie. Some classicists say "White Christmas."... http://fb.me/7DHAi4U42 
White Christmas isn’t a Christmas movie until the last five minutes where Bing Crosby serenades an inn with the most boring Christmas song.
“White Christmas” in “Holiday Inn” led to the movie “White Christmas” in 1954. Catch them at the Plaza Theatre! pic.twitter.com/nBrib3Yaas
@GrangeBeargirl White Christmas, the song and the movie - priceless for Mom :) #AlzChat

If your argument here is that White Christmas is not a Christmas movie, you're going to need more than that. https://twitter.com/MajorSpoilers/status/670770852971982850 …
Every year I'm left with this perplexing conclusion: there's not a lot of Christmas in White Christmas (the movie). Try again next year....
(Gremlins is not a good Christmas movie either. As I've said before, White Christmas is the best Christmas movie. Live with that.)
