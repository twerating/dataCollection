after actually watching this movie, Troll 2 is another example of 'people don't REALLY know what the 'worst of' things actually are do they'
@wrestlingleva that movie is terrible. I would rather watch Troll 2.

. @Troll2Queen @FarmerWaits We frequently have Troll 2 nights and watch the movie AND documentary. This just made it that much better.
@plentyofalcoves Troll 2 ain't even a bad movie at all tbh
It's one of those things where I feel like to fully appreciate Best Worst Movie you probably need to see Troll 2

Troll 2 is hands down my favorite movie
@wallstreetsam Troll 2 could be the only movie to look even sillier and cheaper than Troll 1.
The best part of BEST WORST MOVIE is when the actress who played the mom in TROLL 2 compares it to CASABLANCA. Wtf.
The plot makes less sense than if you took Zombeavers and Troll 2 and blended them together. It's the worst movie I've ever seen.
Troll 2 is glorious! It's apparently the ultimate bad movie & we're loving every second. Don't piss on hospitality!

@Uptomyknees ooooorrrrrrr "Troll 2" (horror) and "Best Worst Movie" (documentary). #NailedIt
Troll 2: a movie about goblins, a kid with PTSD, and a double decker bologna sandwich that saves the day.
This movie was called Troll 2, and it's actually about goblins and also not a sequel. Talk about a misleading title!
Troll 2 is the greatest movie of all time
Watching Troll 2 by request of @DaveofCRITMO. The sheer amount of pain I feel watching his "movie", brings me to tears.
Sometimes I want to criticize troll 2 but we watch that movie cuz it's bad

@robgokee @ziggytheartist Should have one of those screening on location things there. Like they did for 'Troll 2' in 'Best Worst Movie'.
Troll 2 met and exceeded my expectations. I have found the worst movie ever.
Troll 2 is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Everyone must watch this movie it is laughably bad.
@charliehillart6 @joe_dante If Tobor is robot backwards, does that make this movie a prequel to TROLL 2?

I've actually never seen 'Troll 2'. I've seen 'Best Worst Movie' but never 'Troll 2'. #WatchingNow #Troll2
Troll 2 feels like Castlevania 64 cutscenes as a full movie. It's incredible.
Well this is quite a problem. Now I don't know what shitty movie I'll be watching now. Definitely not Troll 2, that's still downloading.
From what I got, troll 2 is a movie that portrays vegetarians as the devil. I wish I made that up.
1986's No Retreat, No Surrender is seriously the best worst movie, it dropkicks Troll 2 in the face
Troll 2 is a lot more intriguing than I thought @TheTrentPhillis and I are very pleased with the movie @bestworstmovie

troll 2. the movie where you really just want the little kid to die
Troll 2 is the best movie I have ever seen
No other movie has really been able to be as perfectly horrible as Troll 2.
Maybe "almost" isn't the right word. Let's just say that "Troll 1" is closer to "Troll 2" than it is to, for instance, a good movie.
@bad_dominicana the lady who wrote/directed horror b movie troll 2 made it bc of vegetarian preachiness. Also I had a nightmare bout ++
I watched the movie Troll 2 last night. What's great about this fantastically bad movie is that there is no Troll 1. pic.twitter.com/MFKoxI6IyV

@bybowes TROLL 2 is by no means a good movie, but a lot of the humor in it is intentional.
One of the best films I've seen at Hot Docs was the one about Troll 2: Best Worst Movie. One of the funniest things. Ever. #hotdocs
@Mark_Cool_Um @mel_evans This, not Troll 2, is the BEST WORST MOVIE. I own it on Laserdisc.
Troll 2... a classic bad movie! https://twitter.com/RiversofGrue/status/590914160604663808 …
@Pixelfish @elizabethdanger Regarding Troll 2, you really need to see the doco that its former stars made, Best Worst Movie. Good, and sad.
@Troll2Queen just saw Troll 2 for the first time, you MADE that movie, Loved it. Gonna watch it again tonight.

Yo girl are you the movie Troll 2 because you are really stupid but pretty fun late on a friday night when I'm drunk
Morning all. Today I have been followed by actress @Troll2Queen who was in Troll 2. Man I have not seen that movie in years.
Sad to say that The Sandlot 2 is a worse movie than Troll 2
@RiversofGrue @SharonAnnO @robertstainthor @REOFX Wow. Never knew there was a terrible Alien 2 movie and Troll 2 has no trolls. Lol
"how not to make a movie" featuring troll 2, samurai cop, the room, etc
bro i would LOVE to see a movie like birdemic troll 2 or the room in theaters
In all seriousness, I'm pretty sure the movie I've seen most since turning 18 is a tie between BLUE VELVET and TROLL 2.
@07LSU1 Isn't Troll 2 that movie that's widely considered the worst movie ever?
Just watched the movie #troll 2. "They're eating her, and then they're going to eat me. Oh my godddddddddddddd!
Which movie is actually better: “The Room” or “Troll 2?”
Troll 2 is my favourite movie
The Room is absolutely by far, the worst movie i've ever seen. Way worse than Troll 2 and Freddy Got Fendered
@KacyNoel I've never seen any. If I was gonna watch a badgood movie I'd rewatch Troll 2 or The Room

@Sealey_KSR WORST FINALS EVER! Tonight I'm watching: Ishtar, Troll 2, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie & Battlefield Earth instead. #BBN #KSR
If this movie keeps up I may have found a party movie to best Troll 2.
Watched a couple of cool films today: confusing time travel drama Primer, & a documentary about famously terrible movie Troll 2.
These goblins agreed to be in a movie called Troll 2, you can't reason with them.
Never saw Troll 2 but I did see Best Worst Movie.
Im serious. #dinotopia just might be the worst movie since troll 2 or krull. Or some other craptastic movie on here.
Now watching Troll 2 of course. Arguably the greatest movie ever.
I would really recommend seeing "Troll 2". Best movie I've seen in a while.

@phatcarlson I'm sorry the other guys on Movie Fights don't understand the brilliance of Halloween 3 or Troll 2. I do though! Thank you!
The Neighbors makes me love Best Worst Movie more because BWM let me feel glad I love Troll 2, exposing how nice the folks making it were.
I hope that take of @simonpegg going TROLL 2 with "Oh my god!!!!!" will be used in the movie. @chrismcquarrie #MissionImpossible
Lmfao gods not dead has a full five stars on Netflix! That movie was honestly worse than Troll 2 and more propaganda than American Sniper.
The only way is watch troll 2 is if I was high af where I wouldn't care how crappy of a movie it is

Not only is Troll 2 NOT a sequel to Troll, but there aren't even any trolls in it. You can watch the whole movie & never lay eyes upon one.

If Centennial was a movie it would be Troll 2
The difference between shit like Sharknado and Troll 2 is that the director of Troll 2 was like "Yeah...this movie is so gooood."
I legit didn't think Troll 2 could live up to the "bad movie" hype. A guy who turned into a giant plant just giggled as he was chainsawed.

Troll 2 is the greatest movie of all time
Watching a really bad movie to sleep, Thankskilling might be worse than troll 2.
@Chris_Stuckmann Hilariocity! What about Troll 2? Glitter? Birdemic? Alone in The Dark? Simon Sez? Bratz - The Movie? :D
@OnSightsp That movie is a special type of bad. But not in the fun way like Troll 2.
@TenebrisEbur Its needs to be a super bad movie so as to be enjoyable in the same way Troll 2 or Thankskilling is.
If I had the choice of watching The Bella Twins or Troll 2, Troll 2 would win. #RawIsJericho so would that "garbage day!" movie. #RAW

Worst/greatest movie ever: troll 2 #AMustWatch
The entire cast of 'Troll 2' hoped to be extras, and ended up in the lead roles. They had serious doubts about the movie.

@BenLindbergh you sir are 100% no movie trying to be bad qualifies. I will always take a Troll 2 over a Sharknado.
@LAmeetsDC @funkybrownchick Troll 2 is bad, but the director was trying to make a real movie. Twanna wants more campy bad (I think).

Move over Troll 2.....there a new "Best Worst Movie!" #Sharknado2TheSecondOne
Still a better movie than Troll 2 #Sharknado2TheSecondOne
That's why movies like Troll 2 and The Room legitimately have cult status. The people making the movie thought it was a good product
@devincf Agreed. Even movies like Troll 2; those who made it loved that movie. It may be failed art, but it's better than crass bullshit.
Troll 2 is a top tier movie.
@cardinale82 @v3ro15_twitch dude! I’ve been dying to see that movie! Have you seen Thankskilling or Troll 2?
Still a true good/bad movie can't know it is bad. The beauty of Birdemic, The Room, Troll 2, and lots of MST3K movies is they are oblivious.
You guys have no idea what a bad movie is until you see The Room, Birdemic, or Troll 2.
@TheJWittz So less like the Troll 2 and more like a lame horror movie.
@JakeBaldino Exactly my opinion as well... Failing a movie on purpose ruins the fun of it. Real movies fails like Troll 2 is where fun is!

My. God. Discovered a movie WORSE than 'Thankskilling' and 'Troll 2'. I'm sure 'Santa Claus vs The Zombies' violates the Geneva Convention.
That's it for our live tweeting of Troll 2, look for our movie review as the very first DeadLung blog entry!
@ChandraMJordan @thailure Troll 2 is a classic! Have you seen "Best Worst Movie"? It's a documentary about Troll 2! #TeamDaryl

Just watched Troll 2, supposedly the worst movie ever made. Wife must have asked me 4 times what in the world I was watching. It was bad
Sitting down to watch Troll 2 on netflix. Supposed to be the worst movie ever made.
They remade the best movie ever... Troll 2!
Giving very serious thought to watching 'Troll 2' which I've never seen. Widely regarded as worst movie ever made. Do I dare?
How Troll 2 didn't win the oscar for greatest movie ever made is beyond me.
Special screening of Troll 2, described as "The Best Worst Movie Ever!" http://fb.me/KRlPta0z 
If every horror movie baddie came together for 1 epic showdown, who would win? My $ on goblins from Troll 2 #horror #halloween #ScarySussex
Has anybody ever seen the movie Troll 2?
@Troll2Queen you did really well in troll 2. @ChrisWarren9 had me excited for 12 hours about the movie. It certainly delivered.
question for the ages: why is the film called "Troll 2" when the creatures are referred to as goblins throughout the movie? #fb #homealone

if you're in the mood for a good movie, go watch troll 2 and it will definitely change your mind
Best Worst Movie is incredibly awkward and hilarious. Now I want to see Troll 2.
Just watched the documentary Best Worst Movie.....it was quite enjoyable......now I feel obliged to watch Troll 2.
@craigary But I'd watch "Troll 2" and/or "Best Worst Movie" (haven't seen either). Seems less condescending for some reason.
just watched a movie starring a guy named Louie Lawless, who was the worst dad-actor since Troll 2. he even says "piss on this"!!!

Treat yourself to a double feature of Troll 2 and Best Worst Movie on Netflix this weekend. You've earned it.
Troll 2 might actually be my new favorite awful movie
@Troll2Queen @123Jupitar @bleedingfilms The "Troll 2" Queen! Amazing! That movie also messed me up as a kid, haha. Nilbog forever!
Anyone who says 'Troll 2' is the worst movie ever made has obviously never sat through 'The Brown Bunny' or 'Me, You, and everyone we know'
Troll 2 is not overrated. I was writhing in laughter the entire time. Best Worst Movie is very good in turn; both on Netflix.
Watching Troll 2, possibly the best worst movie ever. #nilbogisgoblinspelledbackwards
The same weird-ass Grunt! movie that is briefly spied on a TV in Troll 2 is also shown at the drive-in in Hitcher in the Dark!
People behind us at Troll 2 were reciting the movie from memory, a level of dedication I don't get unless the movie's Army of Darkness.
2 sources of happiness: TROLL 2 on a movie marquis and Phil Blankenship ( @Troniks). Nilbog forever: pic.twitter.com/v0epzotFHi

I highly recommend Best Worst Movie, a documentary about cult phenomenon Troll 2. It's a real life Waiting for Guffman, funny and sad.
Just watched the wonderness of what is the movie "Troll 2." Are you still considered a vegetarian if you eat people?
I hate that I resorted to do one of those movie hash tag things, but I couldn't resist referencing Troll 2. :)
Best Worst Movie - Troll 2 is a quality bad movie, and this doc is pretty good, but c'mon guys, what is all the fuss about? #easedown
Watching Best Worst Movie and reminiscing about the first time I saw Troll 2 that glorious Saturday at VV with @_DanielXIII and @GloomJr

@n8knee1dur Troll 2 is literally the WORST movie ever.. Ask Steve
Thinking of having a Monster B-Movie Marathon at some point. CHUD, Tremors 3, Troll 2, Carnosaur, and cap it off with Sharknado. Date TBC.
You should do a double feature of Troll 2 and Best Worst Movie on Netflix. Go ahead. I'll wait.
Kicking off October Horror with BEST WORST MOVIE, following up last week's TROLL 2 screening. It's kind of perfect.
Just watched a documentary about the bad B-movie Troll 2. Why have I not seen this?! Troll 2 looks hilarious!!
I need to watch Troll 2. Brandon. We need to watch this. It's the number 1 worst rated movie. 00% on rotten tomatoes, 1 star on imdb. Yes.
saw "Best Worst Movie" -- Very entertaining. George Hardy is extremely likable. Makes me want to see the laughably horrendous "Troll 2."
Scariest movie of this era: Patent Troll 2
I think tonight I shall watch Troll 2 followed by Best Worst Movie.
Watching Best Worst Movie...now I kinda wanna watch Troll 2. #BadFilms #CultFilm
@david_lynch have you ever seen the movie troll 2? i have a sneaking suspicion you might like it.

Currently enjoying the absolute worst movie ever committed, TROLL 2. Never seen before. It is truly awful. But fun with a crowd.

I might change my opinion on the @_RunnerRunner movie. It could be the new leader in unintentional comedy. Move over Troll 2. @AGAupdate
Troll 2 didn't live up to all of the hype. It was a bad movie for sure, but there are better bad movies to be watched. #NILBOG
If you're a fan of the peerless Troll 2, I strongly advise you to watch Best Worst Movie.
@HoodieAllen Troll 2, it's really bad, there's no trolls in the movie and there's never been a Troll 1 #Enjoy
