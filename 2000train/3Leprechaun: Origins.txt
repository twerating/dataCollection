Leprechaun: Origins movie review: A WWE Studios production, yet the titular leprechaun wasn’t Stone Cold Steve Austin painted green. Shame.

The new Leprechaun (Origins) movie is really bad. I mean, in the ways you'd expect, but it also lacks any of the humor of the other films.
@JohnTrain77 That was literally the worst movie I've ever watched. Even worse than Leprechaun: Origins, and Rubber, and Thankskilling.

@MimonFishbaum I'm about to watch this Leprechaun: Origins movie for the podcast. It's WWE produced with Hornswoggle as the Leprechaun.
Currently watching Leprechaun: Origins on @NetflixUK fairly sure this movie doesn't do the Irish tourism industry any favours!
Leprechaun: Origins- the movie where the leprechaun looks more like voldemort or the master from Buffy than a leprechaun

I gotta say....Leprechaun: Origins not my cup of tea. The idea of not showing Hornswoggle, in more than halfway thru the movie, is lame.
Whoever directed Leprechaun: Origins owes me an hr and a half of my life back. probably the worst movie I've seen this year
Leprechaun: origins. I'm helllllaaa mad that movie exists.
In case anyone was wondering, Leprechaun: Origins is not a good movie. I know it was a mystery, and I'm happy to have solved it for you.

Wow is "Leprechaun: Origins" a fucking terrible movie.
ALL THE LEPRECHAUN MOVIES WERE FANTASTIC EXCEPT THE LEPRECHAUN-ORIGINS MOVIE PRODUCED BY CRAPPY F-GRADE FILM COMPANY WWE FILMS.

Leprechaun: Origins: The gritty reboot thing to make a more serious Leprechaun movie, except it stars WWE superstar Hornswoggle so lol
@ShoeTheMoo if Leprechaun Origins was the original movie there wouldnt have been a reboot lol thats how bad and irrelevant it is.
Nope, just imagine a movie wrapped with tons of horror cliches and you pretty much have seen Leprechaun Origins
Currently watching Leprechaun: Origins, hands down this is the worst movie of the Leprechaun series.
Drunk watching this pig shit Leprechaun Origins movie
There's no way Leprechaun: Origins is a canonical Leprechaun movie. Why the heat vision? And where were the horrible puns?
Just watched the movie leprechaun origins and the leprechauns look like the predator and baraka from mortal combat had a love child.
Leprechaun Origins was a decent movie...or would have been if it wasn't supposed to be connected to the other Leprechaun movies. As is? Bad.
Netflix is recommending me an Adam Sandler movie and Leprechaun Origins, so I can only assume it's become sentient and is trying to kill me.
If you were wondering the Movie "Leprechaun: Origins" is trash

Leprechaun Origins is so bad I'm still debating whether or not it overtakes Highlander: The Source as the worst movie I've ever seen.
No matter what you believe the greatest movie of the year is, the worst was undeniably Leprechaun Origins. This is a fact.
Netflix has tempted me to watch b-movie insanity. Leprechaun : Origins.

Leprechaun Origins wasn't a horrible movie but I would have liked to have seen more @wwehornswoggle in the creature itself.
Leprechaun Origins would’ve been a decent movie if it wasn’t in the Leprechaun series. Absolutely no reason to have that name.
watching Leprechaun Origins and I’m willing to bet not one person in this movie has an authentic Irish accent lol
Just watched Leprechaun Origins, not a terrible movie, but not great either. I got all 7 Leprechaun movies in a collector's pack.

The new LEPRECHAUN movie should have been called LEPRECHAUN ORIGINS: LEPRECHAUN.
Anyone actually watched the whole Leprechaun:Origins movie with Hornswoggle? So far 49 mins is the most I've seen someone last
Leprechaun: Origins was a good horror movie, but it was a shitty Leprechaun movie, if that makes sense.
...TIL the WWE produces movies. Most recently, Leprechaun: Origins. Also today I remembered theres a new Leprechaun movie.

Finish watch Leprechaun: Origins i give the movie from 1-10 2.5, The movie plot was pretty decent the actors was ok
I feel like Leprechaun:Origins might not be the movie our generation wants, but it is the one it deserves
We reviewed Leprechaun: Origins starring the WWE's Hornswoggle. It's a movie about a leprechaun, alright. http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/leprechaun/238623/leprechaun-origins-review …
Gonna order the new Leprechaun Origins movie on PPV
Leprechaun Origins is a movie you should not see because it is very, very bad.
this leprechaun origins movie was aw-ful.
Leprechaun Origins has a one-liner at the end that rivals the one in the newest Texas Chainsaw movie.
No one watching a Leprechaun movie for a good film, but Leprechaun:Origins is horrendous. At least Lep in the hood worked as self parody.
So. LEPRECHAUN: ORIGINS. Worst movie WWE has ever put out. Not even as good at THIS: http://youtu.be/mlufxatPxnA 
Leprechaun Origins is an awful movie, I'd advise anyone not to bother watching it.
