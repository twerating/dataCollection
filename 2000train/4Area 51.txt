The one and only decisive action he takes the entire movie is to contaminate the clean room at Area 51 @IndependenceDay #Whitmore2016
Lol, I love how much this movie insists that Area 51 is a mythical place so classified that even the president doesn't know it exists.

#Area51 was amazing!! The best movie about aliens and Area 51 ever!! and the best found footage movie since Blair Witch Project!! Go see it!
This movie Area 51 is so corny. There's finally a damn alien at the very end and it sounds like a dinosaur lol
AREA 51 the movie did not give AREA 51 the game as much of a run for its money as I'd hoped, but I was entertained.
Area 51 is a badass movie
I truly hope this Area 51 movie doesn't suck...off to a rough start lolol
AREA 51 does have a handful of intense, clever scenes, but the movie is such a shapeless mess. It could have been 45 minutes long.
AREA 51 feels like the result of 7 years of reshoots and desperate late nights around an editing bay. There simply isn't a movie here.
Just saw movie area 51. I want a explanation of what happened to the guy and girl. #spoiler
this founs footage movie area 51 was pretty decent

CIA confirms existence of Area 51. Suddenly the Area 51 movie (2007) sounds more factual than fictional !!!!!
The looney toons movie figured out Area 51 was real like ten years ago. Come on guys
Area 51 has no aliens which means that Scooby Doo movie isn't actually based on a true story
RT @Optimarcus: If real life was a movie, admitting Area 51 exists would be the prelude to a massive alien invasion.
Cue #Hollywood making a movie about the 'real' #Area51. They will call it - Area 51.
Why the hell is everyone talking about Area 51? I thought that TV, the movie Planet 51 and Escape From the Planet Earth confirmed this?!?!
Horrible that the one direction movie is trending higher than the declassification of area 51 #fucktheworld
Area 51 exists, no shit have y'all seen Apollo 18? That shit was a real movie
Area 51 I've known it's real since that movie called 'Bugs Bunny'
Ben Affleck to make a movie about the CIA and Area 51 next
Now that AREA 51 is officially a real place, will Oren Pell's AREA 51 movie be released?
Even the CIA realized that the last Indiana Jones movie was a joke when it continued to deny the existence of Area 51
CIA confirms that Area 51 is real. This just renews my hope that the movie, Flight of the Navigator, is a true story.
I've been knowing that Area 51 was real since that will smith movie Armageddon
@ChazM2 @AlexsaurusZilla hmm I got idea this bad new. Movie is talk about Area 51 look like dinosaur damage. camera we lost. on @netflix
I knew Area 51 was real. This was confirmed in the movie Independence Day.

CIA confirms the existence of Area 51. Worst kept secret ever! Watched a movie called Area 51. It was shit!
I feel little bit sad that 'area 51' officially excised. The mythical vibe is vanished, and it isn't cool anymore to put it in a movie
In the Disney movie Lilo and Stitch, Earth is referred to as "Section 17, Area 51"! http://fb.me/2j6HvKI9h

Area 51 exists? Will Smith was right all along! And you all thought Independence Day was a shitty movie..
CIA: area 51 really does exist ! Well i never !! Thought "independence day" was just a silly SCI-FI movie #showusthealiens
The government admitted there's an Area 51, which proves 'Independence Day' is the best movie ever. @theatlanticwire: http://bzfd.it/18AfOMR

The CIA has confirmed that Area 51 is real! Well duh, it's only been in every Alien movie for the past 50 years.

I hope that the REAL aliens found at Area 51 aren't as lame as the ones in that crappy Independence Day movie.
Why is everyone shocked that the government finally acknowledged Area 51 was real...I knew that since the Independence Day movie lol
I thought the movie "Independence Day" cleared up all of the confusion about Area 51? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯...
Duh Area 51 is real...am I the only one who's ever seen the movie Independence Day?!
Area 51 declassified as real. New GOP/Teabagger/Birther scandal: Obama is an alien.
....of course Area 51 exists. Didnt any of you see 'Independence Day'? Greatest movie of the all time.
The US confirms the existence of Area 51, yet we knew it existed all along cause it was in the most realistic movie ever: 'Independence Day'
In association with our aliens...Area 51 presents...Area 51: The Movie When humans and aliens get together... the sex is out of this world
Area 51 outedby the NSA? This is news? Wasn't it in a movie or something in the 70s?
Area 51 is no longer interesting. CIA came up with a script admitting that it's a Hollywood satellite studio & Hangar 18 movie proves that.
The CIA acknowledges Area 51 and it haz no Greys So what will they do for the next X-Files movie?
"Area 51 officially acknowledged, mapped in newly released documents" CNN...they should have timed the release,w/ the movie Men in Black III

I liked a @YouTube video from @riste_konzurov http://youtu.be/SnUC-mB5vis?a  Area 51 I Was There(Documentary Movie)
I think the Area 51 reveal on Air Force 1 is my favorite part of this movie. Everyone's reactions are priceless.
Independence Day is such a great movie, Ian Malcolm can write viruses knowing almost nothing about AlienOS and Data is an Area 51 scientist.
Today in movie history, President Whitmore was informed of Area 51 and Capt. Steven Hiller discovered it by surprise during a flyover. JULY3

Area 51 is where they store aliens that have landed on earth. Area 52 is where they store illegal aliens... It's also a porn movie.
Well, the Area 51 movie was a great disappointment.
Had a thought. What if the movie The Terminator was based off of the future. Like Area 51 was building cyborgs, and nuclear war with korea
Superman movie reminds me of Area 51 documentary.

The greatest mystery of all? It's not Area 51, it's how Rod Liddle keeps being given writing jobs. M Night Shyamalan should make that movie.
A movie from my mind. @Maggie_TWD ,an @gm_gatorman74 on a mission from area 51. Into texas searchn for ALIENS!! #ThoughtsLateAtNight
@stigerscurtis Area 51 is the ultimate false flag operation. If it's in a movie with Will Smith, it doesn't exist.
