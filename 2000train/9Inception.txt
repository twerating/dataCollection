Inception was a great movie. It shows you how one reaches the Shore of his Sub-Conscious! You can only build on what you remember. #Quotes
I think I just hate the fact that it's like a movie inception, and that the maniacs take the idea from the actual movie. It's weird.
Inception is the greatest movie ever made I don't care, not up for debate.
Inception is the most trippy movie ever. It felt like I was on drugs while I was watching it

I fucking love the movie Inception
The Social Network was a good movie but it wasn't amazing. Inception was a far better movie.
Inception is still the greatest movie ever made.
Inception most mind blowing movie of all time
@DennisKoch10 @SFSK8rGrrl @JChurchRadio @isindaost Inception, 14 years later. Nobody didn't get that movie. Deep concept there too.
@DennisKoch10 @SFSK8rGrrl @JChurchRadio @isindaost in 1996, virtual reality was #WorldOfWarcraft. That was a deep movie. Like Inception.
That awkward moment when someone is talking about a movie (Inception) and you mishear them and think they're talking about conception.
Watch Inception at tonight's @RBC Movie Night in Kerr Quad! Admission = a donation (i.e. canned good) Starts at 9pm! #RoadToRyerson
Inception is the most confusing/best movie ever
Now I perfectly understand the Inception movie. Wow. Interwoven subplots on the level of Genius
There is 0 doubt in my mind that Inception is the greatest movie ever created. And most difficult movie to understand
Why does soundtrack from #Inception always make me nervous when it is beautiful themes from superb movie?
You know what? Fuck interstellar, inception and batman shits. The Prestige remains Nolan's best movie till date.
@GarethWareth He was awesome in Inception. That movie deserved every award.
@olufisiayomi i think every bond character from inception was made to suit the times and trends when the movie was shot
So I am currently listening to the #Inception soundtrack again. It's so damn epic! I need to watch the movie at some point again
Sometimes I have hope for the future. Then Twilight wins the MTV Movie Awards over Inception. And I break things.
Girls Minds Are More Complex Than " Inception Movie "
Inception. Brilliant, brilliant movie Christopher Nolan you my man are brilliant.

Just watched Interstellar - holy hell was that a good movie. On par with Inception as far as mind blown ability - well done !!!!
I had a dream that I was going to sleep and then I woke up. I felt like I was in the movie Inception or something
