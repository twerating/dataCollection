WHIPLASH: 50% exhilarating love letter to jazz & the drums. 50% most terrifying horror movie I've ever seen. Crikey, what a film!
One other thing about the movie Whiplash was Melissa Benoist. She was great but sadly underused. I was really hoping to see more of her.
Whiplash should win for score of visual media. That movie was dopeee
A year late to the adoration, but this weekend we finally watched "Whiplash." Not a perfect movie but pretty damn good.

For those who are curious Whiplash is my favorite movie
Love this whiplash movie to God who made me.
I watched WHIPLASH last night, and found it to be a deeply wrongheaded and disturbing movie. There is a question that I need answered:
I think this must be driven by whiplash from people who read the (good but grim) book after seeing the (good but sorta uplifting) movie
On the subject of "Grinding Gears", Whiplash, which rules, still should have won Best Picture over Birdman because that movie blows.
Just finished watching Whiplash, such a great movie. Really inspirational
@femme_esq For instance, Whiplash (a movie that I very much enjoyed), part of me can't get passed the centrality of whiteness in that story.

Boyhood, an emmy award winning movie; bout a boy or rather a family being indecisive all the time. i prefer whiplash over this.No offense

Just watched #whiplash on #Netflix, such a great movie.
Movie night with my baby whiplash wow amazing ! @ItaliaCB
why is whiplash the best movie
Sat down and watched the movie Whiplash. It's not for everyone, but by god. I truly love the heck out of the movie.
Whiplash: heavily criticized by musicians, but I enjoyed it as a battle b/t a brutal bully & an egotistical kid. Works as a horror movie.
Watching the movie Whiplash is easily the most stressful thing I've done all week.
Wait y'all ever watched Whiplash? Such a great movie.
Watched yon #Whiplash movie earlier. Absolutely boss
whiplash is the greatest movie of all time
@zakn @mflynny Whiplash. Best movie of the decade so far, in my opinion.

Saw #whiplash again. First time outside of a theatre. Still a GREAT F'ing movie and the music is amazing.
I now see why whiplash is such a great movie... It has one female character and her only purpose is to be the male protagonist's girlfriend
Omfg new fav movie is whiplash omg this movie is awesome

Wow. Whiplash was one of the best character driven movies I've ever watched. Amazing movie.
In the movie "Whiplash" we can learn Nazism, fascism, nationalism should not be repeated. That movie is not a movie on jazz and genius.

Perhaps Whiplash would have been prudent to explore the characters life outside of drumming. Lot of drumming in that movie is all I'm saying
Just watched Whiplash again. Such an amazing movie 12/10
@jumpcutUK Whiplash is a great thriller but Selma wins because it's one of the biggest must-sees in movie history.

Yesterday: Rear-ended going to important gig; felt like the movie Whiplash. Ended with @KoreosUCLA eating KBBQ sponsored by @LAKFF . Not bad
And I think (jam) "Session" means more haphazard way than they do in the movie. so, Whiplash's Japanese title is a little bit odd.

Goosebumps everytime I watch @Miles_Teller murder those drums at the end of #Whiplash What a movie. #JKSimmons #jazz #goodjob
Whiplash is an amazing movie. If you like jazz music in the slightest way please watch it. Such an intense movie
I'm really late to this, but Whiplash is such a good movie...
Super #MilesTeller movie :-) WHIPLASH (2014): http://bit.ly/1B5USQ5  #JKSimmons #Whiplash pic.twitter.com/uwNntL2W5W
Finished #Whiplash. What a weird, weird, movie-ish movie. No plot. No characters. Like Full Metal Jacket, but without, you know, a point…
Holy fuck whiplash was such a sick movie
for my music class we have a group project where we choose a movie to show the class and you KNOW I'm making my group show whiplash
Pardon my French, but holy fuck Whiplash was a phenomenal movie!
Just saw the movie Whiplash for the first time. Hella intense, kinda over the top, but really relatable for musicians…or at least for me.
@froknowsphoto I dig Miles Tenner, if you havent seen him in Whiplash, its amazing drummer movie

Whiplash is an amazing movie about determination. I just referenced it this week. Great post @Jason
@cobbpasha 1. Whiplash 4. Rubber (highly underrated movie about a killer tire. not really what it's about, it's a movie about no reason)
Birdman was an incredible surreal trip of a movie. And so far, Whiplash just makes me mad that I gave up music in high school

After watching WHIPLASH three times, I've come to realize that Paul Reiser is every bit as essential to that movie as Simmons/Teller.
is whiplash is a terrifying drum movie? Or does it represent how the moon landing was faked ? Important questions
Just finished the movie "Whiplash." Incredible. See it now.

@SofiaKintanar Read Misery by Stephen King. Watch the show Breaking Bad. Watch the movie Whiplash or Nightcrawler. Trust me.
Just watched Whiplash on iTunes. Best movie I've seen in the past 5 years. Shocking and inspiring.
Meant to go to bed early but #Whiplash was on and hey, I can't ever turn that movie off

Hi! @ADignorantium I've just watched "Whiplash" which I believe you recommended. A terrific Jazz movie, for all levels of lovers of the form
Damn... J.K. Simmons & Miles Teller are so damn good in this movie already. #Whiplash
#MrRobot is akin to NIGHTCRAWLER, WHIPLASH, and even THE SACRAMENT in how it may not be a horror movie, but I've rarely felt more horrified.
@PalemanUK hey did u watch that movie Whiplash it's about a jazz drummer!! it won three Oscars. was so intense
chiropractor: you have whiplash me: that's a great movie

@michaeldamian1 have you seen the movie Whiplash? Incredible and I'm sure you would appreciate as a life-long musician :) ...fan in Canada
Whiplash is such a good movie. The passion displayed will either have you question yourself or start up some déjà vu
#Whiplash was a great movie. @Miles_Teller killed it, so well done. wish I knew more in the ending though!
I'm rarely impressed enough to rave about anything on Twitter, but I just watched Whiplash - the best movie I've seen for a very long time.
Whiplash is a great movie.... FUCK!!!
Guardians, LEGO Movie, Gone Girl, Grand Budapest, Selma, Birdman, Nightcrawler, Boyhood, Whiplash, Wild Tales are my 10 fave Oscar 2014 noms
@TracyEWymer Aside from WHIPLASH, it was my choice for best movie.
Time to watch a movie @ChrisBourne recommended 'Whiplash' #Music #Movie
@ScatterSports whiplash=good film with complexity of theme rarely achieved by Hollywood. Nightcrawler, for example, good movie but simple
@BaldBryan @HiltyDiggs I finally got to watch Whiplash Friday. Damn good movie. More blood than I expected from a movie about jazz music

My New Favorite Movie of All time is Whiplash! Incredible
the movie Whiplash is so intense and full of emotions i can't even
It's too bad Gwen Stacy died before the release of "Whiplash" . Such a good movie man she would've loved it
Whiplash is a bloody brilliant movie. Absolutely loved it.
@maadzs btw have you watched this movie 'whiplash'? if you haven't you should i think you'll really like it. one of my fav movies ever.
The ending/climax of "Whiplash" is the best I've seen in years. Can't think of any movie with a better ending in like 10 years.
just saw whiplash again. #sheesh Helleva freaking movie
@18_visions Same deal with Whiplash not being a solo movie for Mickey Rourke's character in Iron Man 2. I felt robbed.
Having thought about it: Whiplash is a more accurate Steve Jobs movie than any Steve Jobs movie anyone is going to make.
im now rewatching whiplash and realizing just how important this movie is
"Whiplash" amazing movie. Just amazing
I finally got to watch #whiplash what an amazing movie @JKSimmcns and @Miles_Teller did an amazing job!

Whiplash. WHIPLASH. How this movie didn't win Best Picture is beyond me.
In reference to Whiplash, "This whole movie is just one extended anxiety attack."
Thanks to the movie Whiplash I'm suddenly on a Jazz kick. Jazz is heavy metal without the distortion and Marshall amps.
Just watched "Whiplash". Wonderful movie but so intense that I am now crawling to bed!
Miles Teller's drum playing in Whiplash will never not be incredible. Love that movie
