Normally can't do Santa films as I believe 1984's Santa Claus The Movie to be the definitive work but so far Fred Claus is not the worst
Fred Claus is RTE's Big Big Movie this evening. Brilliant movie, hilarious stuff, a Christmas classic, great soundtrack too :)

MOVIE REVIEW | 'FRED CLAUS'; The Dependent Claus : http://nyti.ms/16d6Sxr 
Fred Claus..hahaha..nice movie...
@zack_tornado Fred Claus. Comel sgt budak tuuuu. I keep laughing when watch this movie. They're so cute!
Fred Claus #TV3 midnite movie :)
Better movie: Bad Santa or Fred Claus
I have to assume that Delivery Man is going to take the place of Fred Claus as Vince Vaughn's stupidest movie.
@Philippa_Perry @caitlinmoran reminds me of the Fred Claus movie. Where there is a support group for siblings of famous people.
Dan Fogelman creator of The Neighbors also wrote Crazy Stupid Love; Cars 2; Fred Claus; Last Vegas; and the upcoming Al Pacino movie Imagine
Fred Claus is literally the best movie in the game
@ToniPatton Fred Claus. I don't know why but I like that movie. :)
'Fred Claus' - Great movie, or greatest movie? #fb
I'll put it this way: we could have had Downey in a PTA picture in 2014, instead we get him in a movie from the maker of Fred Claus

Fred Claus Favorite Christmas Movie <3;
Fred Claus is in a new movie where he fathered a bunch of children. Cool.
Fred Claus has to be the weakest movie ever lmao
Fred Claus was a really nice movie but tonally inconsistent, ranging from being dark and emotional to slap-stick silliness.
@UnknownBear Hence my concern :-) Will check out Fred Claus at some point. I do like a funny crimbo movie and now it comes bear recommended.
@danowen79 not all of them are horrible. Fred Claus was a good kids' movie; I enjoyed the Rom Com 4 Christmases. Wedding Crashers was fun
"Fred claus" what a movie

Why are @TV3Ireland showing a Christmas Movie on Sunday? Fred Claus, if anything show Elf that'd be acceptable.
@tv3 are showing Fred Claus as their Sunday movie. I guess Christmas gets earlier every year.
