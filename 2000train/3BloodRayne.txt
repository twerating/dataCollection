Ok one gripe I have with #Fallout4 so far. There's an NPC that reminds me of that really bad Bloodrayne Movie.
Video game movie ratings should be UweBolls. Similar to degrees for temp. Bloodrayne? 68 UweBolls. SMB? 90 UweBolls. Doom? 88 UweBolls.
LOOOL another bloodrayne movie was made in 2010... Where the fuck was I
Oh no, will The Witcher movie adaptation go down the same failed paths as BloodRayne or Doom? Or something epic: LotR meets Indiana Jones?
WOAH SHIT BLOODRAYNE WAS A MOVIE?????
@ForgetAmnesia Then what inspired the Bloodrayne movie?
@mookiealexander I just started the first Bloodrayne movie and am comforted that people are somehow making shittier decisions than me.
@groceryfiend Ever tried "Bloodrayne" ......it's so bad....or "The Spirit" ....that movie made me want to jump out a window.SO BAD!
or remember all those game movie no one even tried to make good like tomb raider or bloodrayne
So excited for mine and @BrianAlondite's bad horror movie marathon this weekend #BloodRayne #AloneInTheDark #Sharknado
Having a laugh at "Bloodrayne" the movie being R rated. It'd be PG these days.
Wait. What? Someone just called #BloodRayne an "absolute classic vampire movie." Sometimes the #Internet scares me.

@JRHWriting As if he's the 1st good actor in a bad movie for a quick buck. Ben Kingsley in Bloodrayne, anybody?
@LouLasher it's been done, actually. Bloodrayne sequel was a western... there was a Billy the Kid vs. Dracula z-grade movie in the 50s.

WHAT IS IT WITH THE SHITTY WIGS IN THIS MOVIE? #BloodRayne
HE KILLED HIM FOR WANTING ABSINTHE. I DISLIKE THIS MOVIE NOW. #BloodRayne
I will say, from what I remember, Bloodrayne 2 wasn't half bad. It was actually somewhat tolerable for a Uwe Bol movie
Might be watching the second Bloodrayne movie. Rob Reiner's brother plays a Don Corleone and Igor combination. #uwebollmustbestopped
@AnthonyKlaz I wonder if i get to fight nazis to in the third movie like he did with Bloodrayne lol
@MrUrbanBuddha I loved BloodRayne. But I'm a b-movie fan.
This week's #MovieMonday is Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance. Do NOT bur or rent this movie, especially if you want to watch a movie sometime.

When Henry says he's afraid of rain, he means Rayne, as in 'BloodRayne', that terrible Uwe Boll movie.
Bloodrayne was possibly the most cringeworthy movie I have ever seen. So on that note, fuck you too Uwe Boll. https://twitter.com/MyGaming/status/608207808794869760 …
Someone needs to make a /good/ Bloodrayne movie.
@bigJonMosley @TheAngryGM To be honest I am not sure Uwe did the second Bloodrayne movie I saw
Uwe Boll, creator of irredeemable Bloodrayne movie, had an online tantrum cos his kickstarter looks likely to bomb http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/141065-Uwe-Boll-Kickstarter-Rant …

@Jenny_Cage BloodRayne the movie is a gem.

@DMLFury My mistake, it was the 2nd Bloodrayne movie. But I did ask him about Tunnel Rats.
@ChaosSmurf He is the enemy of gaming. Bloodrayne the Movie could have been so good.
@patrickashe @failnaut That was clear the moment he decided to make the BloodRayne movie
Or he could make another incesty Bloodrayne movie.
@leonmiles_ @CringeChannel ... He made Bloodrayne and the Dungeon Siege movie into trilogies? Color me surprised.

nothing can top the Bloodrayne sex scene(movie) @wolfman708 @dryheat115 @dryheatv2 @heidil_rn @p4tr10tboo @souperfan2012 @triggerchik
2011: horror direct-to-dvd movie BloodRayne: The Third Reich is released. It's loosely based on the BloodRayne video games.
It's official, Hollywood cannot make a decent B-movie. "Bloodrayne: The Third Reich" v. "Blade", give it up, chumps.
"Bloodrayne" (2006) is an inane movie (F) #DallasCritic <n87bq5>
IDK, the more I think about this Bloodrayne movie, compared to "Blade", the more I like it.
@DarkBloodrayne -Continues watching the movie, not even noticing Bloodrayne-
@kenlowery Kingsley was in a Uwe Boll movie (Bloodrayne). That puts him over the top, right?

Jason Kidd wanting to be GM after winning 5 playoff games is like Uwe Boll wanting to direct the next Hunger Games movie after BloodRayne.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/jPWUVg73Weg?a  Bloodrayne - Meatloaf Is A Vampire In It (Movie Defense Force)
@LauraBaileyVO What you think of the BloodRayne live-action movie adaptations?
Except I've seen "Bloodrayne 3" and it's probably Uwe Boll's worst movie...which REALLY says a lot. Although I haven't seen Blubberella...

On a side note, I beat Bloodrayne. That is one B Movie-like video game. Pretty mindless, but I enjoyed it well enough.
the first Bloodrayne movie had terrible acting & production values. This one is just......boring.
also looking at some clips of the third Bloodrayne movie, why does it look like a super cheap college film when it was done only 4 yrs ago?

I didn't think it was possible to make a worse movie than BloodRayne 2 until I saw From Dusk Til Dawn 3. :( These things cannot be unseen.
Was Ben Kingsley the only one not high during the production of BloodRayne the Movie? Holy shit that was bad! Looking forward to part 2 & 3!
@Angelheartnight @GamingAnarchist That movie and Bloodrayne really made me hate video game movies.
Today is crap movie and house cleaning day. Today I have crap movies playing on the laptop as I clean this pigsty! First up: BloodRayne!
@filmsack If yall weren't sure what was your worst movie for the show, I think it was either Hardware or Bloodrayne. Remember those two? lol
OK, so the Bloodrayne movie has Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and MEAT LOAF, AND THEY STILL MANAGED TO FUCK IT UP
"Bloodrayne" (2006) is a profane movie (F) #DallasCritic <n37ik7>

@GrudgeReinhold Brule-esque typo in there to boot. movie tip for you: Bloodrayne. Zane & Madsen are two highlights
@Avi_Gaming @JPSalamanca Bloodrayne movie was meh. House of the Dead was worse! lol.
@ashland_94 I never saw the second bloodrayne movie :( I'll have to watch it
@Irishlover20 yea...he was amazing in Freddy vs Jason and then in the second bloodrayne movie.
@LucioFulciFan What's Kristanna's next movie? I liked her 1st Bloodrayne.
@clarkgregg @IMBrettDalton @ChloeBennet4 @Lil_Henstridge @ElleSatine Haven't seen a gift like that since the BloodRayne movie.
Remember that HORRIBLE Bloodrayne movie that they somehow managed to con Ben Kingsley into doing? How the holy hell did that happen?

@CrispEeeBacon There's only one thing Uwe Boll ever directed that was worth watching, and that's one scene in the Bloodrayne movie.
it's hard to take people who say "This movie is an awful piece of shit" seriously when I've seen the Bloodrayne movie.
@ExudingScorpion i liked the bloodrayne movie
. @BillyZane you almost save BloodRayne from being the worst movie I've ever seen, but not quite.
I'm having another video game movie day at my place and had to pick up Bloodrayne. It felt like buying a porno: sweaty palms, black bag, etc
#RTExtraLife Adam - what's your least favorite video game movie? Bloodrayne WAS HORRIBLE.
@CinemaJaw love Kingsley in Maurice, such a good Feste in Twelfth Night, any bad movie where he's the villain (BloodRayne, Prince of Persia)
@Xandromas ??? what movie.. wait not Bloodrayne. "Batman: Blood Rain" where he gets turned into a vampire because of...reasons
@birdiebar It's an awful zombie movie that came out a few years ago. BloodRayne as well, that one is so bad it might be worth watching, haha
@GeneseDavis Hopefully better than the #BloodRayne movie...
is on Xbox Live watching the movie, BloodRayne: The Third Reich (Netflix) until my party members arrive.
@ErikBlevins it’s a chicken or egg movie. Is it better than Bloodrayne 3 or does the terribleness of the B3 make Blubberella better?

watching #bloodrayne . this is an ok movie tho. im gonna watch the last part
Where did all the good acting go in BloodRayne: The Third Reich? The first movie was amazing.
Ok, I'm watching the ending of "BloodRayne 2: Deliverance"! All I have to say is that is a "Really Awsome Movie"!
Ok, at this precise moment, since 10:00p.m., I have been watching this movie called "BloodRayne 2: Deliverance, on the Chiller Channel, 265"
Still can't believe they made a movie based on BloodRayne.
#7 of my top 10 female vampire in a movie is Rayne (BloodRayne)
Watching the movie BloodRayne #vampire
When scrolling through #NetFlix movies, i see the remake of #BloodRayne.What they need 2 do is remake the videoGame.Bad luck w/the movie lol
@_larissa_bg @ErnestoRiley Well I THOUGHT it was a movie about vampires etc "BloodRayne" turned out there was something extra. hahaha
@anduaga_b @ErnestoPiKlauso @Stay_Original_x The movie? It's called BloodRayne
I just realized that Ben Kingsley stared once in an Uwe Boll movie (Bloodrayne). Which raises the question: WHY?! Dear Lord, why?!
I feel like I need to watch a really bad movie, tonight. *checks media server for any Uwe Boll movies, spots Bloodrayne...* #BadMovieNight
@ErnestoPiKlauso @ErnestoRiley haha I missed that reply of yours Sarah! Bloodrayne........ummm what exactly is the rest of that movie about?

BloodRayne, the movie, may have blew but how the hell did Uwe Boll assemble a cast as stacked as he did? Kingsley? Madsen? Zane? Meatloaf!?!

"BloodRayne" (2006) is a disagreeable movie (D+) #AhiMovieReviews (May 10, '13)
Well Bloodrayne 3 was... a movie. That's all I can say about it. Also, it took three movies to get to the games initial premise?
There's a BloodRayne movie? I am both interested and disgusted all at the same time. I threw up in my mouth, then swallowed it.
"Bloodrayne 3" might be the only movie I've seen where Michael Pare looks so ashamed of himself for being part of it. That says a lot.
. @BenALeonard Very. And to think that we used to had to slough through Bloodrayne: The Movie and The Shadow to get here.
@MarkedWardWard this second BloodRayne movie has a pretty decent set. almost makes up for the lack of actors, script, and overall direction.
The name of the movie is "bloodrayne" #LT
They got a "BloodRayne" movie.....wow I remember playing the game yrs ago.
The movie BloodRayne: The Third Reich on Netflix is basically a softcore porno. What the hell.
Bloodrayne 3 is a fucking awful awful movie. There is nothing good about it. Even the lesbian scenes are shite.
@kevharb Of course it was Uwe Boll. The 3rd Bloodrayne movie. I've never made it through any of them.
Bloodrayne: The Third Reich. Hmm, I think more vampire franchises could benefit from this idea. Pity this movie is so very bad.
@UnknownNeo Bloodrayne 3 (I didn't even know they made a third Bloodrayne movie)

I can't believe BloodRayne 3 has a parody movie #blubberella
This movie is so bad I feel like playing Bloodrayne now though
Watching: BloodRayne: The Third Reich. There is some REALLY bad acting going on in this movie. OMG, so bad.
This movie is literally called "BloodRayne: The Third Reich."
I made the serious mistake of watching "Bloodrayne" on netflix last night. At least it was a good lesson in how not to make a movie!
I'm about to make a terrible mistake and watch the first BloodRayne movie.
every bloodrayne movie is on netflix..........
this vanilla ice movie is quite possibly the worst thing I've seen. besides the Bloodrayne movie.
@swizzlesticz I have no lie watched the original bloodrayne movie
Just found a classic video game genre movie on netflix, that's right Bloodrayne! :-)

Did anyone know the Uwe Boll made a parody to his own movie #Bloodrayne 3 and they do not understand causality.
Spend Super Bowl Sunday and have an Uwe Boll movie Marathon and call it Super Boll. Start with Bloodrayne. Ugh.... Horrible idea. Go NINERS.
@scottEweinberg BloodRayne 3 was his best movie that I'd seen & it wasn't that good. Probably his most competent for what that's worth.

....Oh my God Billy Zane you are making this the first genuinely watchable scene in half this movie #bloodrayne
This movie would be made about fifty gazillion times better simply by being more aware of how utterly ridiculous it is. #bloodrayne
They made a *third* Bloodrayne movie. THERE HAVE BEEN THREE BLOODRAYNE MOVIES AND NO WONDER WOMAN MOVIE.
Wait what is this a moody WWII European art house movie on The Movie Channel? No it's just BloodRayne: The Third Reich.
Bloodrayne movie not highly recommended afterall.
The Bloodrayne movie has the perfect sort of campy gore. Feels like it was torn right out of the 90s. Highly recommended.
“@linalovebugg: Bloodrayne is such a terrible movie. I'm mad I wasted my time. Smh.” Yeah nothing like the game.

They made a third Bloodrayne movie. It sucks just as much as the other two. Thanks Uwe Boll
Bloodrayne the third reich. Is the wost movie ever!
This bloodrayne movie is crazyy
Next up, Bloodrayne 2. Imagine if there was a Bloodrayne movie? Oh wait, there was. A trilogy of suck.
Bloodrayne: The Third Reich might have been Uwe Boll's best movie. Take that how you will.

Universal Soldier Day Of Reckoning is now officially the worst movie I've ever seen. Two hours wasted. BloodRayne movie is better than this.
Bloodrayne good but graphic movie......lolz damn..anyone seen it?
@jaxxepps fyi, i just threw away “bloodrayne” because i was too lazy to make room for a new movie in my DVD cupboard …
Bloodrayne is a terrible movie for many reasons, but I cant decide what's more awful: Michelle Rodriguez's accent or her horseback riding.
The only good thing about the movie Bloodrayne:The Third Reich was the cover..
I was just watching a Bloodrayne movie and was admiring the Nazi uniforms lol
At this point I'd like to ask.. why does the opening of the Bloodrayne nazi movie go on for like 5 minutes?
Wow... even though this movie has a half human nazi killing vampire, it was still pretty horrible. http://bit.ly/WXPzbX  #GetGlue #Bloodrayne
An ok movie - BloodRayne
Bloodrayne (The Movie) Has Objectively Good Qualities
as part of our newly started weekend vampire movie marathons (we exhausted zombies) @jaxxepps & i are watching the TERRIBLE “bloodrayne” …
Bloodrayne really should have been left just a game lol, come to think of it has there been 1 successful video game movie?
Silent hill is th dumbest movie based on a game next to bloodrayne.
They did a 3D conversion of the first Bloodrayne movie. I'm sure that just looks delightful.
What was the last movie you watched that was really good?... — Well it sure as hell wasn't Bloodrayne. http://ask.fm/a/1cgjkk2m 
"Guten tag, motherfuckers". THIS MOVIE HAD NO PLOT. AT ALL. NOTHING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WAS MADE. #BloodRayne
You know what's not good? This movie. #BloodRayne
Sooo this BloodRayne movie is terrible. My family comes by to support me but instead hijack my tv and put terrible things on.
I can't believe Michael Madsen is in this movie #BloodRayne! It's weird to see 'Sonny Black' dressed in medieval clothes. #BadIdea
Watched “BloodRayne” tonight. It was atrocious. “Moby Dick 2010” was a better movie. I’m serious.
Stop me from clicking "play" on this Bloodrayne movie. Please, Internet, I beg you.
OHHH MYYY GOOODDD..... They released Bloodrayne 3 movie... the second one was terrible D:

@RaygunBrown OR THAT MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE! OR THE PRINCE OF PERSIA MOVIE! OR THE BLOODRAYNE MOVIE! Okay, bad examples.
I'm not positive whether I got tired and went to sleep during the last movie in my Bloodrayne reverse marathon, or my brain just shut off.

Wait a second...who in the hell thought they first BloodRayne movie wasn't craptacular enough that they green-lit a second? #stopUweBoll

I had no idea there was a third Bloodrayne movie. I bet it's awesome.
You guys! The 3rd Bloodrayne movie is now on netflix streaming! @thriftynerd I think I made your movie choice for you! :)
Bloodrayne is a stupid movie.. so generically amusing to men & ashamed to say my bf likes it -.-
Is BloodRayne a good movie to watch?

@PorcelainWidow Step 1 to a good Bloodrayne movie: Don't hire f*&king Uwe Boll!!!
There's a third Bloodrayne movie? THERE'S A THIRD BLOODRAYNE MOVIE! #thereisnogod

I feel sad that the #BloodRayne Betrayal game didn't come with a free digital copy of the Uwe Boll movie.

Bloodrayne The Third Reich?! Really?? A 3rd movie? Apparently I missed this and not mad at all.
Bloodrayne is on, such a bad movie, but hell Kristanna Loken has tits!!! The ending reminds me of Chronicles of Riddick
well....this BloodRayne movie is...interesting. Meatloaf, Ben Kingsley. Yet the movie itself is incredibly...SHIT
I thought Bloodrayne game was shit, but nowhere near as shit as the movie. Talk about bad b movie, this has got to be one of the worst lol
LOL. There's actually a third BloodRayne movie. Of course... they had to name it "BloodRayne: The Third Reich". Let's see what's it about...

This movie is RIPE for a fan commentary. I did want to Bloodrayne. I may have to call an audible.
The critics were right, #BloodRayne the movie was terrible.
Cobra has officially displaced Bloodrayne as the worst movie ever. No redeeming factors whatsoever.
If I remember correctly, BloodRayne was a terrible movie. I don't know why I'm watching it now.
@PsychicPirate Oh. Rayne from Bloodrayne (game, not movie.) She did a number on me.

I actually like the BloodRayne movie! The lead actress wasn't up to much mind especially in the fight scenes.
@theDivaLea @bonniegrrl OMG! Guinevere Turner wrote BloodRayne!!? That movie should have been awesome!
When a movie's opening credits say "Special Appearance By Billy Zane" you know it'll be great. And by great I mean, bad. #BloodRayne
@SplitPersona @the_REAL_Raiku Still better than his appearance in Bloodrayne. Everyone involved with that movie should be ashamed.

I must say BloodRayne is a poor excuse of a vampire movie.
Oh dear god. Bloodrayne the movie sucked.. & the first 5 mins of Bloodrayne 2 totally suck... Why am I watching it?

@Earth2Kim It's a Uwe Boll movie (Bloodrayne, Alone in the Dark, etc.). Somehow he manages to get name actors in his crap movies.
@kurayami666 Bloodrayne is a movie taken from a video game. Movies about video games = fail
Bloodrayne: Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, Meat Loaf, and Billy Zane being in a Uwe Boll movie isn't normal, but on meth it is. Not Even Once
Bloodrayne: Ugh... Not the worst movie we've ever seen, but still. Ugh. And we're convinced Ben Kingsley was drugged and forced into this.
This gal playing Rayne is hotter then the gal who played her in the first Bloodrayne movie. :)
just past the credits and this movie is already hilarious just because of the casting! wtf ben kingsly? #bloodrayne
Woot!Bloodrayne 2 The Movie!!
@TheClementines that is the worst movie ever. No, actually, Clash of the titans and then Bloodrayne and THEN ladies man.

@waywardcross you have to see this doc, JUST to hear the "Bloodrayne" writer talk about her movie, it's hilarious.
Just finished BloodRayne. Everyone will get the opportunity to watch the movie alongside me tomorrow.
Everyone avoid last airbender. It's the worst movie ever. Rather watch bloodrayne again.

Wow, Kagan is actually the Ben Kingsley villain in Uwe Boll's Bloodrayne movie.
RT @TeresaMedeiros So glad I saw BLOODRAYNE so JONAH HEX wouldn't be the worst movie I've ever seen!
@TeresaMedeiros There can't be a movie worse than BloodRayne! I think if Jonah Hex is in the same category tho, I'll pass.
One of those Jonah Hex posters reminded me of that Bloodrayne movie I rented on dvd once. #lolUweBoll

God Bloodrayne was a terrible movie. #ggtv #discuss
@zombie_76 I actually thought the far cry movie would be better, same as how bloodrayne would be good
@PraxJarvin the rusty gate scene was the best moment in Bloodrayne. you see his FarCry movie
I'm about to load up some Bloodrayne 2. I paid a $1.50 for a movie/game 2 pack. Crap movie. Hopefully a decent game.

Bloodrayne is the lamest movie I've ever seen. Ever.
@DrRus Ah, kind of like BloodRayne. LOL God, that movie was horrid.
bloodrayne is just...not a good movie
I'd like to edit Prince of Persia and Bloodrayne together. I'd call the new movie, "Ben Kingsley loves money."

Watching Bloodrayne. Best vampire Movie EVER.
Having a movie day first one is BloodRayne 2: Deliverance on Syfy
Watching the movie BloodRayne... learn from my mistake... not even good campy fun.
@AStrokeOfLuck really???? Sweet, tbh, this movie ain't that bad, as long as uwe boll isn't directing it like Along in the Dark or Bloodrayne
Oh dear, I hope this rumor is false but is #Uwe #Boll making a 3rd #BloodRayne movie?
i know what the next gen consoles need... a third BLOODRAYNE game, and while they are at it get rid of Uwe Boll & make a decent movie of it.
How the hell did Bloodrayne get such an amazing cast when it is such a craptastic movie?
thinkin bout downloadin BloodRayne... havent seen that movie in FOREVER and i kinda wanna watch it but idk...
What's your fave video game movie? Not gonna lie, mine's BloodRayne.
@zhandlen Though if Bloodrayne was any indication, he was supplied with all the liquor he wanted on that movie.
why is there 10 minutes of recap at the end of this movie reminding me of the movie I JUST watched? #Bloodrayne
@cusita77 ok and whatta bout the breed, 3 AM, resident evil, bloodrayne, cats: the movie, and IGPX <--- immortal grand prix? includin lost?

@mhasko Great! Rick brought one I've wanted to see, and we were thinking of double-featuring Bloodrayne and the Mario Bros. movie.
I can't believe I actually payed to see BloodRayne in theaters. I remember that movie was straight up painful. Fuck you, Uwe Boll
Really annoyed that they are making yet another BloodRayne movie. At least Willam Belli is in it though.
Bloody First Look at Clint Howard in 'BloodRayne: The Third Reich' http://tinyurl.com/yaaxedn #news #horror #movie

Oh fuck. Uwe Boll is coming out with another movie. It's the sequel to his Bloodrayne movie. It better contain 100% less awkard sex scenes.
Oh look. Uwe "I am shit" Boll is making a third Bloodrayne movie. Gosh. I hope its not a dramatic flop like the first two...
To clear things up; the movie that I'm gonna watch is Bloodrayne, not Mr Nobody. Don't let that hashtag fool ya x)

Oh yeah, some updates: there's gonna be a Bloodrayne 3....movie, where's the 3rd game? :'(

Wtchn dis bloodrayne movie... http://myloc.me/4zHjn

Far Cry was Uwe Boll's usual crapfest. However, it's still a better movie than Alone in the Dark or Bloodrayne 2.
@PrincessNite coool. way cool , iused to work in movie stores =D good times. Bloodrayne & Showgirls those are horrible movies.
AM I THE ONLY ONE PSYCHED FOR UWE BOLL'S NEW MOVIE BLOODRAYNE: THE THIRD REICH, COMING OUT IN 2010?! HELL YEAH! .../sarcasm
@ZhivaM Bloodrayne 2 was even worse! But Tara Ried as a professor puh-lease. I know it is a movie and all but really? REALLY? Come on!
BloodRayne (the movie) was pretty 'meh' in most regards.

BloodRayne movie review - "Excellent" by Raja Afzal on TrustedOpinion™ www.trustedopinion.com/review/1364762
Watched Bloodrayne 2. Anyone who subjects themselves to an Uwe Bole movie is a masochist of the highest order....I must really hate myself.
@Vocabulariast haha... did you really have to bring up Bloodrayne for Kingsley? why not change the second movie to The Sound of Thunder too?
New post: BloodRayne – MOVIE REVIEW | IUBFORUM.NET (http://cli.gs/D004B)
New BloodRayne movie? I haven't seen the 2nd one yet cause it was straight to video which we all know means its shit.

@JazzMX5 How totally stoked are you for the new bloodrayne movie? You must be so super excited.

@heatherjoyness I've been watching movies on Netflix. Saw a cheesy movie, BloodRayne, with Michelle Rodriguez in it.
@Bloodrayne what a horrible movie. the writing sounds worse than Cutthroat Island...
Kinda not happy w BloodRayne movie. Fx were just crap & def coulda had better actors.

@WindowsGamer Oh i see :D yeah, no wonder...for me, its BloodRayne that comes to mind. Loved the game and then the movie...just...ew.
watching the worst german porno synchro of a movie on rtl2 tv ever.. bloodrayne 1 & 2 #LOFNOTC #epicfail
BloodRayne: probably worst movie ever. still, it does have halfnaked kristanna loken and michelle rodriguez with swords...
Watching BloodRayne - Laughing about a #Boll movie is like making fun of a clown because he looks funny - utterly redundant

@deno_alldayy dis crazy movie called bloodRayne
Watching BloodRayne. How are there so many good actors in such a shitty movie?
@urbanko that can be fun..especially when its a crappy movie..like bloodrayne
"Bloodrayne" 75% I liked to watch this movie... It has a great story-line... have seen it a few times... @moviecritter
"Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance" 20% Nothing to do with vampires, just a bad wild west movie with teeth @moviecritter
Ah Bloodrayne... Such a shitty ass movie. Its almost ridiculous that it actually made it to DVD
@jakobmedlin Awesomeness abound! Haven't seen any of those. I've also been recommended Bloodrayne, Trancers, and that Killer Klowns movie.
@etdragon @improbable42 have you two seen the Bloodrayne or Far Cry movie?
I must confess, I found the Twilight movie to be quite well done, it was , however viewed after watching the travesty that is "Bloodrayne"

Wait --was there a Bloodrayne 2 Movie??? http://tinyurl.com/ya8yy34
Watching Bloodrayne. Did Uwe Boll instruct Madsen and Rodriguez "Don't act like you would in a movie, act like they do in video games"? OMG
I don't want to offend anyone but BloodRayne was not a very good movie. I'm sorry. It actually really sucked. Ooh, vampire pun!
when it comes to twilight..2 things..not as bad as i thought it would be..far better then bloodrayne which is at the bottom of my movie list
Finished season 4 of BSG. Tonights bad movie will be bloodrayne. Soon I'll have watched all of Uwe Boll's films. :)

Bloodrayne 2 video game pretty satisfactory! Unlike the movie :(
Better crappy movie: Bloodrayne, *ing Kristanna Loken. Mmm!
sat watching bloodrayne 2 deliverance. its a cross betwen a vampire movie and a western movie. looks ok so far.
@the_tonberry OMFG BLOODRAYNE WAS HORRIBLE. EVEN BY MY LIKE BAD MOVIE STANDARDS.
@FilmSnobbery disappointed there was no Lesbian Vampire Killers or BloodRayne on your favourite Vamp movie list :P
Bloodrayne is a fucking horrible movie....the best part was rayne sex scene she has nice boobs
@comiXology "video game and movie favorite BloodRayne." <-- see? :D if anyone likes the movie I shall... well RANT! :D
Also in today's comics: video game and movie favorite BloodRayne.
@zomb1etron I've seen all of the game/movie ones bar Far Cry and Bloodrayne 2.
Raptor Island was the worst movie I've ever watched. Much worse than Bloodrayne, Postal or even House of the Dead. It was great fun though!
I think that this is the first time I have ever seen almost all of Bloodrayne. The video game would have made a better movie.
Watching bloodrayne on syfy Channel.. Movie is not good.. Gonna go make breakfast.
How to make a Bloodrayne movie: don't get Uwe Boll to direct, and pick a better game.
Aww hell they're making a third Bloodrayne movie. Why, God, why? Weren't the first two bad enough?

Facebook friend surprised that the Bloodrayne movie sucked. Her first clue should have been the "based on the mediocre video game" tagline.
Bloodrayne is pretty much the worse movie I have seen this year.
the movie on the other hand... and i know i'm late catching this.. couldn't be more disappointed.... absolute poor portrayal of BloodRayne
So I spent the day resting today... watched the movie BloodRayne.............. Just absolutely terrible in every way...
wheee-watching another cheesy syfy movie - "BloodRayne" - great leather look-all vampire slayers should wear something similar...
Star wars a new hope or bloodrayne...movie sunday
Watching a movie called BloodRayne. Twitterverse, is it any good?
Why is it that in Sliders Kristianna Loken seems american and in BloodRayne she seems like a lost foreigner? Then again look at that movie
right, time for a bath, finally found BloodRayne!!! so it's homework and cheesy movie, i likes!
watching Bloodrayne , i love vampire movie and shows like , angel, van hesling,and others , I.m me if u do 2.
This Movie Bloodrayne was sooo fucking corny I feel sad for anyone that saw this in theaters
Saw the Bloodrayne movie the other day. I wonder what the point of it was. No wit, no heat, just lots of gore and a diffuse war-movie plot.
About to watch bloodrayne for the first time. I know it's a Cleveland steamer of a movie but I just gotta watch it.
is starting movie four...BloodRayne!
G.I. Joe is now in a death match with BloodRayne for stupidest movie I have ever seen.
Regardless of anything I may have said, I suck as a movie critic. Today I liked P2, Next, and Bloodrayne. Still don't like Wild Hogs.
"Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance" 0% Awful sequel to an already horrible movie! @critbot

@ellisakeller You missed bloodrayne. the best movie ever made.
Is there REALLY a BloodRayne movie?
@JaneWiedlin Yes, BloodRayne is one awful movie.
I just saw the worst movie ever made. BloodRayne. One of my fave games. I'll never get those 60 sec back.
I wonder if they'll ever make a decent Bloodrayne movie. You know, with Nazis or anything remotely like the game.
BloodRayne on SyFy, after watching TANG.... can't stop laughing... It's so silly. and thanx to Uwe Boll another video game movie gone wrong
First Serenity and now Bloodrayne, twwo of my fave worlds (unfortunately the movie suxs), but a great way to end a fab weekend!!
It *is* Shitty Vampire Movie Sunday on SyFy! I was right! (though "Perfect Creature" isn't shitty. Seriously. But "Bloodrayne" is next!)
After watching Dead or Alive, Super Mario Brothers and Bloodrayne, Doom seems a really good movie.
This just in: Dack watches a lot of bad movies, and he loves Uwe Boll, especially the second BloodRayne movie.
Watched five minutes of Bloodrayne, and turned it off. Uwe Boll is a complete hack and should never be allowed to make another movie!
Dragonball Evolution is probably the most god awful movie I have ever seen. I think bloodrayne was better...
Controversial director Uwe Boll is behind our movie on Sat 22:55, BloodRayne. The sequel BloodRayne 2: Deliverance is on Sun at same time
@mcvane That is scary- I just came across Alone in the dark 2 and another bloodrayne movie. Sad thing they r not hokey or a cure 4 insomnia
Despite the beer's influence, I still recommend never watching Bloodrayne 2. A total lack of tits makes it the lamest Uwe Boll movie yet.

I think I'll watch Surf's Up. Yes, a kid's movie. A colleague loaned it to me, so I should watch it eventually. Besides, it's not Bloodrayne
@NoelClarke u telling me Pepsi have employed the same ppl that R responsible 4 Mama Mia the movie & Bloodrayne 2 2 come up w/ drinks?
@DrWicked SPICE WORLD is my favorite scary movie ever. And BloodRayne 2 is missing from the list; it (arguably) is a crime against humanity.
Watching BloodRayne movie. So far, crap :P
BloodRayne is great movie. It is just a really, really, really great movie.
next movie: "Bloodrayne."
Do I go to bed? Don't have to be up untill 8.30! And I have a vampire movie called BLOODRAYNE 2 on bluray? Faith no more kicked ass !!!

30 days of night is the 2nd worst vampire movie I've seen, still not as bad as Bloodrayne 2 tho.
@madlyv Hi, Virginia. Saw your bro in a movie last night, "BloodRayne" think it was. Is he that intense in person? In "real" life?
There is nothing better than an Uwe Bole movie to waste a Saturday afternoon. except an Uwe Bole sequel that is. That's right Bloodrayne 2!
chick in the bloodrayne movie....kinda hot....movie sucks ass....I wonder how many people watch the crap movie for the hot chick?
watching the incredible movie that is Bloodrayne....*eye roll*...and making lunch
So I decided to keep going with Netflix on demand and watch BloodRayne; I feel robbed. It takes serious talent to make a movie *that* bad.
You know, this movie is really calling to attention the fact that the weapons of Bloodrayne are really impractical
Today the Cavalcade will be live-blogging Bloodrayne (2006) off netflix streaming. Yes, we finally have the guts to show a Uwe Boll movie.
bloodrayne is the worst vampire movie ever. their vampires were a rip off of the buffy tv show from being "dusted" to their face changing.
is watching Bloodrayne II: Deliverance. Blood dribbling + corset-y boobs = best scene ever. (from first movie, not 2nd, lol)
Bloodrayne (the "movie") was beyond awful. Netflix Watch Instantly is still cool.
Finally got around to watching ‘BloodRayne’. A seemingly B grade movie whose only redeeming quality was all the excessive gore. 3 out of 5.
Bloodrayne was a terrible movie, so explain to me why a sequel was made & more importantly WHY am I watching it?!?!
I never doubted it, but good lord the Bloodrayne movie is teeeeerrible
gonna watch bloodrayne now - last movie for the w/e along with some nice sarmies... chillin' way to end a sunday.
@cascandar Btw, you look like Rayne from the game/movie 'Bloodrayne' in your pic, hehe
Why is the movie BloodRayne on the Zone Horror channel? It's shit, it should be on the Zone Crap Channel. :)
Just found Bloodrayne on tv. Finally get to see how bad this movie is.
Bloodrayne 2 has got to be the dumbest movie I have ever turned on. Nothing clever, just plain awful.
Watching a crappy movie called BloodRayne II: Deliverance on the SCI-FI channel. My my what a way to spend a Sunday.http://twitpic.com/3m15i

I'm watching Bloodrayne and I completely agree with Erica; she could have made a better movie in her toilet. This thing is AWFUL!
EVERYONE HAS LIED TO ME. The Bloodrayne movie is awesome!
Watching Bloodrayne....wow, this movie is atrocious.
I am watching the worst movie (yes i include anything by jennifer aniston) BloodRayne and I cant look away!!
Words cannot begin to describe how infinitely horrible the movie "Bloodrayne" is, and yet I can't stop watching it...
Watching bloodrayne with the sissons. Jesus christ this movie is horrible

Anyone ever seen the movie 'BloodRayne'? How was it?
@BloodRayne_br that's the best part of The movie!
@paulapoundstone Oh I know you're not kidding. It was probably the worst vampire movie I've ever seen. And that includes BloodRayne.
Is on sick leave at home and watches Bloodrayne. Meat Loaf seems to be the only one who knows what movie he's in, and acts accordingly.
been a pretty blah day. tonight is just me and a movie... possibly bloodrayne
Seen where Uwe Ball made Far Cry The movie, & Seen where BloodRayne 3: Warhammer is Coming out, Hope its not a Disappointment Like the rest
Bloodrayne was the 1st movie I ever laughed openly AT while watching at in a theater. (I have a really low standard for movies)
For such a cast, Bloodrayne the movie is pretty bad.
bon allez c est décidé ce soir c est bloodrayne 2 teh movie
We watched Bloodrayne last night. Deliberate choice of bad movie so we could mock it. And it was *bad*.
@jephjacques dunno if you read these, but if you want a REALLY bad movie check out Bloodrayne. I can't say anything that'll prepare you.
BloodRayne movie: "The movie was criticized for not having much of a story, and for hiring prostitutes to reduce production costs." haha wut
Max Payne = WORST VIDEO GAME MOVIE EVER!!! Yes, I am including Mairo Bros and Bloodrayne in that comparison. BAD BAD BAD!
@MichaelTurk - Have to agree: BloodRayne is the worst movie ever made from a video game. Scrapes all the way through the barrel's bottom.
I liked Resident Evil, but I have to go with Tomb Raider as the best video game movie. Worst had to be Bloodrayne. I couldn't finish it.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen? Tops on my list are Bloodrayne and "The Keep." (Could see the zipper on the monster's suit.)
watching the greatest movie ever on scifi...Bloodrayne...oh the agony.
Watching BloodRayne for shits. My first Uwe Boll movie and his directing reputation proves true. What a horrible, horrible director.
netflix streaming is a problem. they have tremor's 1, 2, and 3, as well as bloodrayne 1 and 2. i see future bad movie marathons!
BloodRayne 2 ... wasn't enough. It seemed like it could just be a tv episode ... not movie worthy, but it has potential ...
Then again, the nicest thing you can probably say about "Bloodrayne" (the movie) is that at least it has video game-grade dialogue.
@triciahonea Bloodrayne 2?? Where she fights Billy the Kid and his army of killer vampires??? Best movie ever.
I think this movie on scifi is Bloodrayne. But not sure.
Watching the Bloodrayne movie on SciFi; how does Herr Boll get awesome actors in his crappy movies?
@helloheath Mine as well be miss "blood" red hair either that or I'll put you in the starring role of the third "bloodrayne" movie HAH!
Omg bloodrayne movie is soooooo bad. And not in a good way.
Doing research on movie soundtracks and found Uwe Boll MADE A SEQUEL TO BLOODRAYNE. This is scary. Really, darn scary.
For tonight's horror movie I reach into my home library and pull out Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance http://ping.fm/FIUGf
holy crap there was a bloodrayne 2 movie? ugh.
Half-vampire BloodRayne rides into Deliverance for a showdown with Billy the Kid and his army of vampire cowboys. Best movie premise ever.
LOL. Zack Ward (Scut Farcus from Christmas Story) is in this movie...I'm done with bloodrayne 2.
The resturant im in has a tv tuned to the SciFi channel, which is showing the movie Bloodrayne. Do these people want to make me hurl?
I asked her to get a zombie or vampire movie, she got me bloodrayne... A movie based on a game... this can't be good
@saronia Uwe Boll is a movie director he did the Bloodrayne movies
Bloodrayne 2 is on Sci Fi channel today. Good time to try our 24 hour podcast movie commentary. No wait, I don't wish that movie on anyone.
@SnowBear I've suffered through Bloodrayne. I don't think any new footage is going to give that movie any help.
I can't help but giggle when I see a "Director's Cut" for a completely worthless movie.. Bloodrayne. Really?? *titter*
@niczak Bloodrayne is still in my book the worst movie ever.. that which all other bad movies are compared, and consistently fall short.
Thursday night movie night...and since I didn't wanna see BloodRayne: Deliverance on the SciFi Channel, I'm catching Iron Man.
Good gravy, Bloodrayne is a horrible movie. I heard bad things but wanted to see for myself. I'm sorry I did. :x
About to watch Bloodrayne, the movie. I hope it's as bad as it looks.
bloodrayne movie made no sense should I tourture myself with the sequel on scifi?
Tonight's 9:00 movie on The Most Dangerous Night of Television is BloodRayne II: Deliverance. No. Just...no. I have standards.
I am re-realizing what a bad movie BloodRayne is... too lazy to hunt for a good DVD. How lazy is that?
BloodRayne may be the worse movie since Ed Wood's films... deliciously so because it tries so hard and falls so short
Bloodrayne 2( the movie) is horrible...
Movie time.. Watching bloodrayne 2
dear uwe boll, considering how badly bloodrayne the movie did... what would posess you to make TWO more bloodrayne movies?!
@giannii usually, you can bet a uwe boll movie is going to be extremely bad, so bad it's almost good. bloodrayne = no exception :)
In memory of Joe, I decided to give BloodRayne a peek on Skiffy...wow, Joe wasn't kidding about this movie.
Guns: ok (for a bad movie). Reform School Girls: better than Bloodrayne, but not good.
Watching the BloodRayne 2 movie.
Why did I jump straight into "Epic Movie" after "Bloodrayne 2"? Will I ever learn?
watching BloodRayne, wondering which scene was the "re-shoot after realizing the movie made no sense" (only 1??)
Keeerist, Bloodrayne 2 is even worst than the first! I didn't think it would be possible to make a CRAPPIER Bloodrayne movie & no nudity!!
