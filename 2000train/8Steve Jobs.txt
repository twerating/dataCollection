when is it my turn to play Steve Jobs in a movie?
@rondaracha so that's two strikes for a Steve Jobs movie? Tsk tsk
So my friend told me the Steve Jobs movie is a total snoozer but they liked "The Big Short" very much.

So they made a movie about how Steve Jobs was actually an asshole. How about they make a movie about how bread is made of wheat.
One more Steve Jobs movie and I'll take on the job of killing ppl who write new Steve Jobs movies.
Steve jobs movie is shite. If I wanted to hear a 90 minute argument about jobs I'd have listened to @cooper_m show.
Steve Jobs movie worth a watch; Michael Fassbender was fantastic. Bravo Danny Boyle

Saw the Steve Jobs movie. Fun for Apple fans, great writing, def fake scenes, but they were MILKING that Lisa relationship. 3 of 5 's.
The Steve Jobs movie is really great and worth seeing. Entertaining, little bit funny, little bit sad, interesting format for a biopic.
Steve Jobs movie - fabulous - clever - gripping. Fassbender astounding. And a favourite Bob Dylan track for the closing credits.
I was not the least surprised when a movie about Steve Jobs was not a hit. We idolize the wrong people in this country.
Steve Jobs is an interesting movie. It's also a movie that has barely anything to do with the person Steve Jobs nor any interest in him.
Saw the Steve Jobs movie. 'Twas alright.

The Steve Jobs movie is great. Almost a stage play. Oozes quality.
Steve Jobs movie was a brilliant character profile, but the script felt as though it would work better on the stage than on the screen.
Really disappointed in the Steve Jobs movie. Constantly simmers at length before a premature "climax", never capturing Steve in any depth.

The Steve Jobs movie is superb. Wonderfully put together. It's predominantly 1 on 1 conversations but the acting ensures attention. Watch!
My main thought about the Steve Jobs movie: why don't all these rude people just let the man quietly prepare for his presentations?
Finally getting to watch Steve Jobs: The Movie today. I’ll be posting a review on the blog this week.
'Find IPhone, Steve Jobs is a motha fuckin genius' I'm weak as fuq at this movie rn. Everyone go watch Dope, it's on Redbox
I heard the next Steve Jobs movie will be on IMAX. It's the same movie, just on a bigger screen.
A better Steve Jobs movie would take place over three long scenes set right before the premiere of three different shitty Steve Jobs movies

Steve Jobs (the Movie) much more interesting than it sounds. Fassbender brilliant. Nobody wanted to go with me so just me & my iPhone.
Decided to watch 'Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview' instead of the new 'flop' movie. Generally not a fan of him but it's a great interview :)

Oh and I heartily recommend watching a movie at @Everymancinema in Birmingham. Lovely sofas and food. "Steve Jobs" was good too.
I enjoyed the Steve Jobs movie a lot more than I thought I would. Fast paced high drama from Danny Boyle & Aaron Sorkin. Excellent cast too.
Steve Jobs movie. Highly enjoyable. That Sorkin fella certainly knows his way around a script. #bartletforamerica
Half way through the Steve jobs movie the libertines started playing for no reason whatsoever hahaha it was so random

So it turns out that Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' movie is actually a three-act play. It's also brilliant.
Steve jobs is more a documentary than a movie. Still learn something esp think different.
Really liked the Steve Jobs movie. Well acted, well written and beautifully directed.

I mean, after reading Isaacson's STEVE JOBS, seeing Boyle's STEVE JOBS, what's another Steve Jobs movie?

Steve Jobs is a Bruce Lee film with words instead of fists. The verbal fight scenes are a blast. No deeper than a kung-fu movie, though.

Steve Jobs movie review: more of an Aaron Sorkin vanity project than a film on Steve Jobs http://www.shuffleplay.net/2015/11/04/steve-jobs/ … #SteveJobs
The Steve Jobs movie did so bad that it got pulled from movie theatres LOL
I hope we don’t get another Steve Jobs movie. The one that came out is being pulled from over 2000 theaters because no one went to see it.
Here's some perspective on just how badly the 'Steve Jobs' movie flopped http://on.mktw.net/1M4B5mz  pic.twitter.com/r3ZlWVakkR
"Steve Jobs movie is unceremoniously dumped out of theaters" http://buff.ly/1lhhiaS  #apple #feedly
Okay, so if neither movie could support a wide release, the obvious solution is a mashup: STEVE JOBS AND THE HOLOGRAMS.
I really wanna see the Steve Jobs movie
Next week's Indie Movie Monday is Steve Jobs: The Man Behind the Machine. Come check out this compelling doc! pic.twitter.com/XHxVKGtzdd
Feel like the Steve Jobs movie franchise needs a reboot.
When you adjust for inflation, the Sorkin “Steve Jobs” movie made about as much as the Ashton Kutcher one nobody talked about.
Sorkin's Steve Jobs was pulled from more than 2,000 movie theaters because no one went to see it http://nzzl.us/nb8BJSs 
Wow, the Steve Jobs movie is apparently a 3-ring technicolor flop. (You probably already knew this. I’m just finding out.)
The "Steve Jobs" movie flopped in theaters so they pulled it. Did you see it?
The "Steve Jobs" movie was a great watch! Thank you Kathleen for facilitating a great trip! #MySLC #SteveJobs
Dear @netflix, Can you make a movie/3-part series on the life of Steve Jobs? You'd be doing a service to...everyone in the world. Thank you
Great. I was just about to announce my own Steve Jobs movie too. pic.twitter.com/UEclykngjh
Is the Steve Jobs movie making less money than the Apple Watch?

I've heard mixed reviews about the new Steve Jobs movie. Anyone seen it yet?
Awesome to see the Steve Jobs movie, great to see the real side of Jobs @slcbiz @SLCMktg #apple #stevejobs
you know that the steve jobs movie was a dud when it's out for more than a month and there are NO torrents. nothing. not even cams.
Are there not already enough movies on Steve Jobs? New movie tanks and is pulled from theaters. http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/11/10/steve-jobs-tanks …

I didn’t think it deserved praise as a depiction of Steve Jobs, but didn’t expect Sorkin’s movie to fail this hard: http://www.cultofmac.com/396493/steve-jobs-movie-is-unceremoniously-dumped-out-of-theaters/ …

Hopefully the disastrous nosedive the intentionally misleading movie “Steve Jobs” took will discourage future filmic slanders of real people
It failed because people know who Steve Jobs is/was. Dude hasn't even been dead 5 years. The people want a WOZ movie https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/664155446702313472 …
Steve Jobs movie is dumped out of theaters. Aaron Sorkin got one right, “nobody did this movie to get rich.” http://www.cultofmac.com/396493/steve-jobs-movie-is-unceremoniously-dumped-out-of-theaters/ …
the extent to which I empathized with Steve Jobs in the movie kind of confirmed a lot of troubling suspicions I've had about myself
@tvaziri I think Steve Jobs was just one of those things, not necessarily the harbinger of a new era, just a movie people didn't want 2c.
Actually pretty darn surprising to hear that the Steve Jobs movie did poorly in Box Office.
@Deathbyfuego @Atari_Barbie so did the steve jobs movie
Thank you @KhalidAlzanki for tonight's Steve Jobs movie screening #SteveJobsOnFire
The Steve Jobs movie is getting brilliant reviews, but dying at the box office. I’ve seen it and it’s great - go and see it!
@tvaziri Also unfair/sensationlized is a bonus. I think the "oh jeez another Steve Jobs movie" thing got to it in this particular case.
Thank you @KhalidAlzanki for the perfect Steve jobs movie !
