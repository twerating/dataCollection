Mad Max Fury Road is the best movie of 2015, Just give it the best picture Oscar already.
News - Mad Max: Fury Road is the best movie of 2015 http://ow.ly/38zrtV 
So Mad Max Fury Road was chosen as movie of the year? Last year, the same group chose A Most Violent Year. Apparently they hate scripts!
@AwardsDaily Nope. Mad Max: Fury Road will take it. NBR unleashed the deep desire for critics to champion their darling movie of the year.

Mad Max: Fury Road being named the "movie of the year" is absurd. So, a movie that's basically one long car chase is considered the best?

Watched "Mad Max: Fury Road" on my flight. Good movie, except it should have been called "Mad Furiosa and some crazy/angry guy called Max"
The visuals are piercing, but if you want to see a gruff white dude traverse vast terrain, "Mad Max: Fury Road" is a stellar movie.
Just watched most of the Mad Max Fury Road action scenes again thanks to a 10 cent rental on the Windows 10 Store. Best action movie!
Finally watching Mad Max fury road... first thoughts: Can you get Masters of the Universe the movie on DVD in the uk these days?
Don't know anything about the movie Max. Assuming it's a Mad Max: Fury Road remake with a dog protagonist.
the question is will Star Wars unseat Mad Max Fury Road as my movie of the year so far

#NZSkepConf A reverse narrative of the Mad Max Fury Road movie. Terrorists against the establishment. Terrorist or warrior of freedom?
Becoming more and more convinced that Mad Max: Fury Road is really just a movie about Las Vegas in 15 years.
Mad Max: Fury Road is a pretty great movie about children becoming grown-ups, or failing to do so. Also exploding car acrobats. But still.

Mad Max: Fury Road is the greatest feminist movie !!!
Overall, The Martian gets the SECOND 10/10 I've given a movie in 2015, the only other one being Inside Out. Yes, even Mad Max: Fury Road
Mad Max: Fury Road might just be my top movie of the year holy shit
"The Martian" just may be the best movie I've seen this year. Yes, even better than "Mad Max: Fury Road". Crackerjack direction and acting.

Unpopular Opinion: Mad Max Fury Road, a great action movie but i still prefer Road Warrior.
George Miller's original feminist opus is not Mad Max Fury Road, it's this bonkers movie, three decades earlier
the second half of mad max fury road is the best movie of all time and the first half is the second best

Correct. Mad Max: Fury Road voted year's best movie by international film critics http://gu.com/p/4c2kc/stw 
@bearekhale same for the Mad Max: Fury Road, I was striked by the beauty of the images and the feminist message of this movie,
Look, Mad Max: Fury Road was an insane action movie... But people need to calm down. It's not the freaking best movie ever made.
I liked a @YouTube video from @johnflickster http://youtu.be/ZtqOzgvyJZA?a  Mad Max: Fury Road - MOVIE NIGHT!
