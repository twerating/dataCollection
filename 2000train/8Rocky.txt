I have three...two? Some short amount of weeks to complete my New Years resolution from this year, which was to watch ONE Rocky movie.

A new Star Wars movie, a new Rocky movie, a new Quentin Tarantino movie. What a time to be alive. And what a great way to end a year!
I understand there's another movie series everyone is excited about ... But I'm stoked about this latest rocky film ...Creed!! #kingofsting
Best movie ever. Still feels the same. #Rocky!
There's a Rocky movie out, a Star Wars movie opening and The Rolling Stones and KISS are both on tour. What year is it again?
dude Star Wars is gay the only good movie is Rocky
Heads up you guys--DO NOT see the new Star Wars movie. I saw it last night and it was just TONS of boxing with Rocky as a guy's coach.
'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' has been shown continually in movie theaters since 1975, making it the longest theatrical run in history.
A friend just told me he just watched and didn't care for the movie Rocky and I feel like I was just insulted personally.

One thing the #Creed movie has made me do is have the #Rocky soundtrack in my head the past couple days. Which is perfectly okay.
Creed is far more of a Rocky movie than I anticipated, and in that respect the lack of embarrassing choices in it is flat out incredible.
Last night, I saw a new Rocky movie (fantastic, by the way) & in 9 days I will see a new Star Wars movie. We're in golden times, my friends.
For the record, I wouldn't call the Creed movie "amazing" or anything. It was just very enjoyable if you're a fan of the Rocky series. I am.
Had free movie tickets, so we went to see #Creed last night. I loved it & have established that my dad is Rocky Balboa #whatcloud

@RyanWaltonMLB The first Rocky movie is a must see. You won't regret it. Classic movie.
My roommates have not seen the Rocky movie might have to move out
The Rocky series is hands down one of my favorite movie series of all time
Watching a rocky movie makes me want to go workout
The movie Creed was pretty good! I should go back and watch the classic Rocky movies, never seen them
"Creed" is a very good movie. & an excellent ending to the "Rocky" series.
#Creed was an amazing movie. Has the #Rocky feel to it but still it's own movie. #Stallone needs at least an #Oscar nomination for sure.
@RajaSen Perfect Rocky movie, isn't it? Hit every note. Also, never thought I'd associate Michael B. Jordan as more than Wally from Wire.
Nobody ever went the distance with Creed up to that point. Rocky IV best Rocky movie though. https://twitter.com/battlefieldtrip/status/674471495263907841 …
Rocky is a good movie. It's not about winning, it's about being committed. It's about goin the distance!

Rocky VII was a solid movie! @YourManCarruth @rcolquitt @dallasg15
A$AP Rocky & Vince Staples look so damn fine in the movie
Had no idea this Creed movie goes with the Rocky series..... I HAVE to see it. How did I not know this....
Creed was an amazing movie. Worthy successor to the Rocky movies. I hope they make a trilogy out of this story.
Christmas list: grey sweat suit, tape, boxing equipment, rocky/creed movie series, trainer, boxing gym.
If you haven't seen #Creed yet you need to go see it ASAP! Amazing #movie #Rocky #Boxing

Cleansing my spirit after watching Rocky. I don't care how sentiments y'all are. That movie is weird and makes me uncomfortable #majorleague
Did I just cry during the new rocky movie? Yes. Yes I did. #creed #amazing #emotional
Growing up on Rocky made this movie 10 times more enjoyable and touching.
@HooterTrevor @J0hnnyb0y3 @kyle_gordong @WorldStarFunny I'd rather watch this than any Rocky movie or Creed any day

I never knew Rocky was just a movie character. I literally thought he fought Muhammad Ali. See ya.
I've never seen a Rocky movie, but Creed was solid.
#Creed isn't just for the rocky fans. It was a very good movie
Never Back Down is easily my favorite non-Rocky fighting movie
Rocky will forever be one of my favourite movie series
@ReelSchool Yup. He's great too and his relationship with Rocky is the heart of that flick. Guy has the charisma of a movie star.

Like, all the Rambos and Rocky I-IV. No, I can't to integrate that, but I do have an okay idea what boxing in a movie could look like.
My favorite Rocky movie is the one where he fights Bullwinkle.
Best Rocky movie of all time? I love the original- but I love Rocky 3 as he took on Hulk Hogan and Mr T #eyeofthetiger

@KPMemphis10 Creed's love interest, Rocky for the first half of the movie.
To this day I have not seen any Rocky movie or Godfather movie
I've never been big on the rocky movies or anything that has to do with fighting, but Creed was an incredible movie. Would recommend.
A ROCKY movie has come out, shortly to be followed by a STAR WARS movie. Feels a little like I'm in a time warp & a teenager again.
Rocky IV is my favorite Rocky movie
Creed is amazing. the new movie in the Rocky series as well as the band lol.
@Englishwithdan i like it he resembles the rocky guy in the fantastic 4 movie
Nobody go see Creed that new movie. The black guy doesn't win at the end and Rocky gets cancer.
As someone whose favorite movie series of all time is the Rocky Series, I can honestly say that Creed was amazing. Might be my fav movie.
Watched #Creed Yesterday Night... Amazing movie... @theslystallone's perfect Tribute Rocky 1 Movie... Oscar Worthy performance...
Imagine the sheer size of the BALLS you've got to have to go to Sylvester Stallone and say "Hey Sly, I got this idea for a ROCKY movie..."
The Rocky movie series is beautiful.
@BS_lamb22 Haha I cry during every ROCKY movie so I am bracing myself for openly weeping during CREED. I'll give ya my review right after!
Holy cannoli, Milo Ventimiglia is the spitting image of Rocky's son from the last movie. Casting director dun good.
Rocky is the best boxing movie I've seen
Rocky Creed hands down best movie Iv seen this year
New Rocky movie, "Creed" is good, worth seeing.
Just watched that movie Creed. It was great. It's like they took that movie Rocky, and then... continued in that fashion identically.
Renee just called rocky horror picture show "Rocky Mountain horror movie" ...so close
Creed is a very good movie and I've never seen many of the Rocky movies
Went to #Creed tonight and I have to say it is a great movie.. Best rocky movie since the original rocky!
I'm kinda drunk and kinda debating live tweeting my movie tonight but it'd probably be a dozen tweets that say "A$AP Rocky is on screen now"
Ended my Rocky marathon with Creed. Epic movie that captures the essence of the first. #Creed #Rockybalboa #cinema #Boxing
Do yourselves a favor & go see #Creed the movie, NOT the band. It holds it's own and is on par with Rocky 1 & 2. Very impressed.
Rocky 4 is the best movie hands down
Dilemma of the night: Which Rocky movie to watch. Help a brother out here
Possible movie marathon themes for 25/12: Stallone, Rocky, Paris-set, WWII mission. I’ll keep thinking about it.
Creed is an awesome movie. After these finals Im watching Rocky all weekend long. #addicted
creed was just another rocky movie to me..
If a movie can be a "Xmas movie" because it's set at Xmas, then Rocky is the best one ever. I will literally fight anyone who disagrees.
Rocky Movies are the best movie series and I don't care what anyone says and Slyvester Stallone is my idol #ItalianStallion #Rocky

Creed was a really good movie. And I'm not a fan of the rocky movies
@JMcDonald_SAEN he honestly just sounds like a made-up Serbian caricature from a future Rocky movie at this point
Creed was really the hardest movie of the year if you watched rocky when you grew up you might as well go see it ..
Don't get me wrong Creed was an amazing movie, but Rocky I did it better...
So I'm really late on this but movie of the week. @creedmovie great film and great storyline. My favorite #Rocky since the first one. Must C
Creed was a cool movie. There was a lot of rocky Easter eggs that honestly made it better for me..
If you haven't seen every Rocky movie. During holiday break Educate yourself, Before you go watch Creed. It's worth it.
I don't want to be disrespectful but Creed could possibly be the best Rocky movie

@babrooks213 THIS MOVIE IS GOLD. If you can see a live screening with Rocky Horror-esque participation, do it. And maybe with a group.
Even Rocky didn't win until his second movie #MotivationMonday
Definitely Worth Watching #creed #boxing #movie #rocky https://www.instagram.com/p/_Ago4IshRk/ 
Can't see how Force Awakens can be a better Star Wars movie than Creed is a Rocky movie. WOW! Best movie I've seen for a while.
I do love a fight movie and Southpaw was pretty good... Particularly loved mandatory 'training montage', very rocky-esque!
Have to say Creed is the 2nd best Rocky movie behind the original.3rd would be Rocky Balboa.
STILL thinking about #JOYMovie... I haven't rooted for a character that much since, well, Rocky. [NOTE: This movie is nothing like Rocky.]

@JournoJenkins67 it's a spin-off Movie, Stallone said he doesn't want people calling it Rocky 7, it's Creed 1 not Rocky.

@piersmorgan Rocky IV should be higher, especially considering that Drago is the obvious hero of the movie.
I think Rocky 4 is now my favorite Rocky movie!.
@thelittlenative Rocky from the 1985 movie mask got swole as fuck
@aricewooooo I cried. Watching Rocky in that movie was like watching my own grandpa. You feel so attached. We're watching it again on Wed
Nothing as hype as a Rocky movie with Meek Mill on the soundtrack
@KG1116 Mike loved that movie but hated Rocky IV. In other news, Mike has a vagina
so far the common complaints are michael b johnson is too good looking, it feels too much like a rocky movie, and the characters are thin
Seeing a couple of negative replies about #Creed. If you didnt love that movie you are lost. I cried like 5 different times during it #Rocky

Creed is an excellent deconstruction of the perils of glory-hunting ala Rocky. Such a good movie, I love that it's in the same universe.

i'm want to have a mean girls viewing party but like rocky horror so i'm watching the movie and making shit up.
Creed, better than expected. But still only the 5th best Rocky movie.

The last two rocky movie was wack imo
Rocky is the worst movie ever.
#CreedMovie is great! Wasn't excited about a new #Rocky movie but all the buzz finally pushed me to go. Best 1 since the first 1. #Oscars
My goal for this week is to watch a Rocky movie per day. Yes it's horrible but I've never seen any of the movies besides part 4.

@HeisenbergMUFC I'm guessing they also said something along the lines of, "that new rocky spin off movie is gonna suck balls"
In the movie creed rocky dies and Michael b Jordan loses his last fight at the end of the movie
I really hope they play up the homage to the first Rocky movie with him climbing something and putting his fists up in the air.
@rafialarm no the new movie... Rocky sequel!! Haha
one last Rocky movie and i can finally watch Creed
Creed was a dope movie. Michael B. Jordan was fireeeee. S/O to Rocky too.
rocky movie marathon and chill ??
The latest Rocky inspired movie Creed drew a total 5 votes - 3 loved it. 2 were just ok. @onefm913 What about you?
@rns_funhouse see..heres the thing….Rocky 4 is a terrible movie, but I f'n love it.
@RachelVerrill THIS was on the back of a t shirt in the movie and I CRY because ROCKY is so IMPORTANT to me
Creed is really a good movie! Even though I've never seen nun of the Rocky movies.
When this is all said and done, I'm gonna watch every single Rocky movie.
@_Cc13_ I've got the second movie planned out... Rocky dies and he has to fight to defend his title against someone
I liked Creed, however Michael B. Jordan is a terrible actor. Also, I don't think the movie is going to age well. #rocky #movies 2015

Really enjoyed Creed, even more than the original Rocky. It has standard boxing movie thrills + great shots, complex hero & relationships
Rocky 3 was such a good movie
Coogler/Jordan collaboration CREED is fantastic. Best Rocky movie since the original. Fights are incredible. Sly gives emotional performance
CREED isn't even like the fourth or fifth best ROCKY movie.
Saw #Creed today. People were cheering loudly in theater. That hasn't happen, well since I saw the last Rocky movie in the theater 9 yrs ago

@MarkHarrisNYC I love how it plays like a Coogler movie rather than a Rocky movie directed by Coogler
Creed was AMAZING! Definitely up there with Rocky & Rocky IV. Haven't been that pumped in a movie for a while. That final fight is intense!
After a long day, nothing's better than a cup of hot green tea and a good movie. Watching "Rocky V" now.
I just want a full movie night of all 5 rocky movies and bake some goodies!
Creed was such an amazing movie! Watching all Rocky movies asap.
I've loved every single Rocky movie since I was a kid, still do
Oh wait. I'm totally talking about the new Rocky movie. Not that alt rock white dude band.
If you guys haven't seen Creed yet, go see it...like now. Best movie in the Rocky franchise besides Rocky IV
That movie is a MUST see in my opinion. Especially if you like Rocky movies. https://twitter.com/womanof_beauty/status/673693983885926401 …

When Sylvester Stallone struggles to walk up some stairs in "Creed," I felt like I could finally relate to a Rocky movie.

@HeathActor I'm a fan of every Rocky movie. Including Creed which I just watched a few days ago
@Myg LOL yes Creed is a movie. It's a new entry in the Rocky movie series starring Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. Really good.
I've now officially watched every single Rocky movie with my dad. #memories #Rocky
@trey31968 @GoApePodcast @SavageGM @ApesMovies that Escape movie was trash. It's the Rocky V of POTA. Or as you guys would say, Generations.
Creed may be the best movie I've seen this year. I had no expectations of it to be anything more than a cheap Rocky cash-in, but DAMN.
Just saw #Creed I have seen every Rocky Movie. This was fantastic @theslystallone @michaelb4jordan i hope there is a sequel. #CreedLives
Call me crazy but Rocky 4 will forever be my all time favorite movie.
Man. CREED is a must see for any Rocky fanatics or movie lovers in general. The acting, the cast, the soundtrack, and Michael B Jordan.

I've watched every Rocky movie in the time this drive has gone on.
Rocky is such a motivating movie
Dad: "I wish They had another rocky movie" Me: "They have one where he trains Apollo Creeds son" Mom: "He's not talking about space"
It stuns me that a movie as good as Creed was built on the back of a movie as bad as Rocky IV.
I've never claimed to be a movie buff tho. I've also never seems any of the Rocky movies in totality.
A Rocky movie is in the theaters, a Star Wars film is on the way, & Jimmy Carter is in the news. We live in 1976.
Btw, if you haven't seen Creed yet, go see that. Especially if you're a Rocky fan. That movie was amazing.
@JoshuaCMills @MirandaSajdak if I'm following this correctly I've never watched Rocky and thought it was a guys movie. Never will.
@JoshuaCMills @MirandaSajdak feelings that are like the feelings the movie Rocky does? I'm confused at why it's a question to women
@jockromance do a training montage for your final so you're doing your final in the spirit of a rocky movie
When all you wanna do is stay in bed and watch every single Rocky movie.

#Creed was sooo PHENOMENAL! I'm a sucker for a Rocky movie.
Creed. Pound for pound the best Rocky movie since the original
Creed is one hell of a movie! If you're a Rocky fan, you should definitely watch it.
When you love #TheThreeNinjasKickBack movie so much My fave childhood movie of ole time!! #Rocky #Colt #TumTum
My friends made me feel really silly tho bc I didn't realize Rocky was ACTUALLY Rocky until the end of the movie.......
I never realized how handsome ASAP Rocky is until watching the movie " Dope"
Creed was real good. Maybe 2nd best Rocky movie. For a new generation, 1st best
Saw creed tonight. Absolutely a great film, a must see especially for those who have always been rocky fans. Touching movie really hits you.
" @alwaysjiving: @thatdivamsjay girl, I just found out yesterday that it was a Rocky spin-off type movie." it's okay
Read a review that said Creed was the best Rocky movie since the first and I have to agree. Extremely well done.
@LMurphyDC as you can see, I love Rocky as an Italian neo-Realist movie that somehow is in Philadelphia

Rocky will forever be my favorite movie
Creed!! What a movie! Any young athletes looking to be inspired should defiantly take a look at what the Rocky/Creed movies have taught me!
Watching Rocky for the 1st time in ages - it's amazing how programmed I am for these beats, this chord progression of a movie, to affect me.
Creed is a good movie if you've seen and liked the Rocky series
Creed, like the 1st Rocky movie, isn't about the fight, but what the fight represented, and the journey there. And it's all so well done.
Lol RT @Nerd_Ferguson: Poor Adrian feared for Rocky's life in every single movie. Except the 6th lol
There's a lot I could say about the great Creed movie but I'll leave it at this. Donnie fought to redeem himself. But he needed rocky
#Creed is a great movie. Very cool modern version of Rocky I. Stallone is fantastic as wise, old #Rocky. Loved it. Perfect end to franchise.

What's everybody think of this new Creed movie? Is it hit or miss? You know I love me some Rocky.

Waiting for Creed to start! Great sports movie series of al time! #Rocky
Creed was definitely a sick movie #ApolloCreed #Rocky
I just realised that Jim Carrey's "The Mask" and the movie "Mask" about Rocky Dennis weren't the same film.: I... http://bit.ly/1ljgbYq

They wasn't lying when they said Creed was the best Rocky movie since the original Rocky. Movie was excellent.
Just saw "creed" shockingly good movie very impressed. Might be the best rocky
OVER THE TOP is basically "What if ROCKY was a bad movie?"
Quite excited to see #CreedMovie tonight. I haven't seen every #Rocky movie but I did play Adrian in a skit back in ESL class years ago ;-)

These were facts I needed, since I have never seen a Rocky movie and did not realise at first that the box contained Apollo's shorts.
If you play the commentary from every #LCFC game backwards at double speed, you hear the soundtrack to every Rocky movie.
I've never seen a Rocky movie before, but luckily we were sitting next to two small children who were full of facts for the entire 2 hours.

I just started watching Rocky Horror for the first time...so far I'm enjoying this twisted movie
On way home from seeing Creed, sons talking about need to turn the garage into a boxing gym. Exactly the desired effect of a Rocky movie.
The only movie showing that i could make is Creed ... i've never seen one single Rocky movie
The only thing the movie creed was missing was rocky screaming "ADRIAN! ADRIAN! ADRIAAAAAN!"
Who better to review 'Creed' than Creed? Watch Scott Stapp review the 'Rocky' spinoff as a movie about his band. http://relm.ag/8yXG4H1 
At first I didn't want another rocky movie. Creed was a great movie and it gave me the feels of nostalgia.

Watching the new Creed movie was an emotional roller coaster. Been a fan of the Rocky movies since I was 8 .. Crazy how time flies by.
@PrincePrithvi Rocky is most inspirational movie series ever - thats why it is still loved after decades
Now Meek Mill took a lot of Ls lately, like a lot. But having your song part of a training montage in a Rocky movie, now that's a W #Creed
Finally saw #Creed. No one was gone acknowledge it was the black version of Rocky 1 though lol...good movie though
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" has been shown continually in movie theaters since 1975, making it the longest theatrical run in history.
I saw #Creed last night, and it's the best Rocky movie since the original.
You don't have to watch a rocky movie to watch creed,its a standalone movie tied in with the rocky saga

"Creed" is a good movie, but that's because it's mostly just the good parts of Rocky I-IV. Every plot point has a direct predecessor.

Creed is the best Rocky movie. Hands down
Creed - Official Trailer 2 [HD] https://youtu.be/JQ9OhBYjTds  via @YouTube This movie, 11/10! Best Rocky movie since the first. Awesome. See it.
CREED was fantastic. I love Philly. I love Rocky. I love Michael B. Jordan. And I love going to a movie and being moved by it.
Creed 8.6/10. Second best Rocky movie ever made. I'm all in with Coogler and Jordan, great combination with Sly at his understated best.
@juhaymee_lee YOU'RE MADE OF LIES. YOU LIKE ROCKY ROAD AND YOU'RE FAVORITE MOVIE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CARS
The first rocky movie is so good. I love it so much.
Creed was literally such a great movie. It was no Rocky, but it did it justice.
I never seen no Rocky movie, so I was confused when it first came on
Ya don't understand my love for Rocky, this movie gave me life!!!
@Cammyiceee best movie in the rocky series in my top 5
Rocky ain't a boxing movie it's a romance.
Finally saw Creed. Excellent movie... Might be my new fav Rocky film. Shoutout to @michaelb4jordan for killing it. K-phi! Jersey we out here
A new Rocky movie and now some new, classic Bruce. The East Coast gods are bringing it this December. https://twitter.com/RollingStone/status/672951705361883136 …
Creed was very solid! Awesome movie and you know Rocky killed it. An outstanding job once again from Sylvester Stallone #WhatAFreakingLegend
@TeecycleTim no..the latest rocky movie
I saw CREED tonight. I teared up a lot. It is a REALLY... REAAAAALLLLYYYY good movie. Especially if you're an old-school Rocky fan.
I thought a quiet study room is a place where I can work on my paper in peace, and not to have to listen a Rocky movie marathon
I watched Creed and then proceeded to watch every Rocky movie after
i'm absolutely not joking when i say that rocky 4 is like, my favourite movie.
Just watched Creed. Loved it. #Philly What's your favorite movie of the Rocky franchise?
If Rocky died, movie would've been A1.
Creed was a great movie. If you're a Rocky fan or a Boxing fan, must see. Soundtrack being so dope was an added bonus.
Creed may be the best rocky movie yet #iwas impressed
At wrestling a guy said I look like the underdog in a boxing movie.Motivation #rocky #creed
I may be biased being a huge Rocky fan but Creed was an amazing movie. Amazing
@ohsoevy it ends like rocky 1 tho Same type of movie pretty dope tho
Creed was a great movie. Go see that. Black director/screenwriter and a Black lead made for arguably the best installment in the Rocky saga.
December 4, 2015. The day I will forever remember as the day @kennnnnnnnny tricked me into watching my first Rocky movie.
I'm the biggest Rocky fan and honestly, the movie Creed was so good. Got me a little emotional

@darionturner96 rocky, but nothing will ever be as good as rocky, but it's Def a great movie for sure
Creed movie up there with the rocky ones still
Creed was the best movie I've seen all year and a contender for best Rocky movie.
@deray Nice movie - even better if you know about Philly. More Philly than any of the Rocky movies. Whole scene about the word "jawn."
Creed was a phenomenal movie. Great continuation for the Rocky series! Already looking forward to the 2nd!
The entire Rocky movie series is on sale on iTunes for only $24.99 in HD. What a steal! #iTunes #Rocky
#Creed is awesome, another one two punch for Coogler & Michael B. Jordan. This movie captures the spirit of Rocky perfectly. Stallone, wow!
Creed is the best movie I have ever seen!!! It was basically a Rocky VII and I'm hoping for a Creed 2!!
It's me, the guy who hadn't pieced together that a boxing movie called Creed was a Rocky sequel
rocky IV is the best rocky movie
I've never seen a Rocky movie, so now I'm going to try and watch all five tonight
iPhones are cool and all, but the 80s had inspirational music, movie montages, and a new rocky movie every other year. And top gun.
Creed Was A Good Movie It Is A Great Modern Day Rocky Movie
Hold up. You telling me at the end of the movie- #Rocky lost?? What. How is this movie popular?
@Juliemahan624 I hate that movie that black bitch look like asap rocky
Went to see #Creed tonight with the family! It's a great movie and very inspirational, it was a great way to keep the Rocky movies alive!
Wow @JacobPadilla_! Tell @Ei_Ei_Ayooo & @EdChang_1 they can take tomorrow night off. Maybe catch the new Rocky movie or something. #MyTreat

@SamGriot I liked that it seemed like a rocky movie without being a movie about rocky. Plus PHILLY! Lol
@tammy_burr That is kinda long for a Rocky movie!
Watching the original Rocky movie for the first time ever. I’d live tweet it, but I expect to hate this so much that you’ll all hate me
Just saw the movie Creed. It was amazing! Sylvester Stallone did a good job closing the final chapter on Rocky and starting a new one.

ROCKY is a really excellent movie.

Rocky Balboa is a damn good movie.

The Rocky IV training montage might be the greatest thing in movie history.
If people are going to consider Die Hard a Christmas movie, then so is Rocky 4.
Mike Francesa is losing his mind on a guy who said Rocky III is the best movie in the Rocky series.
Rocky IV is the greatest bad movie ever made. Hearts on Fire is greatest training montage ever. Francesa's bit on it, though, was amazing.
I liked a @YouTube video from @screenslam http://youtu.be/-FR2zH9EXn4?a  Creed: Sylvester Stallone "Rocky Balboa" Official Movie Interview

Just saw Creed, the new Rocky movie. It was great in true Rocky form. Great fight scene. Loved it! Another good one, Sly! #CreedMovie
If you think about it, #Creed was a risk. In a way, it was like, "Hey, let's try doing Rocky 5 again." The 1 unpopular Rocky movie.

Lmao Francesa talking about the Rocky movies. "FAWR WAS DA WORST MOVIE I'VE EVAH SEEN! JEW LIKED DAT GAWBIJ? "
I am captivated by Francesa talking Rocky. He just called Rocky IV the worst movie ever made. No one does radio like this. The King.
The movie Rocky except Steve Bushemi is Rocky.

A new Rocky movie, a new Star Wars movie AND a @springsteen tour?! There has never been a greater time to be a fanboy
I'm going to start a spin studio that inspires motivation with super bass heavy club music and Rocky movie training montages.
"Creed" is the 2nd best Rocky movie & one could argue that it's even better than part 1. Stallone's best performance ever. Go see it. #Creed
@ExpertZone @meowbertsenpai My cousin & I can A cappella the whole Rocky 4 soundtrack for you. All of us in Philly worship a movie character
@Keelime_ Wait until you get to Rocky IV. Masterpiece that movie is.
Iv watched every Rocky movie with my dad, only fitting we go see CREED together too
Creed felt like a drama when it needed to, a fresh boxing movie, final fight like watching a vintage Rocky movie
That #creed movie is too bad we won't have five sequels to it like rocky cuz the lead actor is black beating white dudes up
This Michael Jackson movie where Flex Alexander is playing him
Creed looks like it's a great movie and I'm not just saying that because Rocky Balboa is in it
3 things the new Rocky movie #Creed don't have 1 - a World champion with muscles 2 - A theme song instantly recognizable 3 -realistic fights
Lmao bout to watch every rocky movie all over again just to re watch creed.

Saw Creed and it's my new favorite movie, it's incredible. It gave me all types emotions#creed #rocky #boxing #loveboxing #excited
dear netflix, just because i watched rocky last weekend doesn't mean i want to watch every single sylvester stallone movie
watched the new rocky last nite. what a movie. Goodison park for the main fight lol
CREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!! What a movie. If you're 35+ and a Rocky fan, that film will break you in two. SO good. SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!! #CREED
Creed was pretty good, rocky 1 rehashed pretty much. Not the best but its a rocky movie what more can ya ask for

My brother is very passionate about the new Rocky movie
Do I have to watch the Rocky movies to understand CREED??? I wanna see this movie but never watched Rocky
Just watched Creed.. great movie.. brought back alot of memories!! ROCKY FTW!!!!!!!!
4:15 AM: downloading every rocky movie
@SlopesGameRoom One of the greatest movies known to man. And that ain't Chuck, it's Barry Bostwick from Rocky Horror in an action movie.
I didn't pay to go see rocky so that's a good thing in my opinion it's on it's own two feet and it's a great fucking movie
Saw Creed and it's an amazing movie very emotional incredible performances by the whole cast and honestly it doesn't live up to rocky but
"Rocky III" is underrated though. Decades of being a pop culture punchline can't change how terrifying Mr. T is in that movie.
Watched Southpaw on the plane. What a fantastic movie. 100 times better than rocky. I may have cried. #Oscars2016
Rocky is a guy who can't win. That's the whole point of his movie. Giving him a sequel where he does win feels like a copout.
Creed was a really good movie I cried when Rocky Balboa found out he had cancer he remind me of my stepdad ....Italian and all
It wouldn't be a Rocky movie without a couple of good one liners. So far so good.
Creed was a decent movie, definitely entertaining. But the story was too predictable, basically same story as the first Rocky movie.
@kiranpreetgill Finally watching the movie Creed after watching 4 Rocky films this past week to know the story beforehand.
It took until the last 15 minutes of Rocky 3 for a Rocky movie to have an actual good boxing scene
I like to think of my life as a Rocky movie, specifically Rocky IV. And Life is Ivan Drago while I'm Apollo Creed.

"Creed" was a GREAT movie, I've seen ALL the "Rocky" Movies so it was only right..
I'd say "Creed" was better than the last Rocky movie.
The new Rocky movie looks awesome saw a preview of it last night
Creed is a fantastic movie. You don’t even have to watch Rocky to enjoy it. Well written, brilliantly acted.

I feel sorry for whoever creates a boxing movie because it will always be compared to Rocky, and will never be as good as Rocky.
Which is the best rocky movie?
#CreedMovie is superb . Best rocky movie since the first - and as entertaining as 3 or 4 .
wow #creed was a great movie and torch passing for #rocky
@ColtraneIII @Russian_Blossom the last Rocky movie was actually good, so I'll see it
@crossed_sabres @Russian_Blossom Creed is the new Rocky movie lol, its amazing, it has like 95% on Rotten Tomatoes
Rocky III is probably the greatest movie ever made
I liked a YouTube video http://youtu.be/8tab8fK2_3w?a  Rocky Balboa Official Trailer #1 - Sylvester Stallone, Burt Young Movie (2006) HD

I'd go as far to say that creed is the best rocky movie yet
Today I decided to go see "CREED". After 40 years, @TheSlyStallone still captures the hearts of Rocky fans in the movie. Tissues were used.

@adancanto @creedmovie of course! it's a Rocky movie! I will cry if it's for the reason I think it is. haven't seen it yet. #CreedMovie
@realraysanchez @creedmovie @TonyBellew @danrafaelespn good movie but nothin like Rocky 2,3 or 4. Those characters were REAL LIFE heroes
I can't write a reasonable review of Rocky. It was simply the best movie I've seen.
In celebration of the new Rocky movie @creedmovie we present out remix of "EYE OF THE TIGER" https://soundcloud.com/getbusy/survivor-eye-of-the-tiger-get-busy-remix … #melbournebounce #Rocky
How much $ did they pay Robert DiNero to do the dumbass Rocky and Bullwinkle movie that he starred in?
CREED is the best movie of the Rocky series! If you haven't seen it you are missing out.
The new Rocky movie Creed is AMAZING! They really couldn't have made it any better! Beautiful! I'm in tears! WATCH THIS MOVIE!
'Creed' is the first Rocky movie post-'Rocky' to really 'get' why 'Rocky' was such a powerful movie.
Rocky 3 gets a 3.75/5 from me. Really awesome movie. Hits the beats well, just not outstanding like Rocky or Creed do.
Creed is the best Rocky movie out since the original Rocky.
My full interview w/ #Creed writer/director #RyanCoogler https://youtu.be/kG70ygJfWzw  #Rocky #boxing #Movie #michaelbjordan #SylvesterStallone
Just saw the movie Creed.. Not going to lie it might be the BEST movie in the Rocky series
How could you never have seen a #Rocky movie? The first will always be the best https://twitter.com/cmpunk/status/672186934148521984 …
I'm curious to know which movie is people's favorite Rocky movie.
United Artists offered Stallone up to US$340,000 to sell them the rights to Rocky if he agreed to not star in the movie. FACT He refused
@chase_116 @CalebAlecz it was on my to do list cause I've seen every rocky movie
@Lodizzle09 @ah_5_ no he said lets not forget the greatness of this movie/trilogy. Theres 6 rocky movies
Besides the movie Rocky 4 you have no proof Ant https://twitter.com/antevansufc/status/672209297070096384 …
Everyone's posting about seeing Creed and I'm all like " Is that shitty band trying to make a comeback?" Then I realized it's a Rocky movie!
First day out in the truck was great and taxing at the same time. Gaining some renewed inspiration from the best movie of all time. Rocky IV
I swear Creed makes me want to re-watch every Rocky movie.....Rocky movies and Chill?
Rocky Horror Picture Show > Any Christmas Movie
This is my favorite Rocky movie. Watching this clip brings back memories. Can't wait to see Creed… https://www.instagram.com/p/-0BRFxMmxp/ 
If you like the original Rocky movie, than you'll love Creed 100%
Damn I feel pumped after seeing Creed. Possibly the best Rocky movie.
Just saw "Creed" and was very impressed. If you love "Rocky" you're gonna love this movie. It's great even if you don't know Rocky's story.

I wanna see Creed so bad because Rocky is my all time favorite movie
FOX11 news anchor marlatellez enjoyed the movie #creed #rocky https://www.instagram.com/p/-zfC24qCtW/ 
Rocky IV was without a doubt the best Rocky movie
Idc. Make as many Rocky spinoffs as you want. It's a classic movie. But the day Philly stops being involved, I'll never watch again.
"Creed" is an EXCELLENT movie. On par with Rocky I, II, III IV. If you aren't moved by it, you have no heart and no soul. #CreedMovie
It was the BEST movie in Rocky franchise. RT @CHYnese_: ‘CREED’ Becomes Highest Grossing Opening In ‘Rocky’ Franchise.

So yes the movie Creed is really good and Rocky is back to being Rocky and Michael B. Jordan is amazing
Just got two film festival submission replies that started with "regretfully". I think that means it's time to put on a Rocky movie.

they say Creed was the best rocky movie since the first rocky.... false
Two items. 1. I tried to cut my own hair last night and it didn't end well. 2. The first Rocky movie I've ever seen was CREED.
I dreamt I saw the movie #Creed & they kept ringing a bell so much #Rocky couldn't concentrate. Then I woke up thirsty & craved an ice tea.
@heartcatchr it is a new movie in the Rocky (like the boxer) franchise that is getting amazing reviews
@DaveHendrick_AI its great. whether you are a rocky fan or not its just a really good movie.
@5xNatl_Champs @Alf954 @Lauzin @creedmovie Yes but I’ve watched every Rocky movie the fight scenes in Creed are the best by far.
Finally got to watching Rocky. Movie had more going in it than I thought.
Creed - One of the best Rocky movies. And it IS a Rocky movie. Haven't heard a theater audience cheer like that since Fast & Furious 6. #fb
For a movie about boxing, #CreedMovie had some lil heartfelts mixed in. It's fun & ... I teared up more than once... Yup #toughguy #Rocky

Michael B Jordan was pretty good, but Sly made that movie awesome with the subtle Rocky references and jokes as an old man

Was a worthy successor to the Rocky movies without trying to be a Rocky movie.
Watching Creed and so far this movie is dope. It makes me want to watch all the Rocky movies all over. Exclude the last one though LOL
@Eli_cuts yeah! Donny creed is Apollo's son The movie should tell how he goes to look for rocky
@TheBryPie great movie that pays tribute to the original Rocky and Michael B Jordan was excellent as Creed
Creed hitting people with them feels and realistic looking right and left hooks. Worth a watch even if you haven't seen a Rocky movie.

H: he said that #CreedMovie made him tear up a bit, I wonder why. M: it's a Rocky movie, those are like Lifetime movies for men
I've never seen one rocky movie so how am I suppose to see creed?
Creed was a good ass movie, then the sound went out at the end I'll never know what inspirational words Rocky said to him!!!
I've never seen a Rocky movie and I'm going to see Creed rn. LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS

Creed is the best rocky movie ever
My day was good, watched the last rocky movie and it was actually good
@SamRS72 then see it--however don't be too overhyped. It's still very formulaic. It's good at the formula, but still a Rocky movie.
why would someone i work with recommend i go see some new rocky movie why is there a new rocky movie don't they know me by now
@chevychevelle48 @JLee418 @chris29fan @43324FAN just saw CREED great movie gotta love Rocky
I liked a @YouTube video from @thepopcorntalk http://youtu.be/Cu5MbswpnWg?a  Rocky IV… is a “Guilty Movie Pleasure”
This week just keeps on dragging me down.. I need chocolate and a Rocky movie marathon...
I hope they make another Rocky movie called 'Lang',where the young boxer has a BA=bad attitude. #Creed. #CreedMovie
@ClarystaInSun I'm hearing great things. I know I'll come out ready to push a bus. Every time I seen a rocky movie the theater cheered
Uhh. Rocky 6 is.... a really good movie... I may have shed tears.
ii agreeee! RT @NonyeTruu: I think the movie "Creed" was our generation of "Rocky" I loved it #GreatMessageForMe
My new bit is going to be replying with Creed (the band) songs to every tweet that pops up on my timeline about Creed (the Rocky movie).
The 'Rocky' movie franchise. That and more in today's Hollywood Buzz podcast! http://bit.ly/1PsIHnc 
Totally forgot to tweet about how incredible #Creed was. Stellar movie, awesome cast. Great follow up to the Rocky movies.
Creed was a dope ass movie...the Rocky spin off was tight
#Creed is just as good as everyone is saying. Maybe better. It's tough but this might be my favorite Rocky movie. It's that good people.
Can we have a chapter wide movie night with Rocky IV to motivate us for finals? @WKUSPE

Can't wait for CREED to hit the cinema @curatebyo Rocky is one of the greatest stories of the human condition & movie franchises ever
Did you really watch the new Rocky movie if you didn't go for a midnight run after?
#CREED was definitely on par with the first Rocky. Great movie
Rocky is the greatest movie series ever
@Tmoser5 seriously...not just the best Rocky movie, but one of the best overall movies in recent memory.
Creed was such a good movie, brought back so many child hood memories watching Rocky Balboa
ASAP Rocky in the movie dope
@reihan Probably. As I said, I am horrible in terms of a movie criticism. We can all of course agree Rocky V was horrible.
So Creed. Damn good movie. I highly recommend for it anyone that loved the old Rocky movies. It's got a lot of spirit and makes its own name
I'm callin it, they're gonna make another movie about Apollo Creed's son but Rocky's son is gonna get into boxing and they're gonna fight.
Watched #CREED tonight with my boi. Movie was so good. Our generation needs a new "Rocky" series and this is the one to do it! #FiveStars
Just saw #Creed. Fantastic. @michaelb4jordan killed it. This is the Rocky movie for my generation. And I love the originals. Go see it.
I can't get over how good that movie was. For a millennial who's loved the Rocky franchise, it's an all timer.
People saying Creed best Rocky movie since the first? IMO Rocky Rocky II Creed Rocky IV Rocky III
I would see an EXPENDABLES type movie starring the outcasts of the Rocky universe: Tommy Gunn, Steps, Paulie's Robot, Tony Kornheiser
I'm a Rocky fan so this movie made happy
Rocky will always be a good movie.
Creed was the best Rocky movie I've seen. IMO. Rocky I was good but they directed this movie so good.
@ODimonda personally it's my favorite movie starring rocky
Alright, I may have gotten teary eyed from watching the new movie Creed. Go watch it! But watch the first six Rocky movies first!
If you ever want to watch the movie Rocky, just watch @MinuteMatt1 snapchat story
So @doesntmattr was sitting in front of a couple where the dude had never seen a Rocky movie or a boxing match.
I have never seen the original Rocky but damn. Creed is an amazing movie. Gotta see those movies soon.

@jnoug13 tbh I don't know what he is tripping about the acting in the movie is great hope you enjoy it man it feels like a rocky movie
I thought Creed was pretty much like any other Rocky movie.... Super motivational with lots of workout montages
@Torrr06_xo Asap Rocky is my favorite character in that movie

The next Rocky movie will be called Rocky Road and it's just 2hrs of Sylvester Stallone eating ice cream on his couch
The makers of 'Creed' showed more restraint than I would've in not asking A.S.A.P. Rocky to record a song for the movie.
I roasted Brennan in Geometry when he said he has seen all the Rocky movies. He couldn't even name who Rocky fought in the third movie.

@itsChampJohnson AND I love that it didn't feel like "a black version of Rocky" it was a damn good movie with a black lead character
as the biggest rocky fan ever, i can say the new movie was honestly the best #intears
The training montage in Creed is the best in any Rocky movie outside of Rocky III.
I liked a @YouTube video from @screenslam http://youtu.be/xMwSrrCalrs?a  Creed: Sylvester Stallone "Rocky Balboa" Behind the Scenes Movie
Wow! Creed needs to get a nom from @TheAcademy the movie is just as good as Rocky. Pleasant surprise.
True facts: I absolutely LOVE the Rocky Horror Picture Show score but can't stand the movie.
Creed is a powerful + amazing movie. Sly Stallone takes Rocky character to very new + emotional places. Michael B Jordan tremendous as well.
Ive watched every single rocky movie + creed in the past 3 days and now i want to fight everything i see #squareuphoe

CREED was everything a Rocky movie should be. **Spoiler Alert** Rocky makes it to the top of the Philadelphia Museum steps one last time.
Currently marathoning Rocky in honor of Creed, and even though I know how they end I am still yelling in my room at the movie
Naw. I too, never watched a moment of a rocky movie but that thang solid. https://twitter.com/birds_word/status/671396436198731777 …

Creed is easily the best Rocky movie since Rocky.
Edelstein: It is a Rocky movie and it isn't a Rocky movie.
@KarthikKakarala I mean, Balboa was a movie that deconstructed Rocky's legacy, destroyed it, but left him fulfilled. That was something.
Creed was a really good movie, made me laugh made me cry. You'll only appreciate it if you've actually watched the rocky movies though
Meh - not quite. In Rocky, Adrian begins the movie quiet and timid. And by the end she has agency, makes decisions. https://twitter.com/JeffJSays/status/671395255174983680 …
Thought the new Creed movie was based on a true story... Guess I should go watch Rocky

. @EdgeofSports @thenation GREAT piece on #Creed. Thanks for writing this! You're right: it isn't a Rocky movie, it's a Ryan Coogler movie.
Creed was also a fantastic movie. Y'all need to go back and watch all the Rocky's though cause those are the

@theactivestick I believe I saw someone tweet last night that it works as both a stand-alone movie and as part of the Rocky series.

@TheNumberNine y'all thought I was joking about that movie day #Rocky pic.twitter.com/2wyvwaopa4
You could then have Lang and Gunn with the same formula. Followed by Rocky Assembles bringing all the fighters sons into one movie.
And if you need a point of reference look at the first Rocky. Bianca had way more going on than Adrian ever did in the first movie. #CREED

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MwPb7g_BlXQ … there will never be a movie scene ever that can get me as hype as this does @TheSlyStallone #ROCKY #YouCantWin
. @b_youngman just asked me what my favorite Christmas movie was. Die Hard. There is no other answer (other than Rocky IV).
didn't realize Creed was a Rocky movie til now. oops. i've only seen the first one a while ago so it didn't click.
I don't know why, just the thought of a new rocky movie out and Star Wars coming, the 80s are coming back
With Rocky being on the big screen again in #CREED, it makes me really want to see one last Rambo movie. Hope @TheSlyStallone agrees with me
'Creed' has second-biggest box office opening ever for a 'Rocky' movie http://buff.ly/1l0ASrY

I hope someday... maybe the guy that lived by Rocky, his cousin or friend from college can get a movie too. #Spinoffs
@sarahdaviscc so did I. I read a similar critique of the American Dream is in The first Rocky movie. Right down to Apollo's boxing trunks.
Out of all the movies out there the movie that is the most patriotic is hands down Rocky 4....
Creed is a follow up to Rocky Balboa and is definitely a good motivational movie. (:
Just got out of #Creed and that was great movie and can't wait to add it to the Rocky collection #rockybalboa

Having a Rocky marathon at the moment! What's your favourite Rocky movie?
ASAP rocky really did a good job in that movie
speechless, #Creed was amazing, might be my new favorite movie of the year & even rank it up there with Rocky everyone needs to go see this!
On one part of the movie I was so close to crying all the Rocky movies were all coming together like ugh got me in the feels so good
Saw Creed today (the movie not the band) now time to settle down and watch every Rocky movie. Popcorn anyone?
I don't care if you haven't seen a Rocky and neither does this movie. Go see Creed immediately.
Creed is the real deal. So nice to see a great Rocky movie again.
I #love the #art #work and #advertisement of the #Creed posters also a great #movie #Rocky pic.twitter.com/vnkUadagWE
Creed was pretty good. Doesn't compare to no rocky movie but it was alright

The movie Creed was good and all, but nothing ever beats Rocky
watching the first rocky movie for the 15,000 time
No joke Creed is the perfect modernized Rocky, there are MULTIPLE scenes in that movie that are as iconic and powerful as the whole series
I've seen every Rocky movie 6293725 times!!!
You don't understand how emotional I get about Rocky films. The first may be a perfect movie. That said, Creed was phenomenal.
Creed is the blackest Rocky movie there is, and I love it. 7.5/10 #movie #review #dirtbike #2pac MBJ repped!
So many people on my TL praising #CREED , can't wait to see it. Has a lot to live upto, as believe it or not #Rocky won a best movie #oscar
creed is a dope movie. if you like rocky this is a must see
In a span of two days, I came to enjoy #GoneWithTheWind and @sarahparga came to enjoy a Rocky movie. We're ready to get married.

"Creed" is easily the best Rocky movie since 2. See it.
Creed was a great movie. A must see especially if you where a fan of the Rocky series.
@Veronica I hear it's the beginning of a trilogy? I've also heard it's the best Rocky movie since the original.
Picked the wrong time to go see #Creed I'm n here doin push-ups shadow boxing. Good movie. I need to sit down. That #rocky music gets ya.
Absolutely Loved This Movie! Rocky 7 Baby!!! http://fb.me/7smRaLHUv 
I really, really, really liked Creed. I'll never not love a movie that has Rocky in it. I cried so hard when Apollo Creed died in Rocky IV.
Rocky IV is the greatest movie of all time
Donny also had his own theme music that was different enough from "Gunna Fly Now" but still sounded like it belonged in a Rocky movie
If you haven't seen @TheSlyStallone 's new movie CREED, the latest "Rocky" movie I highly recommend!What an amazing job, and ode to original

Rocky is still wearing that damn fedora in the new movie?
Michael B Jordan and Sly Stallone are incredible in the movie Creed! Such a great movie. Don't even have to be a Rocky fan but it helps!
People who saw Creed prolly never saw Rocky 1-4 and you were prolly lost through out the movie.
Rocky Movie Review & Film Summary (1976) | Roger Ebert http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rocky-1976 … -- Ebert compara a Stallone con Marlon Brando, era 1976.
I may be slightly biased because I went in already thinking that Rocky movies are the best movie franchise of all time but whatever
From the time I was a kid to now. I've probably seen every Rocky movie over 100 times. @creedmovie CREED... a new classic.
The original ROCKY is magnificent, and Paulie is a literal trashbag with a frown drawn on it. Everybody in this movie is in a bad mood.
Saw the movie #Creed tonight. Loved it, I recommend it to all Rocky fans!
"Grown men cried watching the new Rocky movie" pic.twitter.com/u0Na6cfUMu
Creed was a good movie . I feel like in the next movie or 2 Rocky will eventually die from his cancer...
Well, I just saw #Creed. It is, in fact, a #Rocky movie. I was wrong.
SPOILER: ghost Obi Wan says "run, [character], run" at least twenty times in the new Rocky movie. Very disorienting.
Just saw CREED tonight with the fam, and it works equally well as a Rocky movie and as its own thing. Will probably write a few words on it.
@jowrotethis it's a great movie. Even with the scene in Rocky's apartment that gets kinda uncomfortable.
@HotelScallywag @artiequitter FYI, Paulie is dead in the new Rocky 7 movie a/k/a Creed
Creed was a fantastic movie. Rocky is still a fantastic character and fighter. pic.twitter.com/tVuS6SXVVb
Watching ROCKY for the first time and it's kind of incredible how much I know about this movie just through pop culture osmosis.
#CREED is legit. Favorite Balboa movie next to Rocky IV.
@Uptomyknees wait is the new "Rocky Babies" movie actually good?
Saw #Creed this weekend. Most excellent movie and motivational. Classic Rocky style! https://twitter.com/dougshiloh/status/671049407647916032 …
Brandy Tims let me go see the new ROCKY movie and I come home to all the Christmas decor done!! She is the best!! Great job babe.
@thesuperrookie @cdelinks hands down the best rocky themed movie since 3/4 (that's a really low bar) but was great.
Sylvester Stallone was so broke before the Rocky movie that he had to sell his dog! WOW! #truestory #yourtimeiscoming
Creed was a good ass movie I hope they do like rocky
So glad I rewatched all the Rocky movies this weekend and saw Creed in theaters. Awesome movie
Cliches (oh, the training montages!) run amok in #Creed, the latest "Rocky" movie. http://bit.ly/21kmOtS  pic.twitter.com/Jfb1QkSTfZ
Badass movie, great addition to the rocky saga probably watch it again #CREED #Rocky
@MrMitchell_6 @RossDodds10 also rocky did lose to Apollo in the very first movie
@TYBJvy go watch that bro is good and I think I watched like one rocky movie lol
Hope the Creed movie is about Scott Stapp turning black and becoming a boxing rapper and rocky is his hype man and he's Jewish.. not Italian
Just saw the new (yes I'll say it) ROCKY movie, "CREED". It was so good!! @BradLimes @da_jesselimes pic.twitter.com/T9JRfNldze
@Felonious_munk The best movie I've seen in a long time. I grew up w/ the Rocky franchise. This was equal if not better. @michaelb4jordan
Creed was one heck of a movie! Rocky Balboa will always be one of my favorites
#CreedMovie was so worth watching If you like Rocky you will definitely enjoy this Awesome Movie. #TwoThumbsUp pic.twitter.com/3QqeAFVea1
@cameronmcc211 Rocky no that was legit the best movie ever
I'm beyond PUMPED to be seeing Creed tonight. Rocky will forever be my favorite movie series of all time #Rocky pic.twitter.com/CV80Dem30l
Yes: in ROCKY IV, as a ridiculously cheesy song plays, Stallone has a lengthy flashback *to the movie we are already watching.*
Idc if you've never seen a Rocky movie. Go see Creed.
How to watch the Rocky movie series: Rocky 1, 2 & 6. Rocky 3, 4 & 5 are for when you're bored and have the time.
I feel like most of the people that said creed was the best movie they've ever seen haven't watched the original 6 rocky movies
I have GOT to see the new Rocky movie!
I watched every Rocky movie today and I am not ashamed
It's possible that Creed is the best movie I've seen this year. Is this what our parents felt seeing Rocky for the first time? Good grief.

All seriousness, Creed (7th Rocky movie) is the best and most emotional film I’ve seen all year. It’s fantastic. Go see it.
#Creed was a fantastic movie! @michaelb4jordan was amazing & Sylvester Stallone will probably win an Oscar. Great spin off the Rocky movies!

Rocky IV rewrite: Rocky runs to the top of the mountain in the training montage and the rest of the movie is him finding his way home.
So CREED was a very excellent movie. It had all the parts of a classic movie just like ROCKY. #twothumbsup #creed
Now movie blogs are saying Creed's box office numbers are solely based on Rocky's popularity. #False
Creed is the best Rocky movie by far.
'Creed' has second-biggest box office opening ever for a 'Rocky' movie http://dlvr.it/Ct3YV4 
If The Force Awakens is to A New Hope as Creed is to Rocky 1, then it will be a fantastic movie.
@fit_with_hips aha ya! I was confused too. It's the new rocky movie I guess
not a fan of long movie franchises but The Rocky franchise has held up #Creed was very good Michael B is believable & cinematography is Dope
@blondefighter top-3 rocky movie, in my opinion!
You know, Rocky might be the most consistently watchable movie series to make it to 7. ROCKY V is the only real stinker, but the others...
You know shit about to get real in a Rocky movie when Gonna Fly Now starts .
Saw the movie Creed this weekend. Better than I expected. It's somewhat predictable, but still a good story. 2up. #Rocky

@CinemaSquared Haha As every Rocky movie an Creed is.
I kind of love Rocky. The character, not the movie. The movie is fine too but I'm just talking about the character though
@thecrapulent #Creed is the 3rd best movie after Rocky 1 and 2. 3 is still by far the funniest tho

I haven't cried that much during a movie in a long time. Creed wrecked me. In a good way. The Rocky/Creed legacy lives on. #Creed
#Creed is not only a great addition to the Rocky series, it's a terrific movie in general. So much to like. Great to see Philly again, too!
Creed was a great movie. Felt like I was watching Rocky I for the first time again. Must see for any Rocky fans and also non Rocky fans
Honestly every Rocky movie is amazing and Creed definitely did not disappoint

I guess I'm going to see Creed. Won't act like I'm not a suckered for a Rocky movie anyway. Checking local theaters.
Creed was a good ass movie. I wish some parts of the story were more developed but they tied in enough Rocky stuff & didn't force the end
Creed was good movie. Some funny Rocky moments if you love the old movies. Best part by far was Michael B. Jordan, who was awesome.

'Creed' a great ' #Rocky' movie | 16 http://goo.gl/fb/fZLxtC 
"Rocky" gets all the credit for a movie about Chuck Wepner's life.
Philadelphia showed a lot of love for "Creed," the latest movie in the "Rocky" saga. https://www.inside.com/movies/u6ztp/Philadelphia-showed-a-lot-of-love-for-Creed-?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=twitterhandle&utm_campaign=@GetInsideMovies … #news pic.twitter.com/G3zdpAfMd0

If you don't get motivated after watching a Rocky movie, do you really ever get motivated by anything?
I might be the only person in the world who hasn't seen even 1 rocky movie
Just saw "Creed," and it's the best "Rocky" movie since the first one. I give it 4 1/2 stars.
Creed's got the goods...and yes, it is the best Rocky movie since 1976.
I wanna say Creed is my 3rd or 4th favorite movie in the Rocky series.
So when I put my mom on blast the other day about wanting to see "creed" together, she wanted to see the new rocky movie, not the band.
Creed is the best movie I've seen in a while. Probably the 3rd or 4th best movie in the Rocky franchise.
TERRIFIC MOVIE: Review: In ‘Creed,’ Rocky’s Back, as a Mentor, Not a Fighter #Creed http://nyti.ms/1QGrJSf

CREED. Phenomenal movie. Ding ding. #creed #rocky https://instagram.com/p/-r2D_HRspN/ 
Creed was an incredible movie. I definitely recommend seeing it but please watch the Rocky series first :)
It easily makes top 5 best of the year and if you love Rocky, see this movie as soon as you can! #CreedMovie
@TheSlyStallone just watched the first Rocky movie. It was amazing. @SteveSimeone another Philly hero recommended it. You guys shld b frnds.

Just got out of seeing "Creed" A fantastic Rocky movie. A love letter to the franchise and a great film in its own right. #creedmovie #rocky
I want a movie similar to Creed/Rocky, but it's about Chessboxing
Creed is a great movie. It answered a great Rocky mystery and also left a lot unanswered. I'd expect the series to continue
Thanks to from @KristianHarloff & @5150ellis I saw Creed, my 1st Rocky movie. It was fantastic & husband was happy I wanted to see it.
#Creed was amazing! Like the best parts of all the Rocky movies in ONE movie. I'll see it again

Seeing creed makes me wish I had the time go rewatch every rocky movie created
Just saw The movie Creed!! AMAZING!Still can’t believe Rocky reveals winner of 3rd Balboa-Creed fight. 1 of life’s great mysteries revealed
What a movie Creed was.. Goes to show you how monumental Rocky and Sly were and still are. Oscars? @creedmovie
@urgirlkeke it was really good lol I had no idea it was a rocky movie
They better go talk about the Rocky movie https://twitter.com/j0ymadden/status/671075850821963776 …
Creed was a dope ass movie, man. I love how they built the relationship with him and Rocky
@Rschooley Rocky was the first movie that I saw in a theater that showed places I'd actually been. It was mind blowing.
@TheSlyStallone just saw 'Creed', it was excellent and took me back to when I saw Rocky as a kid. An unexpected gem of a movie!
Creed is really as good as they're saying. Great movie in its own right but truly honored the Rocky series and the city of Philadelphia.
There are 2 movie marathons I need to have ASAP. #Rocky & #StarWars but which do I start first? https://twitter.com/eonline/status/671069537018765312 …
4) It was good with the caveat that it's a Rocky movie.
#Creed is a solid movie, y'all. If the Rocky series ends here, it ends on a high note.
everyone should see a Rocky movie in a Philadelphia theater before they die
I watched the original Rocky movie to get some inspiration in my life, but all it did was inspire me to watch the other 6 Rocky movies.
just watched the new rocky movie and I need to fight someone asap
"Ronda's in the middle of a real movie. Rocky III. Holly Holm is Clubber Lang." @eddiebravo Alternate ending: Clubber wins the rematch too.
Nothing this year has put a bigger smile on my face than the moment they played the main Rocky theme in #Creed. Great boxing movie!
My dad starts crying during Creed and goes "I'm sorry I cry in every rocky movie"
Bout to watch #CreedMovie. Been a Rocky movie fan forever, hope it's good!
Pleasantly surprised. I was ready to pick this movie apart b/c I've seen ALL the rocky movies ♡. Loved this... http://fb.me/30lb5k0Eu 
Creed was a pretty good movie, but you need to watch the Rocky movies before you watch it.

Has a Rocky movie ever flopped? Nope. Even the sixth one did well.
In 1982 Rocky went full 80's and fought both Hulk Hogan AND Mr. T in the same movie. Apparently Max Headroom was unavailable.
I'm herein that Sylvester Stallone's new movie Creed is awesome gettin great reviews in america what agreat movie it is rite next to Rocky

The truth is I'd see any Rocky movie. Let's do this, Creed. Bring the feels.
#Creed was a real good movie. Had some Rocky elements to it as expected but it stood up on its own. Michael B Jordan did his thing!
Creed was a phenomenal movie. 12/10 would recommend especially if you're a rocky fan.
#Creed is as great of a movie as the band is shitty. #Rocky
@phat_boy4 best rocky series movie yet
Immensely fun and possibly the best Rocky movie since the original Rocky.Coogler and Jordan hit it out of the park. #CreedMovie

@BdukeKing Loved it. 2nd best movie in the Rocky series behind only the first one
Creed is a really good movie. No prior knowledge of the Rocky series necessary - which helped my son.
I went to see "Creed" on Friday morning & I must say that it was fantastic. Every bit as good as any previous Rocky movie. #Creed #Rocky
Creed was areally good movie. I don't know the back story though because I've never seen any of the Rocky movies.
I've seen every Rocky movie there is... I'd love to see Creed before its not in theaters anymore
Watching Rocky 4...there's a robot.... There's a robot in a Rocky movie. Okay.

@TheSnortingBull From the reviews it looks to be a good movie. I've always liked the Rocky movies, so I'd like to see it.
@ColineDottin YAAAS! All Day, Everyday !! We should totally have a movie night with Rocky HPS. and Mean Girls !! :-D
Did you see CREED this weekend ? Great holiday movie. If you grew up with Rocky it takes you back. And the other... http://fb.me/7t5pqoqLG 
Saw Creed last night. Excellent movie not sure why people are surprised the first one did win best picture, but they did also make rocky V
Creed and Rocky follow very similar story arcs, but I'm ok with that. Creed feels like the right movie for the time.
The movie is sad and funny in all the right spots. I think it fits perfectly into the Rocky world.
'Creed' is apparently the 7th 'Rocky' movie, but I'm pretty sure it was 'Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge'

I stand by my opinion that Rocky IV is the best Christmas movie.
Just finished watching the original Rocky movie. Now I know why it got nominated for 10 Oscars. Dat sweet romantic ending T_T
In the theater before CREED. Realizing that quite possibly this is the first "Rocky" movie I've seen in the theater since ROCKY IV in 1985.
a guy on my fb feed said "saw Creed tonight! it was awesome!" & everyone commenting thinks it was the band and not that new Rocky movie lol
We watched the fourth Rocky movie and I am considerably less hype.

MockingJay Part 2 was such a nice movie, can't wait to watch the new Rocky movie though!
Creed was sooooo good. Also, I like to think that Skyfall is the only movie Rocky owns.
2. "Creed" was a gift to all of us Rocky fans. Perfect movie. You feel every emotion and it's not predictable. @michaelb4jordan is a STAR.

It may not have been as good as the first Rocky movie, but Creed was still pretty damn good.
@savoythegreat I've never seen a Rocky movie. I know Apollo Creed died...maybe fighting a Russian. Do I need to see them 1st?
Almost teared up last night watching that movie. The Rocky's know how to pull at your heartstrings. Especially knowing the back history
@MVCMensLax damn autocorrect, avatar isn't a rocky movie! My fav Rocky movie is def rocky VI
Fam...understsand: His name is Ryan Coogler. Mr. Coogler wrote the black INTO a Rocky movie agressively & almost killed Rocky with CANCER!
Ryan Coogler did it again. 'Creed' was amazing. Easily third best Rocky movie, or it's tied for second best with Rocky IV.
I'm a big Rocky movie fan since l was a kid ...seen Creed last night and it falls in place with one… https://instagram.com/p/-rBoPEizk4/

@robinwhitney I actually love Rocky IV. Whole movie is like that. James Brown is in it. Half of it is montages. It's amazing.
Just finished watching the #Apollo and #Rocky fight movie. Awesome. @ Alexandra VA. https://instagram.com/p/-qcAzGqfo-/ 
Creed feels like a rocky movie but with its own touch. I loved it too damn much.
Creed is fckn amazing. It's like they took the best parts of rocky and made it into one movie but still feel like it's own movie.
I watched every single Rocky movie today & now I have nothing to do with my life again
If #CREED gets nominated for a bunch of film awards, they will be just as well deserved as the love it's getting from movie fans. #Rocky
Im on my like 4th rocky movie now lol
This Rocky movie has me all motivated and shit
Rocky Balboa is everything to me. Okay. I'm not okay this movie gets to me.

Creed was so good. So I guess we kind of did need another rocky movie.

I've watched two horrible Christmas movies, and then every Rocky movie. Yeppp. Stay tuned for thy reviews on thy podcast sooooon.
Creed was a religious experience. (Rocky movie, not band.)
Creed is the best boxing movie next the Rocky series of course
I've never seen a Rocky movie but I'd consider seeing Creed just for Michael B. Jordan's teeth. how much screen time do his teef get??
Ok seen creed! and everybody that say that movie aint good must not have the slightest knowledge on the Rocky movies.
#CreedMovie is the best movie made this year! #ApolloCreedsSon #MichaleBJordan #Rocky
Saw creed tonight and it was such a great movie & if you've seen the rocky movies it just makes it so much more emotional. Great movie!
@Bigtexlex @aguirre_katiee agreed okay any Individual rocky movie or Good Fellas. I watched rocky again btw.

Watching every Rocky movie tonight couse it's been a while.
#Creed is the best boxing movie of our generation. Has every element of a Rocky film. This one sits up there with the original. Best of 2015
@allie_osh You HAVE to see the new Rocky ...... CREED. It's a great movie!
@DarthGeekonius the way #Creed takes the theme of a rocky movie and transitions it both in story, soundtrack, and setting.
