the prestige movie is very impressive. Christopher shoots his plot twist right in the ending when everything falls into place and unexpected
I think one of the finest movie out there would be The Prestige. Storyline dia thorrrrbaikkk.

@framelessfilm Tbh it'll be interesting to follow it at the box office. The Prestige suffered bc of similar movie conceits, but not all have
The Prestige made much less than The Illusionist bc ppl thought it was the same magician movie again. The Martian feels like a retread.

@Drew_Kiess That being said, THE PRESTIGE is still my favorite Nolan movie and I love Batman more than any fictional character.
"The Prestige" (2006) is a recommended movie (B) #AhiMovieReviews <nuoqhl>
I have never seen a movie that improves on repeat viewings as much as The Prestige does. Every line of it has renewed significance. SO good
The Prestige really is the best Christopher Nolan movie. like, kind of by a landslide
@NoxVoyager I watch at least one movie alone on a monthly basis. It's my version of having a spa day! Also I saw The Prestige alone haaaaah

@SauronsBANE I love how it's such a big deal when Bowie does a movie. Very Daniel Day-Lewis like! His last role was The Prestige...? Hmmmm
@TEANTACLES I think The Prestige is the most Nolan movie of them all. They are big magic tricks that you shouldn't try to inspect.
The Prestige is at least an 8/10, great movie
Went from Frozen to The Departed to The Prestige to this Addicted movie..........slick boring me lmao some need to happen
The Prestige just blasted to the top of my fav movie list. So good, really just a MAGICAL experience. #illbehereallweek #isheeventryingnow?
New Christopher Nolan movie out in 2017. His films are hit and miss. For every Inception and The Prestige, there's Interstellar and TDKR.
Also, The Prestige is a massively awesome movie. Tesla plays a key small role and the film was made fantastically.
Just watched the Prestige again. Wild ass movie.
The prestige amazing movie
Ha! That's the one I haven't seen. Man, Inception was so convoluted. “ @Illegal_Machine: The Prestige is the only Nolan movie I can stomach.”
I can't decide which movie to watch first. The Prestige or Her.
@TheOfficialBale Hellow bro, I just saw the prestige movie, you were incredible, @RealHughJackman also did a marvelous job
I hope Aleksander Back made a good movie, going to spoil myself & go watch the Hitman in the Prestige cinema. Loved that Ps game.

Bonus: in the Christopher Nolan movie The Prestige the main characters' names spell ABRA (as in Abra Cadabra)
The Prestige is a good movie.
The movie The Prestige is confusing yet amazing
You know what? Fuck interstellar, inception and batman shits. The Prestige remains Nolan's best movie till date.
The Prestige gives me a movie boner
I just watched the prestige twice! Back to back. No matter how many time I've seen that movie, it intrigues me every time.

The Prestige is free on YouTube and if you haven't seen it I highly suggest watching it. Great movie
The Illusionist is nowhere near The Prestige. Mental movie by Nolan that. One of Bale & Jackman's best.
Always associate @ThomYorke's Analyse w/ premiere of Chris Nolan's movie of Chris Priest's The Prestige, Leicester Sq (plays under credits).
Every now and then there's a movie that I re-watch to self motivate again. If you haven't seen "The Prestige", I highly recommend.

Which was the last good movie you watched? — the prestige... http://ask.fm/a/bnc2de7j 
Is The Prestige movie any good? I wanna go back watching some of the old I skipped, recommend anything outside 50 Shades of Gray or Twilight
http://i.imgur.com/o0GGPkd.gif  "What movie is that?" "The Prestige"
Really though. The prestige is just a movie about pranks. Prank after prank leading to one movie long prank. Pranks!!
THE PRESTIGE, there's a twisty movie for ya. Blows your stinking mind #TheThirdTwin
The Prestige! Amazing movie! What a movie night with @MaddiiBaj @LukeEndsHere @KaneEndsHere @DaveEndsHere
@AllanSchumacher The only thing I love more than The Prestige is the IMDB message board where everyone misses the point of this movie.
Tonight's movie: The Prestige
@TheRealMattC It's the first movie that absolutely blew me away since The Prestige. Definitely deserves the number one spot.
@bdgrabinski It's fine, but it's super, super safe. The prestige movie-est movie that got a bunch of nominations.
I am SO SHOCKED they gave it to the prestige film instead of the deserving movie about apes. SHOCKED. #Oscars
The Prestige is a great movie. I highly suggest it.
district 9 is the best movie that's ever been made besides the dark knight and inception and the prestige
Tho granted JP kinda created its own genre, the prestige monster movie. JP2 is much more indulgent, straight up comic book monster movie

I will seldom argue more passionately than when someone tries to tell me The Illusionist is a better movie than The Prestige.
Most Christopher Nolan movies are. Rt @Crislex: The Prestige was such a mind fuck movie
What made The Prestige even better is I thought we were going to see Edward Norton magic movie and wasn't excited about it. Then got THAT.

The Prestige is still my favorite movie, but watching on a flight home from England, I realize how bad Scarlett Johansson's accent is in it.
The Prestige also features Gollum and, of all people, David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (hear that, @lizzyf620? Bowie! In a movie!). It's awesome.

If you liked movies like the Prestige and Inception, you'll like Interstellar. What an amazing movie
@MikeCracchiolo Point Break may be the only movie ending I hated more than the Prestige.
this guy's favorite movie is inception, and he likes the prestige. wow, he's awesome.
Aha! According to Wikipedia, Nolan reportedly blocked a movie tie-in edition of The Prestige to keep the ending a secret. #motive

Watched 'the prestige' movie. Every work of Christopher Nolan has made him a legend!why the hell I had missed watching this movie earlier.
Every great magic trick consists of three parts, the pledge ,turn and The PRESTIGE .watched the movie for the sixth time.!
I could never truly appreciate the greatness of the movie "The Prestige" since I never understood it,I watched it today and it is the best.
So Interstellar is a puzzle movie after all. I should have known. Maybe the pocket universe at the end explains the end of The Prestige, too
Just gonna watch every Christopher Nolan movie ever made, starting with the Prestige right now.

The prestige is a greatttt movie
Interstellar was great, but far from Nolan's best movie imo. Miles away from Inception, The Prestige or Memento. Still, damn impressive!
The Prestige is the world's best movie. It's as mind blowing as inception.
Started watching The Prestige in English today and it was a really interesting movie, I want to finish it since class was only 50 minutes
(even so, THE PRESTIGE is still Nolan's best movie, and the argument for his, and its, materialism is valid)
@DJSega oh hell yeah! Have you seen The Prestige? There's some crazy stuff going on in that movie
The prestige' Movie is mad thrill.

@balaneski @olearychris @Dave_CHED okay. "The Prestige" > all. Now there's a conspiracy movie. #ItsABloodyDouble!
The Prestige. That movie is woowww good.
"Inception" and "The Prestige" are about screwing around with storytelling/movie logic. They say nothing about real life.

With that said, Interstellar is still a great movie, just don’t go in expecting it to be even better than Inception or The Prestige ;-)

@jim_napier I maintain The Prestige (for me at least) is his best movie. But I also love Inception and TDK almost as much.
Interstellar's $50M+ weekend is Chris Nolan's worst movie opening since the prestige in 2006. (It would have been his best at that time.)
Nothing really more to add about Interstellar other than it needs to be seen on a huge screen and it's Nolans best movie since The Prestige
As until now,my favourite nolan movie is the prestige.lets see if that will change three hours from now.

Scarlett in the movie The Prestige is just pure gold.
Looking forward to Interstellar but I doubt it will top my personal favorite Nolan (non-Batman) movie, The Prestige.
Every movie Nolan has made since The Prestige has been The Prestige* * not necessarily a bad thing. I loved the Prestige.
The Prestige really is an awesome movie.
THE PRESTIGE is still easily my favorite Christopher Nolan movie, I think because it so owns its chilliness.
After listening to debate today, I'll tell you that you're all wrong. The Prestige is Christopher Nolan's best movie & it isn't even close.
INCEPTION is Chris Nolan's best movie. THE PRESTIGE is my favorite Chris Nolan movie. Hoping INTERSTELLAR falls somewhere in between.

The Prestige was one hell of a movie. I swear, it left me with my mouth hanging open
Just realized that except for The Prestige, I have seen every Christopher Nolan movie since Memento on opening week. Yes, even Insomnia.
If there is one movie I wish I could experience for the first time it's The Prestige. It's my all-time favorite movie.
Kyle Seager over Josh Donaldson for Gold Glove is like saying the Illusionist is a better movie then the Prestige.
@DeevElliott But I may give it a shot. Though I only thoroughly enjoyed one Nolan movie, and that was The Prestige.

It says something that the lowest rated movie directed by Christopher Nolan is The Prestige
According to IMDB, Christopher Nolan's worst movie is The Prestige. Can he do no wrong?
Wait, is it that time when we start ranking Nolan? All I know is THE PRESTIGE is dead last. It's the only movie of his I really don't like.
"The Prestige" was Nolan's lowest ranking film? I would've guessed it was "Insomia" or the 3rd Batman movie.
