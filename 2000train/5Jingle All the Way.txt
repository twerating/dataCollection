Jingle All the Way 2 starring Larry the Cable Guy is an actual thing. Just...why? Like who willingly payed money to get that movie made?
Jingle All the Way is a seriously underrated Christmas movie. #turboman
If Jingle All The Way 2 DOESN'T have Larry the Cable Guy dressing up as Harrison the Talking Bear, I'm not buying the movie.
Carlos is 100% wrong, Jingle All the Way is the best Christmas movie of all time. It has action, romance, and Arnold Schwarzenegger
If you don't think that jingle all the way (besides elf) is the best Christmas movie ever, you're wrong #putthatcookiedown
