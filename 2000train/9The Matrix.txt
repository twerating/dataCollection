THE MATRIX. "Stop trying to hit me and HIT ME!" Great movie; why didn't they ever make any sequels?
Legit might go to bed. But the matrix is on amc. This movie is hilarious. Total B movie disguised as blockbuster.
My gran gran has never seen the matrix, so she thought it was a scary movie, lol
Any intelligent person seeking to disrupt, transform, or merely effect significant change should watch / study this movie: The Matrix.
The Matrix is on, y'all. It's a shame they never made any sequels to this movie.
Idk about you all but no movie series in my opinion touches the matrix in my opinion
For a Sci-fi movie, The Matrix is more realistic than Star Wars...
I feel sad for people who never understood what "The Matrix" movie was all about.... Like that's the beginning of Awareness!

If Neo would have taken the blue pill, The Matrix would've been the exact same movie, except he'd have had a hard on the whole time.

Rewatching THE MATRIX, which I contend is a perfect movie. Amazing world creation, clever plotting, no weak subplots. Masterful. #MovieTime
I remember one time I took acid and watched The matrix. My ass literally thought I was in The Matrix the whole entire movie lol
The movie the Matrix was basically about capitalism Work, get married, have a kid teach him the same cycle How is that living ?
We are living in the Matrix. What a trip. When you wake up it's hard at first to accept it for what it is. It is like the movie the Matrix.
Ok I haven't seen the whole movie but in the matrix when someone dies in the dream world do they die in the real world too???
A lot of people like the movie "The Matrix," but still choose to live it in.. #LetThatSimmer

In The Matrix movie just after they woke him up in the car they were trying to get a bug out of him.

Just rewatched the Matrix with my gf who never watched it before. It's weird to realize how much this movie shaped myself.
Just caught the end of The Matrix on ITV2. Great movie and the main reason I got into Rage Against The Machine. #WakeUp
Re-watching the Matrix. still a great movie & still makes me laugh that my wife originally watched it thinking that the hero was called Neil
I walked out of The Matrix when I saw it. And it was an inflight movie.
The opening scene of the matrix is fantastic, one of, if not the best movie trilogy to date.
