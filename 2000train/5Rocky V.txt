At least the latest Star Wars movie won't be as bad as the last 3. The Prequels made Rocky V look like an Academy Award winner.
Rocky V is a movie I think even Sylvester Stallone wants to forget about. Haven't seen Creed yet, but I've heard it's great.
Another movie that releases in january I want to see: Creed. I loved all of the Rocky movies, except for Rocky V.
I'm pretty much always down to watch a Rocky movie... just warn me beforehand if it's Rocky V.. i'ma still watch it, I just wanna know
Galhiel says Rocky V is the best movie out of the whole series
@RichardWade @DustinNickerson Im a fan of both but Rocky only has 1 bad movie, Rocky V. Star Wars has a whole bad trilogy, I, II, & III.
I feel like the new Star Wars movie will be a Rocky V and we all saw how that went
Rocky V is a bad movie.
Creed is a damn good movie!!! Can't decide what part I loved more- the one-take fight or finding out who won the third Rocky v Apollo fight.
@RobotsPJs There's no excuse needed to watch a Rocky movie. Even Rocky V or Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge.

Speaking of Rocky V, the life of Tommy Morrison (Gunn) would be a fascinating movie. Truly dark tale. http://es.pn/14ePha5 
@Judson1360 @alexpadilla86 The Don King wannabe dude in Rocky V was straight out of B movie land
Rocky V was such a horrible movie compared to the rest
"Rocky V" (1990) is a nasty movie (D) #AhiMovieReviews <nz3jno>
" @TheKidSkoob: It is a very good movie, though. I just hate the hype." The hype is also related to it being much better than Rocky V & VI
@Midday180 I really like John Feinstein but him saying Rocky V is a good movie is wrong, it's the worst Rocky movie
Didn't like how Rocky V ended but liked the movie itself
After a long day, nothing's better than a cup of hot green tea and a good movie. Watching "Rocky V" now.

@erincandy Rocky Balboa is the movie Rocky V should have been.
@trey31968 @GoApePodcast @SavageGM @ApesMovies that Escape movie was trash. It's the Rocky V of POTA. Or as you guys would say, Generations.

@dhm I remember watching Rocky V at the Orleans 8 and people yelling "Yo, there's a SEPTA bus in the movie". Mind blown.
Rocky V is my favorite movie all time

@shomihelps @shomicanada please fix the movie rocky v Says 104 mins running time but length is only 58:14 and stops playing
I'm supposed to watch Rocky V tonight, but I think I feel like a baseball movie.
CREED just usurped THE MARTIAN as my Movie of the Year. We're talking "Mickey's speech in ROCKY V" levels of emotion here.
Well, I think tonight I'll start that 6-movie rewatch in preparation for that huge new movie out there. But Rocky V is going to be a chore.
@reihan Probably. As I said, I am horrible in terms of a movie criticism. We can all of course agree Rocky V was horrible.
Movie #170 Rocky 5.5 Movie #171 Rocky II 5 Movie #172 Rocky III 4 Movie #173 Rocky IV 4.5 Movie #174 Rocky V 2.5 Movie #175 Rocky Balboa 4
Rocky V isn't a bad movie. Its just that the series is so great that it pales in comparison to the first three especially and the fourth.
And yes, we will be watching 3,4, and Rocky Balboa. Then going to see Creed. Screw Rocky V. That movie sucks out loud.
@IanKenyonNFL reviving Rocky worked out well after Rocky V which was the worst ending in movie history.
You know, Rocky might be the most consistently watchable movie series to make it to 7. ROCKY V is the only real stinker, but the others...
#CREED was everything 'Rocky V' should have been! Definitely my new favorite movie of 2015!
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/JjAx5Z8RPmo?a  YOU DON'T HATE THAT MOVIE: ROCKY V
Saw Creed last night. Excellent movie not sure why people are surprised the first one did win best picture, but they did also make rocky V
During the movie, my mom asked how Adrian died. I said she saw Rocky V and killed herself
The street fight at the end of Rocky V may be my favorite scene from a movie ever! #Fb
Rocky V is an awful, awful movie.
Watching Rocky V & I can't help thinking that if they edited out all the scenes w/ his kid it'd actually be a pretty good movie.
Real talk- Creed is the movie that Rocky V wishes it was. Damn good.
Rocky V was the worst movie...it ranks up there w/ Phantom Menace in terms of being pure trash.
I don't want to shit on too many parts of Rocky V and especially what happened to Sage Stallone but seriously, fuck that movie
@mattzollerseitz As I was saying to someone else, Rocky V was the right movie at the wrong time. It needed an older, humbler Stallone.
@mattzollerseitz There's a movie where Rocky fights Mr. T AND Hulk Hogan and Rocky V is still the most embarrassing of the bunch.
Great movie. Totally forget seeing Rocky V, never saw Rocky VI, but glad I saw VII tonight! https://twitter.com/creedmovie/status/670376996397031424 …
Siang ini download Rocky I-IV plus Rocky Balboa ah buat movie marathon weekend ini. Rocky V dilewati saja karena ceritanya nggak penting.

I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/4bIshftlKR4?a  Rocky V Movie CLIP - My Ring's Outside
The last five minutes of ROCKY BALBOA make up for the previous 100. Still not a good movie. Better than Rocky V, but not I-IV.
Creed was a decent movie. The final fight was extremely a rocky v creed type fight
Target had a Rocky 4-movie set for sale for $8. So, I guess Rocky V is no longer in continuity?

Gotta make sure I watch Rocky V before Creed because I don't wanna be lost during the movie.
Rocky V is the Rocky movie for people who hate Rocky movies. It's the Yeezus of Rocky movies.
Rocky V really gets a bad rap. Because it's a terrible movie, is why.
So, Rocky V isn’t a good movie. However it’s certainly not a terrible one. Further, at least it tried to break formula and take a risk.
@BillyCorben you're wrong Billy Rocky V, while being the weakest in the franchise is still a great movie. Many great scenes. @laquinton
Following up TURKISH STAR WARS with ROCKY V because sometimes I make questionable movie-watching decisions.
If have to wait until I watch Rocky V tonight to say this for certain but I think Rocky IV mighty be my least favorite Rocky movie?
If you are thinking about making fun of any Rocky movie other than Rocky V, just don't.
@MarceloJPico always thought Rocky V was more of a movie than IV but IV has to be way more essential now and Creed just makes V irrelevant.
Rocky IV is a great movie. Rocky V on the other hand... #SorryImNotCleverEnoughToComeUpWithAJoke #LongHashtags Happy Thanksgiving to all.
@paulscheer Not for the boxing movie franchise, but Rocky V has been accepted as a missing book of the Bible.

@Cassidy2099 and shot like a horror movie by the end. I've always seen Rocky V as being ahead of its time.
Don't know how they did it, but they've finally made a movie better than Rocky V. #CreedMovie
@JosephTimmer yes, I will. If I could give Rocky Balboa a chance after Rocky V, I can pretty much watch any future Rocky movie.

Rocky V is basically the same plot as The Super Dave Movie, a movie I have seen and enjoyed. #ReRock
An hour into the movie is way too late into Rocky V to callback to the opening shot of Rocky. #ReRock

MOVIE FACT: 'Rocky V' was the first film ever made about a boxer who didn't have anyone to fight against.
@JMSmithey Rocky V doesn't even deserve to be ranked. Just an awful movie.
Watched another great movie Rocky V. Only Rocky Balboa can make street fight look cool. #sylvesterstallone #rockybalboa

Just saw the trailer for #Southpaw which looks like Rocky III and Rocky V rolled into one movie
I think in the movie Creed were finally gonna get to see what happened in the Rocky v Apollo fight behind closed doors can't wait
Watch every Rocky movie EXCEPT for Rocky V..That one was awful.
@SchmoesJTE Rocky V. Genuinely don't understand the level of hate the movie gets.
Thank God for Rocky Balboa. That movie erased the horrible taste that was Rocky V. Only good thing about that movie was the street fight.
rocky v is a chill ass movie rn
Tbh Rocky V was the most lit movie I've ever seen
I think if @spike would have skipped #Rocky V in their movie marathon that no one would have even noticed. It's all about Rocky I-IV.
Rocky V is on. This movie is shit.
Rocky V is such a bad movie that it is disappointing.
Watching Rocky V. This is a better movie than I remember.
**family is watching Rocky V** Three year-old niece: "I don't like this movie." My brother: "No one does."
I may or may not have watched every trailer to the #Rocky movie series in reverse order (starting with Rocky V).
If you ever need motivation just watch any Rocky movie except Rocky V
"CREED" is going to be a very good movie, it might make up for the mistake that was "Rocky V"
@DrGhett0Batman rocky v was a rocky movie... Lol
@jerrydoyle @TheSlyStallone I've seen this movie before. It was called Rocky V.
@PhillyNews360 Haha! No disrespect at all. In fact, I have every movie on DVD...even Rocky V! #TommyGunn
@JCBaggee I'm in the minority, but I think Rocky V gets a bad rap. There's some stuff I really like in that movie.
. @Deadspin Why would you want to forget about Rocky Balboa? That movie was 20x better than Rocky V. Gave us an epic quote also.
Creed movie trailer looks good. Rocky V & Balboa didn't exactly set the bar too high though.
I'm so glad they decided to make another Rocky movie Rocky V and Rocky Balboa did not do the Rocky saga justice.
All jokes aside, is Rocky V Stallone's worst movie?
As long as the Movie about Apollos Creeds son is better than Rocky V I'll be happy
@norespect8487 new Rocky movie...at least we won't have to watch Stallone again lol gotta be better than Rocky V right ?
@Deadspin why would they need to "forget it"? Rocky Balboa wasn't a bad movie, Rocky V on the other hand.....
@Deadspin What!?! Agree with others. 'Rocky Balboa' was a good movie. Made everyone forget about 'Rocky V,' which never happened!!
@Deadspin Balboa?? That movie was an AFI top 100 compared to #Rocky V
New #Creed movie looks interesting. Can I just put it out there that I'm the one who likes and owns Rocky V... Feel free to unfollow.
I've watched Rocky V so many times and that movie sucks. #iainthearnobell #myringsoutside
@KellenDaniel @WrestlingInc That's an insult to Groundhog Day. If Raw was a movie it'd be Rocky V so everyone could forget it even happened.
For worst 90s movie u could have said Phantom Menace or Rocky V(both franchise killers) #MovieFights #GetRileyonMovieFights @andysignore

Anyone with the Encore movie channels, they're showing Rocky through (why?) Rocky V staggered on 2 channels. IV and II on right now.
Seeing #JurassicWorld today. I hope this makes up for the third movie (kinda what Rocky Balboa did to Rocky V)
@RealMichaelKay except for rocky V. We've collectively agreed that movie never happened
"Rocky V" (1990) is a poorly written movie (D) #DallasCritic <npnalw>
Rocky V is a good movie

Sepp Blatter's favorite Sylvester Stallone movie is Rocky V. #FIFA
What the heck are these book awards? I don't like books! I mean, the movie adaptation of Rocky V was better than the book! Am I right?

@TheSlyStallone why don't you like Rocky V? I thought it was a great movie
I've never seen someone in so much pain from the terribleness of a movie, as Brad currently is while watching Rocky V.
Rocky V is by far the best movie ever
Rocky V is my favorite movie in the Rocky franchise
When Rocky beats the hell out of Tommy Gunn in Rocky V... Talk about a great movie
Rocky V is that movie rs
I gotta say Rocky V really is an awful movie. This coming from a die hard Rocky fan.
SMH at DirecTv. High ass monthly bill and you have the audacity to still be showing Rocky V?? Great movie, when I saw it way back in 1990.
@CAntista @stevenEchambers Can't sign off on Rocky V. That movie is brutal.
Rocky V is the worst movie of all time and I say that with a lot of pride

@joeljarnagin134 I can honestly say I have seen each rocky movie at least 10 times. Except Rocky V. That one was just awful
i will have you know that i am an expert on boxing, sir. i've seen *every* Rocky movie multiple times. Yes, even Rocky V.
After tonight’s fight, I found Rocky V on a pay channel…wow, I almost forgot just how awful this movie is…dreadful
I'd honestly rather watch Rocky V and that movie sucks.
"This is Spinal Tap" is a hilarious movie. Far better than real boxing... (Save Rocky V)

I chose "Rocky V" because I feel like that's the movie where Stallone started to become a weird puffy faced Gargamel looking oddball.
Rocky V is a good movie and if you disagree with me, I'll kick your ass in a Philadelpia street fight like Rocky Balboa did to Tommy Gunn.
Just watched Rocky V for the 100000th time...still the best boxing movie ever...and by that i dont mean Rocky V i mean all Rocky's.

I had a Rocky movie marathon this week, and watched all six movies. Though, I skipped through parts of Rocky V to get through it.

Why did they ever make Rocky V? That movie was terrible. Rocky Balboa (pt.6) ain't even worth mentioning. Should've stopped at part IV.
Rocky V new fav movie..
Rocky I, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V and Rocky Balboa! is awsome movie!

Can wait my fav movie Rocky V
@OWHBottomLine Look, outside of No. 1, none of these is a great movie. Rocky V has a 1990s trainwreck quality that speaks to me.
Rocky VI was the best movie in the franchise since Rocky II or III. Rocky V was by far the worst and IV was hysterical @MikeandMike
Rocky V is on...literally just missed the only good part of the movie "You knocked him down, why don't you try knocking me down now."
No person in a movie will ever get me as mad as Tommy Gunn did in Rocky V
Ahh the American cinematic masterpiece that is Rocky V. Why does this movie have such a bad rep? #underrated

Spending Valentines Day watching Rocky V, the greatest movie of all time is what every true American should do.
Rocky V--3/5. Hard one to rate. It's probably a pretty terrible movie by itself, but a lot of the themes work within the series as a whole.
Rocky V shouldn't count as a movie

In a few days, Rocky V will have been a bad movie for 25 years.

@oneredcatmedia @WillDangerZone I actually like Rocky V as a standalone movie. Just wasn't fitting as the fifth instalment and/or conclusion
What I meant to write was that Tommy was a weak opponent. I do think that Rocky V was a movie that held up well. It is quite decent.
@DanRyckert And Rocky V really is everything that every movie shouldn't be.
Confirmed: Round 2 of the Rocky v. Drago fight in Rocky IV is my favorite sports movie moment. Pure adrenaline coursing through my veins.
Dad gave me a run down of which Rocky movie we should play the Rocky theme from Friday. He decided Rocky V.
@rmj_equals_hero he was really bad in Rocky V. I'm not saying that I'm glad he died, but he was really, really bad in that movie.

Rocky |V and Scary movie 4 have me in a great mood
@tealuke I realize I broke the format for Rocky 5 instead of Rocky V, but really that movie should've been called ENTER THE MACHINE

I’m sorry, Rocky V is a terrible movie. It’s the only one in the series I don’t like. Watching it in the background…
ROCKY V really means well, and even has some strong moments, but the movie has no idea what story it's trying to tell.
Rocky V, great movie.
"Rocky V" is a much better movie than "Rocky IV", even in spite of its crippling lack of Apollo Creed.
@Sam_Strange My Rocky V questions: Do you think Sage Stallone's death retroactively makes V a better movie?
Rocky V is a great full circle movie.
One of the best fight scenes in movie history Rocky vs Tommy Gunn at the end of Rocky V. Whats your pick..

Rocky V isn't a bad movie really
I was trying to watch Rocky IV and almost made the terrible mistake of putting on that abortion of a movie Rocky V
All the Rocky sequels are pretty amazing. We just don't talk about Rocky V. It's the black sheep of the movie
I'm not sure yet if Rocky V is any good but it's definitely interesting. I think I love this movie, flaws and all.
Hunter Pence thinks no movie is better than Rocky V #HunterPenceSigns
Can't decide which movie to watch, Rocky I, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V or Rocky VI #rockyproblems
What is this reference to a Rocky V? No such movie exists. Rocky I, II, III, IV and Rocky Balboa. That’s it.
After the Salmond Vs Darling debate, people are now re-evaluating Rocky V as a 'probably not that bad a movie after all'.
Hunter Pence thought Rocky V was the best movie in the series
@Septicor It's actually Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6). Very good movie that redeemed itself from bad Rocky V. Now how that ties into X-Box one, IDK
Just watched Rocky V. Why DO people hate this movie? I thought it was pretty good. It had a little of heart.
Time for my Saturday Night Movie! Tonight's feature - Rocky V! #yoadrian #frozenyogurt #moviegeek
@cliffwilliams @prak_daddy - Yes. I am such a Cos fan that the movie depressed me. Like many Rocky fans with Rocky V. They don't count it.
@BabyBaker2x #epic (side note...Worst Movie of All Time? Rocky V)
The stupidest part of the Rocky series is the robot from Rocky IV. Not Rocky V, not the fake retirements, not the last movie. The robot.
Other than Rocky V, Rocky III is definitely the worst movie in the franchise. #RockyIII
Nice, Rocky V, or the worst Rocky, is on! Even my late, almost great, distant cousin couldn't help this movie! RIP Tommy Morrison
Rocky V is by far the best Rocky movie
Trying to watch rocky V. So far there's a red head who's trying to be hot but isn't,wannabe don king, & poo on every movie prior @AlexDonno
@Metsochist4Life @JMincone Rocky V is so craptastic it could be the best movie ever
@andrewtwalk thanks for sharing this...Drago has these guys in Rocky IV & there's no Rocky V or Rocky Balboa movie. #24yearslate
Movie Fact: The original script of Rocky V had Rocky dying at the end of the street fight with Tommy Gunn. But let's just forget that movie
Watching the movie; Rocky V *-*

#Rocky V.S. #Dodgeball, Field of Dreams V.S. A League of their Own. What would you say is the greatest #sports #movie of all time?
Speaking of Rocky V, they should've kept the Director's Cut of it. It's way better than the actual movie. It's actually good!
Honestly, if a Rocky movie is on TV, how do I not watch it? With Rocky V being the obvious exception.
Rocky V. Outside of Indy IV the biggest blaspheme committed against a great movie franchise. AFI should have been given arresting powers.
Rocky V was the worst Rocky movie, ever. Creed could possibly take that title. #Rocky
@DanRyckert aside from Rocky V, its still the worst Rocky movie by far. Works better if you consider it a musical!
Rocky V was the worst rocky movie
Rocky V has always been my favorite rocky movie!
Watching rocky v because it's the best rocky movie ever.

Rocky V is my favorite movie out of all 6 films
It would nice if AMC showed the Rocky Balboa 2006 movie in the #RockyFest & pretend like Rocky V never existed lol
That was fun #RockyFest but not watching Rocky V. That movie should've never been made & honestly a insult to the original 4
Watching my fav. Movie "Rocky IV" and Rocky V coming up next
Rocky v is on at 12:30 so maybe I'll actually go out tonight after all. Fuck that movie. Worst sequel ever made.
@MikeGiardi You're confusing Rocky IV with a bad movie... like Rocky V. #IfHeDiesHeDies
When a 5yr old girl has her choice of any movie... Frozen, Lorax, Grinch, Little Mermaid. NOPE-chose Rocky V. I luv it. #Mylittlecompetitor
“ @pwilliamsNHL: Heart's on fire, indeed, Mr. Balboa.” Rocky IV - my favourite movie...remember seeing it in the theatre. Rocky V - terrible.
Corey and Justin's favorite Rocky movie is Rocky V #VoteRizzo MT @CoreyAldritt Don't listen kids. VoteMorneau

Potential spinoff movie: vaguely dramatic undercard before Rocky v Ivan Drago @richinferno
OK Twitter. I challenge you! Worst movie: Fast and Furious 2, Superman III, Rocky V or Star Trek (the re-boot)???
@TayandJShow As well as any Rocky movie, I-IV. Rocky I is the only truly "great" film, but they're all great. Rocky V, however, I ignore.
Rocky V is easily the most inspirational movie ever
@mikeyceej actually the movie is called "Rocky Balboa" rocky v was made in the early 90's
In the context of their respective series, which movie was worse: Rocky V or Beverly Hills Cop 3?
There is a Rocky movie for every mood. Tonight, "Rocky V: Go For It"
@Themikeaviles Worse movie sequel: House Party 2, Rocky V or Beverly Hills Cop 3?
"Rocky V" (1990) is a shameful movie (D) #ConamaraViews <n6qx2b>

Rocky V is my favorite Rocky movie
Rocky V sucks, but it's still a rocky movie so fuck it
@BigDaddyBax Any Rocky movie besides Rocky V > Rocky V
Rocky IV is the perfect terrible 80s movie. Rocky V is just terrible.
@ColemanESPN hey now, Rocky Balboa wasn't that bad, better than Rocky V and probably Stallone's last decent movie
@MarkEMark33 @OrbaniDiana Rocky V is a classic movie. "Hey Tommy, I didn't hear no bell".
Rocky V really is the worst one, but Rocky II is the most boring. Rocky II is only considered a better movie because it has the tiger jacket
The acting, the music, the message in Rocky V is all just fucking perfected within a movie
@mikemariionn@ dtmleach rocky V is a terrible movie. Go #tigers
Rocky V is the ultimate 80's 'Murica movie.
God Rocky V is so stupid. WORST. MOVIE. EVER.
Never knew Rocky V was a descent movie.
@erscimia I wish someday someone will make a movie about what Aunt Robot was doing during Rocky V & VI.
Rocky V might be my least favorite movie. Rocky Balboa might be my favorite movie.
I love rocky v the movie

Anyone who says Rocky V is a valid Rocky movie needs to revaluate their lives
@trashymctrash We should have a Rocky marathon minus Rocky V (awful movie).
@leesargent I always catch that fight when I tune into a station to watch a better movie that is following Rocky V.
The tagline for this should have been "Rocky V: The most unnecessary movie ever made!" #RockyV
If Adrian died between Rocky V and VI, would that make VII: Adrian's Revenge a zombie movie? I would pay to see Rocky take on the zombies
Rocky V isn't a bad movie...in fact, more than anything, I admire the performance of Richard Gant as the villain in it.
If Rocky V could end when Rock is remembering Mick in the gym and he gives him the cuff link it would improve the movie greatly.

Speaking of Ohio sports, that Draft Day movie is going to be the biggest flop since Rocky V
Someone really needs to photoshop the Rocky V movie poster replacing Stallone with Valencia (from tonight) and call it Tony V - just saying
We're recording our #ROCKY V podcast today. Is this movie underrated? #stallone
Rocky V is a great movie.
Rocky V has to be the dumbest movie I have ever seen. Not the worst, but pretty fucking dumb.
So I completely forgot that Rocky V just simply descends into a street fight in the end. What a crappy movie.
The only reason Rocky V isn't usually put in a good light is cause the other movies it had to live up to, it isn't a bad movie at all
Rocky V has got to be the worst Rocky movie.
My favorite Rocky movie is on that is Rocky V
I never watch boxing anymore because it can never match the excitement of a Rocky movie. Nor even Rocky V.
//sob I hate Rocky V this movie is not making life okay //cries
Rocky V is such an emotional movie and it hURTS MY SOUL ROCKY BBY NOOOOOOOOO Q A Q
I worked so long today that the ending of “Rocky V” somehow gave me goosebumps. I'm so tired that even that terrible movie moved me.
@chadinportland Watching little E from Entourage in Rocky V get his ass kicked is the best part of that movie.
Rocky V is the worst movie of the series
Watching rocky V , love this movie
Rocky V will always be my favorite movie
Watching Rocky V. "Having my son was like being born again." Best quote in the entire movie. " ok that & "Thank u for being born" at the end

Watching Rocky V because this movie is awesome
Watching Rocky V......Movie was damn near garbage......Snow day shit

@chaddukes best bad movie: Rocky V never should have been made. But I can't look away.
O no dan nada en la tele o dan Scary Movie 2, LQSA, Rocky IV y Rocky V, puta bida
It's hard not to get motivated watching a rocky movie... Except rocky v that's will just piss you off
I wish rocky V would have been about rocky and drago's parallel broken lives after this fight, and not a movie people intentionally forgot
I'll never forget my wrestling coach giving me the rocky V movie and him saying he gave it to me for a reason.
Rocky V is on! About time the put a good movie on. #RockyThon
@ChromeBabyMomma I'm watching Rocky V ....I almost forgot how Sly talked in the movie....haha!
Rocky V is in TV? I thought we all agreed to pretend that movie never happened...
Rocky V was trash but that final fight was some good ass shit but it get swept under the rug cuz how bad the movie was
I don't care what anyone says. Rocky V is a damn good movie.
"Look, an old-fashioned movie!" says Kerry as we turn on the TV to Rocky V
Watching Rocky V....Its amazing how terrible of an actor Sylvestor Stallone was in that movie. You can barely understand him...
I don't even consider Rocky V apart of that movie franchise
Rocky V is my least favorite Rocky movie...haven't seen it in at least 10 years....it's not as bad as I remember
I think I'm the only one who thinks Rocky V is a decent movie, except for the writing and acting.
in Rocky V, a band welcomes him home with the Rocky theme? Does that exist in the movie? Do all boxers get their own orchestral arrangement
The fact that they recap Rocky IV in the beginning of Rocky V doesn't do the movie any favors. "Here's our best one! Now enjoy this shit..."
Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V all back to back !!!!! God is so good to me—my favorite movie trilogy .
@TheRcok_ hey rocky v expecting more for ur upcoming movie the herculous .. Hope goona blast .. Wen will b opening worldwide .. Awaiting !!
@truebluela ML II was about as godawful a movie they ever made. I pretend it never happened (a la Rocky V) so I never saw part 3

Being forced to watch Rocky V. Have I said here how much I hate that movie? It's soooooo bad!
@m_SAPienza 1) Rocky V is as much a movie as a Vine 2) Rocky IV is not a good movie 3) Rocky I is the best of the series
@m_SAPienza is trying to convince me that Rocky VI is the best movie and that Rocky V is good #getthefuckoutofhere
Hmmmm to watch Klitschko movie or Rocky V
Nobody warned me Rocky V wasn't a sports movie. Man that was rough.

Rocky V is an awful movie.
So I re-watched every #Rocky movie the past week,And 1 thing that is obvious is that Rocky V should've never been made, Such a horrid movie
The best Rocky movie is 4, the worst is Rocky V. But in between is all a mess.
@SeanCablinasian @heydannyv By Rocky V, you mean Rocky Balboa right? The alleged movie with Tommy Morrison never happened. Never.
So is this movie 'Grudge Match' like some Rocky v. Jake Lamotta from Raging Bull type shit or nahhhh?
Insomniac cinema: Rocky V. Never seen it before. Bad movie but Stallone's performance is legit.
The street fight at the end of Rocky V is one of the best movie fights EVER...
@coughlin007 Joffrey's favorite movie is Rocky V.
That "Grudge Match" movie looks like Rocky V meets Grumpy Old Men. #Stallone
Are they really doing a Rocky v. Raging Bull movie? Oh... I thought the poster at Regal Union Square was a joke. Sigh...
Why is the Movie Boxing Commission letting Stallone fight 23 years after Rocky V? Disappointing.
So disappointed in Stallone and DeNiro. This movie "Grudge Match" looks like more of a joke than Rocky V
Am I the only one looking forward to the Rocky v Raging Bull movie?
Sly Stallone's first movie was a soft core porn called The Party at Kitty and Stud's in 1970. I bet it was still better than Rocky V

Rocky V is such an underrated movie. Rest in Peace Tommy Gunn.
Fans lose Tommy Morrison, the star that made "Rocky V" the sixth best Rocky movie ever made.
Saw Rocky V trending and was gonna tweet how the movie sucked, but it turns out Tommy died oh
RIP Tommy Gunn from Rocky V, a movie I happen to like for no explainable reason. "Hey Tommy! I didn't hear no bell!"
I forget that Rocky V also had Sage Stallone who died last year. What a sad movie that was...underrated for unintentional comedy tho.
@DrMievil @blitz_butler I just can't acknowledge Rocky V as a movie therefore its hard to appreciate Tommy Gunn's cinematic accomplishments
R.I.P. Tommy "Machine Gunn" Morrison of Rocky V ...only 44yrs old and lost to HIV ..Not a great movie, but dude had a left hook!
Well that's what you get for making such a shitty movie like Rocky V.

Never seen that pile dogshit known as Rocky V till tonight. Wow. Wow. What a ridiculous movie.
Rocky V is a great movie. I don't care what you think of me.
Watching Rocky V. Sad movie. I hate people that don't appreciate what they learn and get from others. Ego.
Rocky V is on! Such a great movie!
Somehow felt that Rocky IV was the highest grossing Rocky movie. Rocky V the lowest. http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=rocky.htm …
@jambrones I can't figure out which one is the best. Even the end credits for Rocky V were better than the movie #measureofamaaaaan
@ddcoletti Rocky IV's favorite movie is Rocky V. See? I'm not the worst anymore! By a LOT. I'd pick Anchorman. It's the pleats.

I think if Rocky Balboa didn't smoke so many damn cigarettes in the 1st movie, he wouldn't have made the many mistakes that led to Rocky V
Rocky V good movie, motivates me this film!!
Todays beeen longg; helped a bro move house, had a fat kfc & ribs, watched rocky V & now chilling watching the simpsons movie!

“ @LionheartUK: Rocky V... #Believe” I rate that movie HIGHLY!!!
Rocky V you can't be a rocky movie!!
Yessss Rocky V is on tomorrow afternoon! Not the best Rocky movie but still good.
Just heard they're making a new #Rocky movie. Ironically, my son and I have been watching the series the last couple weeks. On Rocky V now.
@waggs_24 I just don't want another movie like Rocky V. Just don't taint the franchise. Sly needs to be included in writing script.
I read they are making another #Rocky #movie... #workingtitle "If You Thought Rocky V was bad..."
Didn't we already get a Rocky movie where he is the mentor? Yeah, it was called ROCKY V and it sucked.
Yes! Sounds like Rocky V. No! “ @TheAVClub:There's going to be another Rocky movie about the grandson of Apollo Creed http://avc.lu/13b2GsE ”
A seventh "Rocky" movie? The Simpsons already did that... "Rocky II plus Rocky V is...Rocky VII, Adrian's Revenge!"
@bdgrabinski Right? That was exactly the movie Rocky V should have been.
rocky v is an awesome movie!!!!! i love it
As much as it pains me to do, Rocky V is up next in the 1st annual @USMMA_Hoops "6 days of Rocky" twitter blitz. A movie easily forgotten.

Watching Rocky V , good ass movie !
HBO Signature about to air "Rocky V". That movie sucked. My then-boyfriend and I walked out on it. We sneaked into "Godfather 3" instead.
Most intimidating line in a movie is in Rocky V when Rocky says to Tommy Gun "you knocked him down, why don't you try knocking me down now"

Yup that might be the worst movie I've ever seen. That was Rocky V bad.
1 of my favorite parts ab the Rocky movies is the credits of Rocky V how they do flashbacks of every Rocky movie. #AmazingSeries
Rocky V is a great movie
Rocky V is my favorite rocky movie
Rocky V love this movie #classic
The last 15 minutes of Rocky V is on HBO Zone right now .. or as I call it the best part of the movie #boxing

Rocky V is the most outrageous movie ever
Sylvester Stallone sounds extremely stupid in Rocky V. His accent gets worse and worse each movie.
Rocky V was not a good movie at all. #TommyGun #LazyMonday #PhilliesOffDay
Rocky v is just an amazing movie
The best part about Rocky V is that Tommy Gunn turned out to be the BUM in real life that he was in the movie.
Drop Dead Fred, Rocky V, and Gigli have nothing on this movie #SMTA
Love the fact that Stallone gave Rocky V 0/10. It's his own movie! Have some faith Sly

Make no mistake, Rocky V is not a good movie. But for some reason I can't hate it too much. No, I don't know either.
@Tylea002 Rocky V is a movie that feels like it was made because Stallone had some time to fill, and wanted to do something.

Rocky V (pt 5) might've been the WORST overall rocky movie, but best believe it had the BEST fight out all of'em
Ok maybe Rocky Balboa isn't the worst movie ever. It picks up eventually. Damn sure better than Rocky V!!!
Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI) is... How can I put this... Should have never been made. It makes Rocky V look like the greatest movie ever made...
" @macpowell: Ok. Worst movie you've ever seen- GO!" Trilogy of Terror. Easily worst movie ever made. Phantom Menace & Rocky V r n bottom 10

Again, I love this movie but this fight is absurd, and Russians rooting for Rocky is more nonsense than Rocky V (if it existed)

@tim_lafleur busting out Rocky V for an illustration should get you bonus points. That's the forgotten Rocky Movie. Haha.
Just finished Rocky V, cheese factor totally eliminated this movie was sick. Alot like the original.
Rocky v. Drago. One of those most incredible fight sequences in a movie that I can think of.

Rocky balboa - great movie. Still not as good at IV but great way to end rather than the pants rocky V.
No man shall ever allow anyone to speak ill of The Simpsons or any Rocky movie. (Exception: Rocky V)
Rocky V is the funniest movie about a retard not called Forrest Gump.
Rocky V has more substance than Rocky III. The beach scene in III makes up for the entire movie.
Rocky Balboa ! What a series of movies ! Rocky V the only movie left to watch in the series !
Rocky V DOESN'T count as an actual movie.
Watching Rocky |V!! Good movie no doubt about it! Hah
Watched "Rocky IV". Not sure why...it really sux. About 70% of the movie is flashbacks/montage. On to "Rocky V". #gluttonforpunishment
i'm not where i wanna be because of him or her or anybody else! Because thats what cowards do and that's not you!" Best movie quote Rocky V
This is like watching two people argue over whether Rocky V or Rocky VI is the best Rocky movie.
Watching Rocky !V and realizing there are so many awesome ways the debate could tie in scenes from this movie
Movie jumping between commercials. Watching Footloose(the original), Jurassic Park III & Rocky V. #Multitasker #FTW

In the argument of which Rocky movie is the best, I think its safe to say everyone pretends Rocky V didn't happen. My pick is IV! #RockyIV
@maddow slight error in the Rocky piece. Rocky V is the worst Rocky movie. @sportsguy33 has written extensively on this.
"Rocky V", my least favorite Rocky movie. "Go for it!".

Rocky V comes off like a made for TV Rocky movie
Facebook seems to have converted me writing "All of them except Rocky V" under "favourite movies" to Rocky V being the only movie I "like".
Admire what Diana Nyad is attempting but it's a bad sequel to a good movie. Rocky was great. Rocky V not so much. We're on Nyad VI by now.

Rocky V shits on any other boxing movie

Rocky V was the worst Rocky movie to ever exist
Rocky V is the worst rocky movie ever thank god they did the last one lol

A few too many blows to the head before Rocky V. RT @UberFacts: Sylvester Stallone helped write every Rocky movie.
can only take so much 'Tommy Gunn" ..there will be only one Tommy Gunn.. Balboa's protege in ROCKY V.. even though the movie was weak

son of Sylvester Stallone, Sage Stallone passes away. I remember seeing him in Rocky V. he was awesome in that movie.

Sad news about Sage Stallone-on screen relationship with Sly in Rocky V-best thing about that movie. Prayers 4my fave actor @TheSlyStallone
News: Sylvester Stallone's son SAGE STALLONE, 36, found dead. Sage appeared with his Dad on the movie Rocky V and Daylight.
Man never knew Sage Stallone played Rocky's son in Rocky V. I loved that not so good movie. #RIP
-BREAKING NEWS: SAGE STALLONE (Syl.Stallone´s son) HAS DIED AT 36 !!!. BEST KNOWN AS BEING THE SON OF "ROCKY BALBOA" IN MOVIE "ROCKY V" !!!.
My heart goes out to the Stallone family. The only movie I know of Sage being in was "Rocky V"
Rest in Peace Sage Stallone. Your acting in Rocky V made the movie better then it actually was.
So many great quotables from Rocky V: "Hey kid, don't change the station," or "My ring is outside". Really fun movie. #Sad
Prayers go out to Sylvester Stallone his son passed away today he was in Rocky V pretty cool he was in a movie with his dad
The late Sage Stallone appeared in a number of films, including "Rocky V" as Rocky Balboa Jr. and in the 1996 disaster movie "Daylight".
so sad to hear about Sage Stallone, first Rocky movie I saw was the one he was in Rocky V, it was also my favorite. RIP Sage.
RIP Sylvester Stallone's son, Sage Stallone, I will always remember when he played in Rocky V movie. My thoughts are for you Sly! <3
Sylvester Stallone's Son Sage Found Dead--I remember him from the movie, Rocky V. My prayers go out to his family.
I have not, and will NEVER SEE the movie Rocky V- As far as I am concerned, it was never made- The series ended in Russia when he beat Drago
Sylvester Stallone's son is dead? I remember him in the dumb movie Rocky V
I'm assuming that Sage Stallone was the kid with Sylvester Stallone in the 1990's Rocky V movie. Sadly, he passed away. #RIP
You can never go wrong with a Rocky movie. Unless its rocky v
Tommy Gun was a real boxer doe , Rocky V was just a movie he was in !!!
Firing up THE worst Rocky movie of them all, Rocky V, but it's got my main man in it so I gotta recognize.

I feel like the last spider man movie is being treated like Rocky V.
Imagine that Over the Top is the transition movie between #RockyIV and Rocky V . . . it's easy if you try . . .
Happy 4th everyone. Don't forget to watch your obligatory 'Rocky' movie marathon today. Feel free to skip over 'Rocky V' though.

@YoungFreeAL Rocky IV #Merica OR any movie except Rocky V. #toosad
The Rocky V soundtrack has to be one of the worst movie soundtracks of all time, with the exception of Elton John's 'Measure of a Man'.
What I learned from Rocky V: If Talia Shire plays the strongest character in your movie, you've got problems, see The Godfather: Part III
When the ghost of Mickey appears in Rocky V, it is the most nonsensical moment in movie history. And I still get chills. #Sawitopeningday90
Rocky V is the best rocky movie. Tommy Gunn who? #streetfight
enjoyed a nice movie day today, but gutted I missed the Rocky V street brawl that was on last night.
#Undecided about what movie to watch...Godfather III or Rocky V.
Rocky V is emotionally a very sound movie, but except that everything was disappointing. It wasn't half as good as the rest. #RIPMickie

Now watching my all time inspirational movie.. Rocky V.

As Netflix CMO, I will request we remove "Rocky V" from the catalog, because that movie never actually happened. #AmeerforNetflixCMO
Rocky V is the best movie ever - Nobody
watching rocky V. Classic they shoot the movie in my old hood
#nw rocky V #classic the best part of the movie is the fight at the end
Live tweeting Rocky V makes the movie more fun. Even If no one gets it. Unless they've seen it.
REEL is showing something called "Rocky V." Yeah, like that's a real movie.
Rocky V is a great movie. I just wish I can understand half of what Stallone is saying.
LOL WTF at this Altitude poll of "favorite ROCKY movie" and 13% voting for ROCKY V...WHAT THE FUCKING HELL THAT MOVIE IS HORRIBLE.
Rocky V was the most successful of the Rocky movie franchise #FactsWithoutWikipedia
I uploaded a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/a-oi1mmOhM0?a  Rocky V 1990 Movie Review
I just got done watching Rocky V. I love this movie.
Planning a series on movie rivals, got a list of the usual suspects (Batman v Joker, Rocky v Apollo etc) Any other more unusual suggestions?
@Bentleysbird and it's like anything else, e.g. I think 'Rocky V' was such a bad movie but that doesn't mean I don't love the franchise!
@Brendan42 Start a fight about it. Saying that movie is good at all is like The Chone saying Rocky V is his favorite. It's stupid!
Wow! Rocky V was really as bad of a movie people said it was. :o
@japarsons That was Rocky IV. Also a bad movie, but Rocky V is when he became broke and pathetic.
So many to choose from: Rocky V! Speed 2. Batman & Robin. RT @japarsons: What was the worst movie sequel of all time? Ready, set, GO!
man rocky V has to be the worst movie ever #flop
Watching Rocky V. Epic movie!!!
Rocky V is the best damn movie #Stallone
Rocky V is a dumb movie
The Matrix is such a good movie. I like the philosophy even more than the fight scenes. The 3rd Matrix was never made, like Rocky V.
"How are you here?" "I just am." LOL -- it's like this movie was written by the brain-damaged Rocky from Rocky V. #Expendables

Rocky V, maybe the saddest movie in the saga :(
@bakeanddestroy Just make sure you skip Rocky V. All that movie'll do is make things worse. Hope ya feel better soon.
@amkelly4 rocky v > every other movie ever made
@Christina_J1210 @vfettke It's a great movie. I'll watch any Rocky movie on TV any time they are on. Except Rocky V.

My top 2 movie quotes .. 1. You knocked him down, why don't you try knocking me down (Rocky V) 2. Rubbin' is racing Harry (Days of Thunder)
I love the Rocky series but Rocky V is a terrible movie. Tommy Gunz and the Don King look who kept saying "Only in America" was trash.
rocky V is a lowkey sad movie man,

How can they put "Rocky V" on #AMC it's American Movie CLASSIC! #irony
I almost did a full 12 hour movie marathon. But thanks to AMC and its many commercials, Rocky V ends at 12:30 and I'm too tired to stay up.
Stallone's performance in Xmas Eve scene at Rocky's house in 'Rocky V' is maybe most embarrassing thing I've ever seen in a movie. I LOVE IT
Rocky V great movie
Watching @KevConzzz as Chickie getting KO'd by Rocky Jr in Rocky V on AMC now. You get any actual boxing training while shooting the movie?

rocky V is the worst fuckin movie
Watching Rocky V dis my movie
rocky v is a sad ass movie
hyperbole aside, I honestly think rocky V is the worst movie I've ever seen.
One of Rocky V's subplots is that Rocky has brain damage. I think Stallone had brain damage when he cast this movie.
Rocky V is on right now. This movie should be banned everywhere.
That movie never happened. RT @RyanGabs: Rocky V is still playing on cable.
I don't care how many times I have seen it, but when #AMC plays any Rocky movie I have to watch... Okay, maybe not Rocky V.

watching last bit of Rocky V. i will watch any Rocky movie, doesn't matter how good or bad, what time of day.
Do you think Stallone calls AMC every time they show Rocky V? Saying that's not the true 5th movie. "Rocky Balboa" is.
Whoever said Rocky V is a bad movie dont know there pecker from a manhole cover #hoosie
Switching back from Rocky IV to Rocky V. If I time this out right, I can watch a whole movie of epic montages.
What is this Rocky V movie on AMC right now? We all know they ended at Rocky IV
@ravensdale Is Rocky V on next? My favorite part of that movie, hell maybe the entire franchise, is when Tommy Morrison gets AIDS.
Dear lord, Rocky V is beyond an awful movie. Had forgotten how bad it was as compared to Rocky IV. #iwillbreakyou
Although Rocky V sucks there is one part in the movie I actually like and that is when Adrian owns that black businessman.
Rocky V is on tv. Why did they make this movie?
Rocky V is playing on AMC. American: check. Movie: check. Classic? Oh hell no. Rocky V is the worst of all the Rocky films.
Rocky V is on. The shittiest movie of the series. Even the last Rocky is better than the fifth one.

I just made it to the first commercial break before I couldn't stand any more of Rocky V. That is one horrendous movie
Rocky kicked the soviets ass and was such a bad ass on IV. In V, he was not good and most of the movie was about his son. Rocky IV > Rocky V
Rocky V is an unbelievably horrible movie. Tommy Gunns?? Come on now.

Watching Rocky V. What awesome movie with one of the best actors at 80-90's!
We've just watched Rocky V. That movie is so phenomenally bad I'm making us watch Rocky Balboa in a minute to help forget 5 was ever made.
So Rocky V ends with a badly choreographed street fight that almost certainly aggravates his existing brain damage. Terrible movie.
Rocky IV was a great movie, but I think Rocky V was the best Rocky movie ever. #scottiepippentweets

Speaking of Rocky V, you'd be hard-pressed to find an Elton John song featured in a Stallone movie nowadays. http://youtu.be/E4J-23XKYXk
Rocky IV is the only Rocky movie I've actually seen... Wait, no, I think I saw most of Rocky V as well.

Juss finished watching ROCKY V dats a bomb ass movie
my favorite movie series is on (Rocky) but its my least favorite one (Rocky V) i aint fading it....to showerville i go
Opinion of the day: Rocky V is a terrible movie.
Watching "Rocky Balboa". Thought it was a great movie to end the series. In my world, "Rocky V" doesn't exist.
Watchin Rocky V...awesome movie
Rocky V is on... Worst. Movie. Ever
I hate having to go to work while in the middle of a Rocky movie. Even if it is Rocky V.

haha @jerryc_ferrara RT @Reeser1989: Anyone realize that E from #Entourage (Kevin Connolly) is in Rocky V? First movie he ever did.
jesus christ rocky V is horrible, i never really realized how bad that movie was
Rocky VI (or Rocky Balboa). As a movie, I think it was one of the greatest. However, Rocky V still had one of the best fights I've seen.
MOVIE TRIVIA: Did you know Sylvester Stallone won an honorary Oscar for "Best John Rambo?" (for Rocky V)
Just out of school, Kirman was tapped to be a casting director for “Rocky V.” She enjoyed the work and never left the movie industry. ...

#nowplaying （ ＾ω＾）♪That's What I Said from "Rocky V" by Movie
oh no. Rocky V is about to come on. YAY but *sad face* that was the movie that the ex & I fell asleep to the last time we slept side by side
Glad to learn that Sly Stallone also thinks Rocky V is a poor movie. This is brutal.
Help! My dad is making me watch a crappy movie with Sylvester Stallone! (Not Rocky V)

How about Rocky V Rambo? RT @leighfeldman3: I've got a movie idea! Rocky 7 and/or Rambo 5.
RT @DaRealMrC: At home watching ROCKY 4<OMG that's my fav movie of all time! Rocky v Drago best Ro0ky ever!
Like how Rocky V was a cross of Rocky III and Superman IV !! RT @alyankovic: I see a cross of Shrek2 n Shrek4 @badbanana:Movie idea Shrek 5.
In the immortal words of Paulie Pennino in the movie Rocky V: "I need alcohol".
Things needed to pump me up: any given Rocky movie (except Rocky V) accompanied by a montage and appropriate theme music.
@ChristyRae75 Exactly how I feel. Rocky V was awful, was so glad they were able to get one final good movie out of the series.
@elguapo1 @FredTopel awesomely makes no sense, but i'd watch that movie. rocky v apollo creed... v billy dee williams (as himself).
So, final verdict: #rockyiv is thus far the worst Rocky movie, but it has its perverse, idiotic charms. On to Rocky V! .....eventually.
I will forvever have a crush on Sly Stallone & Rocky Balboa will forever be my favorite movie character (I've forgiven him for Rocky V)

Movie sequels that NEVER happened: Rocky V, Godfather 3 and, now on Spike, Predator II (which is weird because it NEVER happened)
@JordanWellin I would never crucify anyone for liking a movie. (Unless that movie is Rocky V. You like Rocky V, we got a beef. )

Great movie. I should watch Rocky V now, but got things to do. So I'll finish V and VI tomorrow.
I wish I didn't know there was a Rocky V and VI. Cause I'd really think he'd die in this movie. Maybe the last two are prequels?
@ImMattGiraud Spiderman 3, Wolverine and Rocky V. Oh, and The Aviator. No one i know likes this movie, but i LOVE it.
The music from Rocky made those films... Rocky V by far the worst movie and worst soundtrack!!
2nd movie: Rocky V....eh
@sportsguy33 never thought a sports movie could be worse than Rocky IV. Then they made Rocky V.

Listening to some Rocky Songs. Not really a fan of Elton Johns but 'Measure of a man' is perfect for the end of Rocky V -makes the movie tbf
Watched Rocky V last night....awesome movie
Rocky V finished.. the only thing worth wild about this movie is the credits montage in the end with Elton John's "measure of a man" playing
god Rocky V is a bad movie. seriously.
Rocky V was by far the worst Rocky movie. Slow burning all the way
ughhh, rocky V is the worst movie ever
ok so Rocky V was just too bad so I've switched to South Park movie on comedy central...they are letting them say FUCK on cable!

@sportsguy33 that movie was never made, just like Rocky V. Move along folks nothing to see here
