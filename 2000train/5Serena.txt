I may have turned a corner watching this Christmas movie, cuz I emotionally identify w the MOM whose adult daughter is the main character.
If you want the definition of a crazy girlfriend then watch the movie Serena on Netflix

Mockingjay part 2 got me fucked up the whole movie
Book Vine meets tomorrow at Noon. They will be viewing the movie "Serena" based on the novel by Ron Rash. http://fb.me/3fIVqaasy 
Basically every movie that’s not Serena or Last House is a “Top Jennifer Lawrence Movie” & those movies BARELY count. The girl doesn’t miss.
I sincerely don't understand how Serena didn't have a better reception. This movie is so good.
that's like casting miley cyrus for a movie about serena williams
Mom: but what's the movie about? (Asking about Serena) The post painful question I've ever got asked :')

If you want to watch a movie with zero plot and comprised of 90% Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence sex scenes, then Serena is for you
If you don't know what the movie balto is, you should just go revaluate your childhood

Bradley Cooper has had 3 box office bombs in a row: Serena, Aloha & Burnt. If not for American Sniper his movie career would be on the brink
"Serena" (2015) is a waste of time for an audience who deserves better than this movie (F) #AhiMovieReviews <nx3ezm>
that 'serena' movie is absolutely awful
If you're ever thinking about watching the movie Serena, don't.

If I had to describe my life with one movie it would be "he's just not that into you"
Serena also used to date Brett Ratner, who is like the Reddit of movie directors.
Yesterday Serena was having Drake's baby. Today she's dating the Reddit guy. I can only hope both are true and there's a Lifetime movie.

Even if I have watched the movie a million times whenever someone is being chased I have anxiety
I'm watching a movie called Serena starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence...I love it
Where is @ExtraCrispi at when I decide to watch a scary movie alone??
This 20th Anniversary Sailor Moon project better be a movie w/college age Serena so I don't feel like a creep as the inevitable Tuxedo Mask.

Watching 'Serena' on netflix. I don't think I have ever seen a movie go downhill so fast. Wtf.
@JosyLentner the worst movie I've ever seen by far
This movie is making me miss Serena
Horror movie dekh lo Ya Serena Williams ko dekh lo, 1 e baat ha
Champs !!!Everyone in this movie! Sick!! Briliant incite to how boxing changes all there lives!! Wicked movie #champs
Serena is a good movie and Netflix's rating is 2/5 so I gave it 5/5
Olaf, Tyrion Lannister, Ned Stark, The creator of Pacman, Aunt Petunia and Serena Williams in one movie!?!? @PixelsMovie
Can someone explain to me the thought process of who ever wrote the movie Serena? Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence should hit but...
idk what movie to watch
@VicenxuPalauet Serena will rise again. We have seen this movie before. She learns from her loses. more records in 2016. #ThanksSerena
It could be worse Could've been a Korra movie with Serena Williams as- Wait a minute
Just saw an ad with Serena williams and her head is kind of shaped like those walking monster things on super mario brothers movie.
Who would you want to play you in the movie of your life? Serena Williams for the story of Sope because she too is a spoilt younger sister!
Honestly was expecting the movie Serena to be awfully romantic... But nooooo...It's awfully tragic.. Jesus..
The three movies I rented for my movie day are Aloha, American Sniper, and Serena. Can you tell I love Bradley Cooper?
lazy movie family day plus popcorn, sushi and chili is my definition of perfection
First the Drake curse got Serena. Then, Micheal Ealy's movie. And then C. Breezy found out that Kawashima got a new boo. Moment of silence
Serena:aww I love that movie Me:what movie Serena:........Bratz Me: do you know every single line or something Serena:noo @seerenah
@Serena_is_trill you actually liked a scary movie ?? pic.twitter.com/go5AHjKZUU
@Kimibabyy2013 come to AK and I'll take you to any movie you want!
@sabrinaraesingz i would but Christian and Serena already saw a movie today lol
It's with a heavy heart that I have to announce I'm pulling out of the 48hr movie challenge. Serena's defeat was too much to bear.
Watching Serena bash that tennis racket on the ground was seriously more startling than any scary movie I've ever seen
If this was a Disney movie some dude would come running with a stack of papers out of breath talking about how Serena won on a technicality
Still stunned. When Serena went up 2-0 in the third set I thought I knew the rest of the movie by heart. I was very wrong.
First, Drake is being blamed for Serena losing. And tonight, Michael Ealy's crazy movie drops. The light skin winning streak is over.
I agree! When they make the Serena movie in the future, it will be amazing. A life of highs and lows. https://twitter.com/notlilmsunshine/status/642416175012544512 …
Looks like Vinci deciphered the Serena Code. Get it? Like that book and movie. You don’t get it.
Serena took the L, that Zoe Saldana Nina Simone movie is actually coming out, next door market is out of carrot cake. Smh, trash everywhere
@Slimriffic "I'm watching Serena" me: that's my favorite movie. Jujube: I said Serena not Selena
Serena is amazing, I haven't wanted someone to win so badly since the movie Miracle came out
This Serena - Vinci match is more dramatic than a Meryl Streep movie... and you know it'll also meet the tears quota. #USOpen
Just finished #Serena and can confirm- the movie did not do it justice.
What a Tragedy... Serena(Movie)
It's either Drake is about to appear in a movie/series, I can't believe he gained all that weight because of Serena.
But actually serena williams is straight outta compton i thought the movie would be about her & venus
i thought they were making a movie about serena williams' life but it was just a gatorade commercial
Compton has been relevant for the past month..from the movie to the superstars Venus & Serena Williams.
@BradATerrell they are Also in a movie called "Serena" together that came out on Netflix recently, I heard it's pretty good!
The movie Serena, is the most depressing shit ever do not watch it
Watching Serena vs Venus is like watching a movie
@thegynomite I swear Serena shld be an Avenger in the next Marvel movie. Not even as a Marvel character, just Serena & the Avengers
Cool beans that Ronda Rousey tapped to star in Road House remake. Makes me question if Serena is turning down movie roles or....
but can serena williams get her own movie though?
Dear @lifetimetv when are you guys going to come out with the Venus and Serena movie?
silence of the lambs will forever be my favorite movie

So who gon play Venus and Serena in their bio movie?
The Serena Venus movie that releases in 12 years better be fire
To Pimp A Butterfly, NWA movie, Venus & Serena, Dr. Dre album, COMPTON is clearly winning 2015.
Serena, Serennnnnaaaaa you remind me of a westside story. Growing up in the bay area, she living her life just like a movie star ohhh. Lhh
Watching Serena and Venus is like watching the movie Warrior all over again
Serena N Venus They From Compton N The Movie Straight Out Of Compton Was A Success Damn Compton Putting On
#AMAZING! #Venus & #Serena. Watching history on TV. #USOPEN. As 1 of 3 sisters, it's complex. Must be a movie! Watched docu. Love them both!
The #StraightOuttaCompton movie should be redone and be about Venus & Serena. That would be a great movie. #USOpen
VENUS & SERENA WILLIAMS U.S. OPEN MATCH COMPTON's GREATEST CONTRIBUTION TO THE NWA MOVIE/DR DRE ALBUM ROLL OUT
this is a motion picture movie studio biopic in the making. Serena played by Gabby Douglas. #VenusandSerena #USOpen
Venus and Serena fix every match they play. It's kind of like a movie when they are out there
LMAO! Paige lying there reminded me of a really bad horror movie. Now Serena on the other hand...that one shook me up. #Days
They Gotta Make A Movie About Serena & Venus It's Only Right
Woulda been better to make a movie called Straight Outta Compton that's actually just about Venus and Serena.
If Serena nd Venus Williams were to make a movie... I swear they needa get K. Michelle to play Serena lol!!!
really don’t think Ron Howard would be the right director for the Serena-Venus movie.

Action movie about clone soldiers replicated from Serena Williams DNA. ENTIRE ALIEN ARMADAS DIE TO RETURNED GRENADES.
This boy thought the movie Straight Outta Compton was a movie about tennis staring Serena Williams
@CaroFederista you didn't watch their movie?? "Venus and Serena" you gotta watch that
I know movie directors will be all over a Venus and Serena Williams biopic.
1.13 Serena: You act like you're in this movie about your perfect life, then I have to remind you the only one watching that movie is you.
I wonder how Serena and Venus Williams felt about the Straight Outta Compton movie

Can Gatorade make that Serena commercial into a movie?
Sorry, but my Serena Williams highlight this summer was her appearance in an Adam Sandler movie Pixels. (Guess I need to watch more tennis!)

When Serena goes to see a movie you've been wanting to see with her without you cause she don't care about yo bum ass
Assuming our universe is a movie, Serena Williams is definitely the star and we're all just extras.
Watching Serena Williams play is like watching a movie..lots of action...suspense. ..she loses points… https://instagram.com/p/7Oy1d-nlaH/ 
Now I can continue seeing my movie...thank u lord,Serena Williams you're d winner of dis grand slam,u and Federer, it's already written...
Just watched that match like a horror movie, through my hands, because I could not bare to watch if Serena lost. #usopen #calendargrandslam
Serena Williams just wanted to add some dramatic tension to that movie about her life. Where she wins an Oscar playing herself.
@Serena_Solis yeah, but I haven't seen the movie in a while, so I kinda forgot it's accuracy. :
I've seen this Serena movie too many times. No one (save for Bencic) capable of sustaining through three sets this year. #USOpen
I have seen this movie before. All of us wringing our hands over how slowly Serena Williams has started, only for her to bulldoze through.
Serena letting this girl with "I shoot up movie theaters" hair give her the world of trouble. #USOpen
Serena tennis game reminds me of that Atilla dude from the movie LionHeart (before Van Damme showed up )
I see we're advertising a movie I've seen seven times (nine times if we count the two matches where Serena lost the second set).
i asked serena when she was 10 yrs old at a tournament once, what she wants to be when she grows up: a movie star. https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/639920926973366275 …
I'm going to watch Serena soon will I survive this movie again probably not.
the good part? it's the last Black/White movie, next we'll be seeing Serena (<3!), Clemont and Bonnie, yeah!
really wish there is a Williams movie to hit theatres one day. Serena out here making history. last calendar grandslam was done in 88 wow
@TonyFratto SERENA was so great. (Heard only blah things about the movie, alas....)

It's funny cause Serena wants to go to Brown and her character in the sisterhood books/movie went to Brown as well
I'm so disappointed. This movie freaking sucked pic.twitter.com/StgRzwHcF0

I would have liked Serena if they didn't completely mess up the end of the movie. Book is better pretty much always.
@lolwhoiskj I wanted to quote the it the clown movie thing but like I guess I clicked the Serena Williams one and quoted that
Serena is a horrible movie it's pissing me off the main characters die wtf is this
Im watching serena and now im scared im not understanding the movie this is so weird
Movie night?! @gbirmingham290 @serena_223
@serena_ilene that movie was so sad
@CherryBl00s0m OMG THATS MY MOVIE
Well, eventhough a lot of people said the movie was bad, I think it was ok. Bit of anti climatic though. Still better than Serena.
Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence in the movie "Serena" are real goals
Jerry Maguire is such a great movie.
petition for a gossip girl movie in which dan thinks he's a cool man but serena is cheating on him with the actual love of her life, nate.
@shagdalen "Serena is not an interesting or particularly enjoyable movie, and I cannot in good conscience recommend that you watch it" LOL
Comment of the day: "This is "thinking" movie, makes you think the whole time." - on "Serena"
Quick thought on Serena: She should be in the next Bond movie.
The song 'Let it Go' was not just made for a catchy song in a children's movie. It was for adults to think of when holding on to something.
Got out of my comfy bed to order tickets and reserve seats for a movie omg
If Marvel ever makes a She-Hulk movie Rhonda Rhousey or Serena Williams should get the lead role.
What's the deal with Serena Williams? Doesn't the movie have enough colleges? Who ARE these people?
Serena reminds me of the monstrous villain nobody can defeat except the hero in the movie but tennis has no heroes
Sheesh... Serena should be a superhero in a movie pic.twitter.com/S09xObKYud

Serena Williams have a cameo in the movie Pixels, Like STG I might go see it just because she in that movie!
When I watch a sad/cruel movie I expect it to at least have a happy ending... There was nothing damn happy about "Serena"
favorite jen movie? — silver linings playbook // winters bone // the poker house // serena http://ask.fm/a/cff3a2dh 
#Serena was a bad movie. Just boring, uneventful, awfully predictable, and lacked a real storyline.
Shout out to me for recording the Lizzie McGuire movie
Best song in this movie
1.13 Serena: You act like you're in this movie about your perfect life, then I have to remind you the only one watching that movie is you.
@Joshifer451 but i really like Susanne Bier's directing in Serena and really any movie she's done.

PSA the lizzie McGuire movie is on ABC family. You're welcome
My mom just told me the synopsis of Serena (that failed Bradley Cooper/Jennifer Lawrence movie) and it sounds so hilariously bad.
@inbedwithRED On #Netflix Serena...loved it..and.. Lawless... If the movie isnt good I don't watch it all.
While we're at it, when are we getting a movie about Serena Williams? While she's still alive, thank you. I damn well WANT that movie.
Silver Linings Playbook is my favorite Bradlifer movie ever but Serena is bae too
@nippy02002 @Serena_hess @wonsugarkyub @020388K yes the media is totally off focus...pls focus on the movie and not the gossip
@Serena_hess watch a few vid,siwon always look away,director will tell reporters "dont ask" & eddie will talk abt movie to divert attention
Reporters, since you are so eager, please promote Siwon's movie to her, because Siwon doesn't care and doesn't want to talk to her.
@serenamaddenn @_alexxclarke Serena you wanna come to? This movie is going to be amazing. Alex you better be sharing the m&ms
The movie Serena had me like ?
if anyone wants to see a good movie it's Age of Adeline literally Serena Van Der Woodsen was so good in it
The acting in Serena was amazing especially from Jennifer Lawrence but the movie suffered from pacing and the script
Anyone watch this Serena movie with Katniss and Bradley Cooper?
Serena really could have been an excellent movie. But damn. What a shit show. Terrible, terrible editing.
Wow #Serena great movie Jennifer Lawrence & Bradley Cooper amazing actors they work amazing together ! Loved it .
I really don't think straight outta Compton is gunna be a good movie. It looks corny and cheap like the acting all that.
NETFLIX MOVIE RECOMMENDATION: Serena. Its kinda sad but HELLA good
#NowWatching Serena. Jennifer Lawrence is gorgeous as usual but this movie is booooringggg.

The only good thing about that movie was Serena Williams. She was stunning.
Serena is such a great movie with Jennifer Lawrence in it

#BradleyCooper told #JenniferLawrence he thinks they should get married. They just met. On horseback. Wait--is this a Disney movie? #Serena
Hoping they do a Gossip Girl movie where Serena divorces Dan and marries Nate instead as it should have been.
The movie Serena is a million times better when you imagine it's the prequel to Silver Linings Playbook..

This Serena movie about to put me in my feelings
"Kevin James was president and a midget was dating Serena Williams, I feel like that whole movie was just one giant trip"
Dad: *walks in room* "wanna watch Sharknado 3 with me?" Me: "wtf that movie is dumb" Dad: *walks out and asks Serena*
my favorite part about Pixels was that Kevin James was the president and he wore a suit most of the movie and Serena Williams was in it
I'm terrible at tweeting lately, but here's a late and unpopular opinion: I really liked the movie Serena.
Last year I traveled to Toronto to do Serena's makeup for this movie!!! One of the best work trips… https://instagram.com/p/5slL1Zj5Ve/

@beccapadgett2 EXACTLY! Serena's bat shit crazy so that messes with your head. So it's a movie about a crazy person you've never heard of.
So...um....is Serena not going to make our plans to see the Minion movie tonight?
I'm 40 min into this movie called Serena with Jennifer Lawrence & Bradley Cooper & I still have no idea what this movie is about
Serena is such a beautiful movie.
Just a little something from my next film "Serena". #shortfilm #movie #losangeles #kellypackard… https://instagram.com/p/5Sn_MgmzAN/ 
Jab Tak Hai Jaan is my new favourite Bollywood movie
Serena is such a horrible boring movie. J-Law & Cooper should have never signed up for it omg
i didnt even sleep last night but i swear my eyes were closed for two hours straight bc i heard mariela and serena watching a vagina movie
Me and Serena were watching a cool weird movie yesterday about a monster vagina
Serena! Is! Such! A! Sad! Movie!
@PnubK1 I'm pretty sure the only explosions in the movie Serena are the metaphorical kind...maybe.
Blake Lively will always be Serena to me no matter the commercial or movie that she's in
I held Serena's hand throughout the whole movie yesterday
@BekahLomeli @Ashton5SOS YEA YOU SHOULD TOTALLY "GALLOW" US. I JUST SAW THAT MOVIE I DONT WANT TO BE "GALLOWED" SORRY
SERENA IS THE CRAZIEST MOVIE OF LIFE MAN
Serena is sad movie
Just now watching the movie Serena and it's literally so good
Serena is on netflix?! I've been trying to watch this movie for a while
The movie "Serena" has bad ratings but I'm still gonna give it a try bc I loved Bradley Cooper&Jennifer Lawrence on Silver Linings Playbook
I think I just watched the whole nacho libre movie on Serena's sc story
Sadly, I see why #Serena the movie didn't do very well.... #betterlucknexttime
Wtf I read the book Serena and now it's a movie?? awesome
. @atima_omara @jbey @ZerlinaMaxwell We cover girl, ESPY, and movie Ronda Rousey's muscles, but on Serena they're "like a man.:
Movie Serena- skip it. Not worth watching. Waste of time.
Has anyone seen the "Serena" movie!? Watched it today, omg it was freaking crazy

When you're looking through Netflix and see a movie called "Serena"
Just watched the movie #SERENA and I feel some type of way. I just don't know what that type of way is....
Okay yeah Serena was actually a pretty good movie despite the two stars on Netflix.
This movie is called Serena, but she seems like just another character. #SerenaMovie
This movie "Serena" with Bradley Cooper and JLaw is absolutely horrible. Their on-camera relationship is put-on and fake. Plot stinks.
Serena is a really good movie on Netflix btw
Bradley Cooper in the movie Serena
This Serena movie is twisted as all hell
This movie #Serena is the 1929 version of #GoneGirl
about to watch that Serena movie on Netflix just cause I love Jennifer Lawrence
Yeah...this movie is kind of all over the place? And by all over the place I mean trash #Serena
@Itsjslaw and @BradleyCooperPA wow Serena was the worst movie I've ever seen. Saw half, barfed, pressed on further, but couldn't finish
The movie Serena is terrible, no wonder it's on Netflix so soon. But JL and BC I still love you! #StupidMovie
Serena is the worst movie of all time. J-Law is my girl and all, but man... That was just not good.
Should I watch that movie "Serena" with Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper or go outside and lick the curb?

An action movie starring Venus and Serena Williams with Idris Elba as their butler. I'll take my money now, Hollywood.
Also who knew they made #Serena into a movie, much less that it's already on @Netflix. I love #JenniferLawrence!
Serena is a good movie

This Serena movie is great so far - the wife is fucking crazy
Serena could've been such a good movie bc Bradley cooper and Jennifer Lawrence :(
i can never watch another blake lively movie again because like NO, THATS SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN.

Wow..... "Serena" is a good movie!
Fun fact: the gun Bradley Cooper uses in Serena is just like one of my faves up at the farm. (Also- this movie is less than great)
The shit from all 12 confusing subplots just hit the fan 1 hr and 20 min into the movie #Serena
How does a third movie starring Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence go straight to video? #Serena #themovienotthetennisplayer

Jennifer Lawrence & Bradley Cooper sure are a damn good couple on screen. Just watched #Serena. Nice slow movie w an indie feel. I like. :)
So disappointed with Serena the movie. Not like the book. The BEGINNING and the ENDING completely different. #TheBookIsBetter
What? 99% of Serena (movie) was different from the book. The entire sequence of events were chopped and rearranged. Some events invented
Well Serena is officially the most depressing movie on Netflix
the amy winehouse movie broke my heart. I have the feels now
I highly recommend the movie Serena on Netflix
About to start watching Serena on Netflix. I loved the book so I don't have high hopes for the movie. We will see! #BooksAreBetter #Always
there's a 1 star Bradley Cooper/J Law movie on Netflix called Serena i've never heard of it and it looks terrible pic.twitter.com/KCoMVd6iUn
Serena is one twisted & crazy movie I love it though
@GothSiren @worshipwarship @tristankurtz when Tyra was in a holocaust movie and Serena was her assistant tho
Watching Serena and all I can think about is how every movie should have JLaw and Bradley Cooper in it
Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in Serena. This movie is a gift.
@lawrencexswift I was gonna say, if you have it, Serena's now on it. If you don't, I wouldn't spend money on buying/renting the movie. Haha!
I didn't think JLaw and BCoop could make a bad movie, then I saw Serena. Not a better love story than Twilight.
"Serena" is definitely a movie to watch!!!!!
@DCComics can you please make a Wonder Woman movie with Serena Williams playing Wonder Woman
Time to watch "Serena"! Hoping the movie's better than the book. Movie has at least one promising factor-- Jennifer Lawrence.
@THGPickMeUp Serena is a very good movie, one of my favorites. Enjoy!
@Joshifer451 The pleasure's all mine! Great movie. I'm about to watch "Serena" for the first time. =]
#Serena the movie is fucking awesome - "the panther tears the chest open and eats the heart first"....

Watching "Serena" this movie is so hilariously terrible.

At some point I'll read the book, see the movie & report back. #Serena is on Netflix now I think. The book need to be the next book I read.
I just read the back of the book that J-Law's movie Serena is based on. Plot sounds intense. Surprised the movie flew under the radar.

Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence star in Serena. You keep asking yourself, "Why are these guys in this movie?" Don't watch it.
@adolforivera_ oh my grapes I have never heard of that movie
@serena_serena13 it's from a movie

movie Serena is good.
my mom picked a movie for me so now i'm watching serena so this is another movie starring bradley cooper that i'm watching today
Well Serena the movie was definitely worse than the book, by a LOT
Still dying at the dude that said if they make a Serena Williams movie, Ving Rhames should play her lol..
- @HeyYoJos they'll make a Serena movie showing her successes over the years....and the movie will end with her marrying a white man
Serena is a really good movie and I highly recommend it if you have Netflix
@nehneh22 have you seen 7 Days in Hell? It's about Wimbledon & Serena is in it. It's a short movie starring Andy Samberg & Kit Harrington.

Movie recommendation of the night: "Serena." A film which includes Jennifer Lawrence training an eagle to kill snakes. So there's that.
So far i have watched Serena, The Rugrats Movie, Pocahontas II, Wild Thornberry Movie & now Hey Arnold Movie!
Up is such a good movie
LMFAO RT @DosRivers: When they make a Serena Williams movie, Ving Rhames is gonna play Serena.
Serena Williams looks like that one black lady boxer from scary movie 4.
On top of being, y'know, GOAT-worthy, Serena Williams turns out to be surprisingly great at deadpan in that Andy Samberg HBO movie. Love.

Maria Sharapov makes more in endorsements than Serena & bum ass Micky Ward has an Academy Award winning movie based on his life....

Glad JK Rowling is a fan of Serena. Now if we could just get a Black female co-lead in her movie adaptations *sips tea*
When Serena is playing u feel like u'r watching old cassette tapes.U've seen tht movie b4,..
Imagine a young black girl right now who will one day grow up to portray a silver screen Serena Williams in a movie hopefully titled "Love."
If we don't get a Serena Williams bio pic movie in the next 3 decades I'll be surprised
Mortdecai another reason why we need another Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Johnny Depp is the Serena of the Big Screens.
If they ever made a superwoman movie, i feel like serena williams would make a pretty good superwoman..
Serena probably has a sunglasses receptacle right outside her trophy room...just like a 3D movie
Serena wins again! Who is going to make a movie about her? #SerenaSlam #Wimbledon2015
@aishaonsando @IvyWairimu when they make THE SERENA WILLIAMS MOVIE and they will; that casting better be on point!

Serena, Serena, she reminds me of the West Side Story. Growing up in South Central, she's living the life just like a movie star...

When are they gonna make a movie about Serena ?
Serena the book was so good and the movie just ruined it even with JLaw and BCooper in it
When they make a movie about Serena's dominance, @TheRock is going to have to play Serena. If he bulks up a tad. pic.twitter.com/enOY5HgbKQ
Last time Sharapova beat Serena... #1 song in the U.S. -- "Burn" - Usher #1 movie in box office -- Spider Man 2 Gas Prices -- $2.56
It's like... I've seen this movie before. But anyway, I'm glad I got to watch Serena play live! I'll be at work during the Finals. :(
We need a biopic or movie about the dominance of Serena & Venus Williams. Papa Joe laid a masterful youth foundation in their game
Serena's mom looks like Serena is trying to go see a movie #masterofdisguise pic.twitter.com/QK5IvuGu6u

Serena is DOMINATING the second best player in the world like she's that far ahead of the rest of the pack... STILL
Part 25 of the horror movie that is Serena Williams Murders Maria Sharapova. #Wimbledon #dejavu
Watching Sharapova vs Serena Williams is much like watching a porn movie and a silent movie together. So much grunting by Sharapova.

Just walked in the house & thought @jenn22smith was watching some dodgy Porn Movie. Turns out it's just Serena Williams squealing like a hog
@FortyDeuceTwits I could watch it a million times. Only the Maria versus Serena movie is more favored.
After watching the movie Lone Survivor,my attention goes to the centre court...go Serena #Wimbledon2015
Why do I feel like I've already seen this movie? #Serena #Wimbledon
@BenRothenberg more specifically the Serena/Vika movie. Serena going 3 is not recently that much fun. See RG15...
That movie you've seen a million times but watch anyway because it's so well written and acted? That's Serena Williams. Going 3. #Wimbledon
I though they were breaking up!Never scare us like that again @janoskians and The movie gonna be heaven on a disk like @janosmoodswing said
@vika7 choking again after going up a set to Serena... I've seen this movie 30 times

I hope when the "Venus and Serena" movie comes out, they won't make "Venus" out to be some jealous envious lunatic - that would be a crime
The Serena vs Venus Wimbeldon match was actually just a scene from the new Batman vs Superman movie.

Serena is never dead. She comes back to life like some horror movie character. Every. Time.
What's the deal with Serena? Do you trailer me? Am I Williams? Am I an actual movie? Just what am I?
Woah... That Serena intro was intense. I'm about to scream and cry! Lol. It was like a movie

I'd be interested in reading someone's thoughts/analysis on harmful gender roles & mental health related to this movie/time period. #Serena
Cooper on the other hand just seemed really meh in this movie. Like, super generic scruffy dude in a leading man part #347. #Serena
Selma won Best Movie, Serena Williams won Sportswoman, Steph Curry won Sportsman, Lecrae won Best Gospel, Mo'ne Davis won Youngstars
Movie, "Serena". 4.5 out of 5 stars. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper work so well together. Love the chemistry.
Serena (14, C–): Odd case of a movie either too discombobulated or not enough so. Soap-operatic incident flattened by uninflected direction.
I can watch The Dark Night Rises a million times and never get sick of this movie

Movie marathon ★ Serena — https://path.com/p/3fUVOX 
Watching Serena on her new movie with my Blair aikamalaika #movienight #ageofadaline #serena… https://instagram.com/p/4JtQapCOzb/ 
#InsideOut is basically the coolest kid movie ever, on so many levels. Like, at least 5 levels. At least.
I'm sorry but Serena is the most boring confusing awkward senseless weird movie I've ever not paid attention to.
When Serena wants to have a "movie night" but she turns on the Dodgers game
so far Serena is the worst movie ever
I may or may not have just rented the movie Serena just because the title is my name ....
I am very excited, I want to see Pitch Perfect 2 ... did you see the movie @jackie_emerson ?
What exactly did Serena play in the Pixel movie? I don't see her in the ad yet and I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler
The movie was literally perf, but I'm going to read Serena from the beginning...
What a great movie screening last night here at #cayfilm #GrandCayman we saw Serena. Can't wait to see what today holds
Rent is the first movie/musical that has made me cry the first time I watched it. I'm becoming soft.
I think the result would be a great movie with Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova pic.twitter.com/q12ARxBSwU
Movie then
serena is an asshole she should make the scariest movie
serena was the weirdest movie ever
serena tellin me how this girls laugh is so annoying that it ruined a movie then she says she has the same laugh as me
Fear is a brazy ass movie

Best way to start a movie: Some scenic design then a straight shot of Bradley Cooper. #Serena
SERENA IS SUCHA FUCKED UP BUT GOOD MOVIE!! WHY DIDNT JENNIFER LAWRENCE WANT US TO SEE IT?!?
I haven't been on a movie date in forever and I'm finally going on one with Serena
@Colombiana1202 I feel like that's what the one movie with the perfect guy is gonna be like bc the previews were so freakin good
#Serena is a boring movie
I am multitasking by blogging and watching a movie. I would say read Ron Rash's novel Serena instead of watching the movie!

I've had the biggest head ache all day. I need chocolate milk and a movie date to make me feel better.
Serena aka Blake lively was super amazing in the age of adaline Like dude the movie was AAMAZING
@bradliferschild Serena's problem couldnt be fixed by A-list stars. The problem with that movie is the editing. Bradlifer did their job well

Serena is an amazing movie, very deep but very good. I also think it's Oscar worthy for both Jen and Bradley.
seeing blake lively in that trailer for her new movie and all i see is serena van der woodsen

I think I spend more time trying to find a movie on Netflix then actually watching one
Adaline is basically a well-mannered Serena from #GossipGirl. would be a more fun movie if she was her character from The Town #AgeOfAdaline
I came with serena to an earlier release movie and it's a freaking girl movie! WOW
@magicmikemovie hi how do I get ready for this movie cuz I don't think I can handle this #ComeAgain #MagicMikeXXL
Serena is just such an amazing movie - quiet, sad and intense but still beautiful, stunning and very atmospherical - All at the same time.
Can we appreciate Callan McAuliffe as Bryce Loski in that movie though? pic.twitter.com/akgkegQVFV
@Serena_is_small god that book/movie was so good and also killed me. i never felt closure
Also, the book Flipped is really good. So was the movie.
