Trailer Watch: Which movie should you go see this weekend? - http://jrnl.ie/2501319 
If you could play in one movie, which one would it be? @flawlessrobz @kellanlutz #IMDbAskKellan
If you are lonely, dim all lights and put on a horror-movie. After a while it won’t feel like you are alone anymore.
I remember the 1st #StarWars movie like it was yesterday. I was only 58! Just a kid enjoying a movie lol.
I didn't have any of the movie spoiled for me, but it still upsets me that people are posting them. I will continue to block you if you do.

We're heading out of the office to go see some movie. Apparently it's a big deal. Happy Friday!!!

It's my review of film #Dilwale http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGCa6cO-kqQ&sns=tw … via youtube
That was a good tweet because it a) mentions a current holiday b) references a current movie c) includes a picture d) was wildly inaccurate.
Spoiler alert.. In the movie @starwars they make it appear that being #JediMindTricked is painful., but in real life it's pretty enjoyable!

For those who tried to spoil the movie... Not even close. I found the knowledge of what was gonna happen made it even more awesome.
Headed out to see the new Star Wars movie, anyone else plan on seeing it tonight/this weekend?!
That was a genuinely great movie. Star Wars has become a shared mythology for us--Abrams both honored and expanded it.
If I see someone tweet about Star Wars & ruining the movie before I see it, I will fight you.
When a movie starts on TV & you just want to watch the beginning but end up getting really into it Me rn
Mad Max was just too good for any movie in 2015 to surpass it in terms of action and intensity. Set the bar just too high on everything.
Everyone's pumped about the Star Wars movie and I've never seen a single one of 'em...yeah I said it

Must be weird to make a movie that's slightly a letdown if it doesn't make, literally, a billion dollars.
So Planned Parenthood is funded, no cuts are made, and it faces no consequences at all. It seems the bad guys always win in this movie.

I have a confession. I have not watched a single Star Wars movie in the history of mankind and I'm okay with it.
"It's been years since the last Iron Man movie." Ok but it's been an entire existence since the last Black Panther movie.
@Gurmeetramrahim @MSGTheFilm is 13 weeks old movie and still ruling on silver screen!!!! #WowMSG2 It's really amazing !!!!

Spoiler: Dilwale doesn't have an interval, it has a 10 mins video of SRK promoting second half of his movie Dilwale.
The movie rewards you more the less you know coming in. For once, people should just stop trying to outsmart a movie and just enjoy it.
I've only seen the first Harry Potter movie and I think it's safe to assume that nothing that happens in the other 15 of them is interesting
People complaining about where Dolly shot her movie? Really? I thought it was great! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!
If you are lonely, dim all lights and put on a horror-movie. After a while it won’t feel like you are alone anymore.
Krampus wasnt really what i expected at all. I wouldnt really recommend it.(Personally) but Still had a great time at the movie theater. (:

Falling asleep watching the Godzilla movie from 1998. One of my favorite movies as a kid. Probably seen it 50+ times.
if you label your youtube video"(movie) TRAILER!" and it starts with your dumb face saying "hey whats up guys", please just kill yourself.
It's so cute how you say your favorite movie is The Godfather, but you mispronounce it The Big Lebowski.
Also involves feelings of melancholy & estrangement, ends with a miracle reuniting a family. It's a Christmas movie. https://twitter.com/Rover537/status/676224883261579265 …

#DidYouKnow: Every ticket in the movie has 1225 on it. 1225 was the model number of a train, and is also the date of Christmas (12-25).
@Tru3000 @NBAPickUp no way. It's that guy Jimmy Chitwood from Hoosiers. He never missed a shot in that movie!

I would love to have the time to waste on speculating/worrying if a movie/game/show will be good or not. It's minutia. All of it. Pointless.
I'm really glad I didn't watch the Krampus trailers before the movie. It would have spoiled a lot of the fun.
Don't go see the movie Krampus it's a big waste of your time and money

Avery's eyes are always glued to the TV screen when I play Mr. Peabody & Sherman. it's her favorite movie so far.
@AliceLoweecey I did! I recommend it. It didn't go "far" enough for me, but the spirit was there. We see every holiday movie, horror or no.
Never listened to it outside the movie until now, but Herrmann's "North by Northwest" score is a fantastic piece of work.
