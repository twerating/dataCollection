The Godfather: Movie Review (10/10) + Immersive story + Amazing acting & camera work.
"The Godfather isn't a gangster movie. It's just a movie about family and business." I'm scared of my uncle now...
All day marathon of the Godfather on AMC tomorrow. Best movie ever!
The #Godfather is such a great movie that everyone starts talking mafia style after its done.
Someone asked for favorite gangster movies and someone else asked "does THE GODFATHER count as a gangster movie? if so, that would be mine"

Need a movie to watch tonight. Any suggestions? No Matt, I'm not watching The Godfather.
i just spent 2 hrs watching a documentary on The Godfather. i've never seen the movie.
As much as I love LOTR, HP and the Godfather. As a movie trilogy, The Matrix is something else. Not only as a film but as a philosophy.
I never could understand what the Godfather is saying in the movie "Godfather". Lol
The Godfather is not a movie. It's a landmark event in human history.
I am watching a docu where historians talk about The Godfather trilogy, which is a fictional movie, but here we are
i cant get into those movie series that have huge followings like star wars star trek lotr the godfather
The Godfather may be the best movie.
