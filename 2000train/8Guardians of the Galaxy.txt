Look me in the eye and tell me that Guardians of the Galaxy isn't the best marvel movie. Say the avengers is good and I will laugh at you.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/QupTPGVn1pM?a  Guardians of the Galaxy - Movie Review
Guardians Of the Galaxy isn't a superhero movie, it's a space opera. That's why it's so different and special and the love of our lives.
The end of guardians of the galaxy when baby groot is dancing but stops when someone looks at him might be the best part of the movie .
I really do LOVE Guardians of the Galaxy - what an awesome movie!
Guardians of the galaxy is actually such an awesome movie

Jupiter Ascending was basically the same movie as Guardians of the Galaxy. People miss that as it PRETENDS to take itself seriously.
I asked my mom what guardians of the Galaxy is about since it's her face movie and she was like "...about guardians guarding the Galaxy" THX
Guardians of the Galaxy is such a good movie!
guardians of the galaxy sound track is without doubt the best movie sound track I've everheard
Me: Hmm what movie should I watch? Me: *starts humming Guardians of the Galaxy theme song* Me: Well, glad that's been decided.
@GeekheadAaron But I'm also not a big movie person. Last new movies I've seen was Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't get out much.
Guardians of the galaxy is the best movie
Guardians of the galaxy is still my favorite marvel movie so far.
Another god damn Captain America movie? Pretty fed up with all these superhero movies. I'm only here for Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
@T_mel88 @kevspeck I agree, winter soldier is a great movie.But Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy & Ant Man (a real surprise) are up there!

eeeeh I guess " @C_Mbadu: A movie score is more Hans Zimmer and a soundtrack is more Guardians of the Galaxy neh?"
"The Martian" is a very good movie. I just wish they had not tried to copy the soundtrack idea from Guardians of the Galaxy.
"What's the name of the movie with the furry thing with guns?" "Star Wars?" "Star Trek?" "Guardians of the Galaxy?" "My Little Pony?"
The Martian. Awesome. Haven't enjoyed a movie that much since Guardians of the Galaxy. Perfect Casting as well throughout entire film.
Watched Avengers 2, or as much as I could. Had an epiphany in the middle of it: Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite movie ever. No joke.
@Marvel @JamesGunn thanks for making the coolest movie of all time Guardians of the Galaxy, you have no idea how much your movie means to me
Heading out to see The Walk in IMAX 3D. First IMAX 3D movie since Guardians of the Galaxy.
Off to watch Guardians of the Galaxy for the fourth time because it's my favourite 'Bradley Cooper as a raccoon' movie

favorite line in Guardians of the Galaxy movie was when Starlord was dancing at the end and said: "I'm distracting you, turd blossom!"

@simonnash1980 same director as Guardians of The Galaxy but a proper B-movie
No one cared for Guardians of the galaxy in till a great movie was made. This is why Marvel needs to make a great Moon Knight Movie.
@AntMan was awesome! It's now my favourite marvel movie along with Guardians of the Galaxy.Perfect blend of action & comedy!
I'm not even kidding, if you loved the Guardians of the Galaxy movie, don't watch the new cartoon… it shits the bed. Wet shit.

I think Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite Marvel movie.
I think "Guardians of the Galaxy" name suits the game "Destiny" more than the movie.
@Christydunks It makes me crazy. Every movie on Lifetime, Hallmark... I want to see the game or watch Guardians of the Galaxy for 50M time
Guardians of the Galaxy is such a good movie
If only Ant Man was as big as Guardians of the Galaxy. That movie still surprised people that it was a hit.
Why do I want to be an actor? Solely because I might get a role in a futute Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
