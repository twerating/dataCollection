7 movie franchises that need their own 'Mad Max: Fury Road' or #TheForceAwakens http://on.wsj.com/22e6taL  pic.twitter.com/SAUXMJaGcj
I do think "Fury Road" gets the relationship between action movies & ballet better than anything else. That movie is 85% choreography.
"Star Wars is gonna be like, the first movie in *ages* to put women up front in the action" Excuse u do u even Fury Road Bruh.
You guys. THE REVENANT IS THE BEST MOVIE. Maybe as great as Fury Road. Leo should win all the awards. And just put Tom Hardy in everything.

every time fury road gets nominated in the movie of the year category i gain 10 years of lifespan, my skin clears and my grades go up

..in fact, it was more-or-less EXACTLY like how FURY ROAD is an anti-patriarchy message movie *and* wall-to-wall brutal car-stunts.

Look harder and the divide between MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and SHAUN THE SHEEP MOVIE isn't so extreme.
Kung Fury. What a masterpiece. How did I not see this movie until now.
it's not that the Star Wars movie won't be good... it's just that IT CAN'T be better than MadMax Fury Road
Why 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the movie of the year http://lat.ms/1NS0yNT 
I'm usually easy on Obama but not choosing FURY ROAD as his favorite movie of the year might be worthy of impeachment.
i can't believe that hollywood is currently throwing original prints of every movie that ISNT fury road into a giant bonfire
watching mad max fury road for the 2nd time now : I love this movie !

It took me a really long time, but I finally watched Fury Road and I think it's the greatest action movie I've ever seen.
@UweStender I would say Fury Road was better, but that was more of an event than a movie.
I didn’t think it was possible for me to like a movie more than I liked Mad Max Fury Road this year. I was wrong. Creed is the real deal.
just watched Mad Max: Fury Road today. man that movie is overrated. It's an alright blockbuster with some stunning visuals, nothing more.

Mad max fury road seems more like just a really long scene from a movie....
@SUEtheTrex I suspect you'd enjoy about three minutes of Kung Fury. Spoiler: there's a T-Rex in it. Spoiler: the rest of the movie sucks.

Mad Max Fury Road is the best movie of 2015, Just give it the best picture Oscar already.
So Mad Max Fury Road was chosen as movie of the year? Last year, the same group chose A Most Violent Year. Apparently they hate scripts!
Fury Road was great but Road Warrior is still the best Mad Max movie.
god, kung fury is the most painfully cheesy movie ever.
@AwardsDaily Nope. Mad Max: Fury Road will take it. NBR unleashed the deep desire for critics to champion their darling movie of the year.
of course fury road is a top movie of 2015 who are we kidding here

I liked FURY ROAD okay, but if it's anyone's Best Movie of 2015, then that probably says a lot more about 2015 than about FURY ROAD.
If you haven't seen MAD MAX: FURY ROAD yet, then you're missing out on one of the most unique movie going experiences ever.

What's really going on in this Kung Fury movie? LMAOO... I can't deal.
It actually makes me angry to watch men dismissing Jessica Jones, while also assuring me that "Fury Road" is REALLY a movie about Nux.
Mad Max: Fury Road is a seriously sweet movie. It sets up a grim world with minimal dialogue and also has badass action scenes. Stupendous.
The parallels of Tyson Fury and the Jerry Maguire movie are madness #fairytail
Mad Max fury road is such a good movie!!!!
@joeavella I gotta agree with @BrettRedacted here on Fury Road. “not a horror movie, but fuck you.” It’s in my top-5 of 2015 easily.

I watched that Kung Fury movie. Pretty alright. Over the top reference filled randomness with that 80's vibe.

@Tyson_Fury please please please fight @TheCannonBriggs We want to see if he could do the movie ending.... #LetsGoChamp might be easy win!
At the mo' my 2015 Best of list is rly short: FURY ROAD, SICARIO, INSIDE OUT, now #CREED. See #CREED - as a movie, it's damn near flawless.
Just got back from Seeing Creed Probably the best movie I seen all year yes Even better then Fury Road
I think I know what Tyson Fury's favorite movie is: #klitschkofury pic.twitter.com/QbnppgEDBS
I'm basically just very excited that it's 2015 and the boxing Heavyweight Champion of the World is named Tyson Fury...and it's not a movie.

So the new heavyweight champion is named Tyson Fury. That is like a Rocky movie character. How timely. I hope he fights Dedrick Tatum.
What a great name the new champ has - Tyson Fury. Almost like the guy should be fighting Balboa in a Rocky movie..
Tyson Fury sang a love song from a Michael Bay movie. I want him to do the Ninja Turtle-Vanilla Ice ditty after his next fight.
I think Kung Fury might have just beaten Blades of Glory as my favorite movie of all time.
Tyson Fury sounds like he belongs in a rocky movie or in a wrestling ring...not heavyweight champ of Boxing.... #klitschkofury
I thought you're twitting about movie "Fury", Klitschko finally defeated!!!!
Just got done watching Fury with my brother and dad fantastic movie
Sod the Vardy story/movie, make a movie about Tyson Fury's life. World champ who lives in a caravan
Fury's singing Aerosmith's "Don't Want to Miss a Thing" right now & I'm wondering if this isn't a secret Will Ferrell movie. #klitschkofury
Yo. Tyson Fury is singing the Aerosmith song from that Asteroid movie in the middle of the ring. Boxing is the best.
Tyson Fury sounds like the name of a villain in a Rocky movie so I guess that guy chose the right profession
Boxing-obsessed roommate just told me 'Tyson Fury' did something. Don't know how that isn't name of a fictional boxer in the new Rocky movie

Tyson Fury sounds like a rapper name. Or a bad guy's name in a movie. Or a video game character. Not an about to be heavyweight champ.
Dudes name is Tyson Fury....sounds like a Carl Weathers B movie from the 80's...
End of an era? Klitschko has held some belt for about 27 yrs. Tyson Fury ..who looks like a bad guy in a TRANSPORTER movie..taking his title
Ended up having a John Wick and Mad Max:Fury Road double feature last night w/family Nothing like a tryptophan induced action movie marathon
Eighth round over and Fury was waving his arms about like a cross between being at a rave and Steven Seagal in an action movie. Zzzzz...
Klitschko looks like he can't figure out Tyson Fury's movie. He almost looks.....confused?
Finally saw Mad Max: Fury Road. Amazing movie. I'm exhausted just from watching all that constant action
Fury is an idiot, he thinks he's in a Rocky movie. Playing a lot of grabass too.

My 2 fav films of 2015 are surprisingly a remake and a sequel, "Mad Max:Fury Road" and "Boruto: Naruto The Movie".
@dresdencodak YOU KNOW, an Ewok movie set 20 years later that is essentially Fury Road would be amazing…
My dad watching the movie "Fury": "I like Bratt Pitt, but who's this Shia Lebeouf guy?" The world's still trying to figure that one out.
So, MAD MAX fury road is a good movie but I JUST don't think it's such a feminist movie like everyone insisted it is
Director George Miller had his wife, Margaret Sixel, edit "Mad Max: Fury Road" so it wouldn't look like every other action movie.

Just watched Interstellar for the first time. What a fucking movie! Too early to decide if it beats Mad Max: Fury Road for me, but maybe.

Going through movie channels and came across fury only to see Scott Eastwood get killed soon as I watch it like I just had a heartattack
Ex Machina is on Amazon Prime. Watch it, it's an extremely subversive, highly feminist, movie; infinitely more so than Mad Max: Fury Road.

Everyone watch Kung Fury on Netflix. Greatest. Movie. Ever.
Question: Do you think there a better movie this year than Mad Max: Fury Road?
"You could make a movie that was nothing but a series of asses getting kicked, and it would kick less ass than Mad Max: Fury Road"
Kung Fury for movie of the year
"I need a relaxing movie to make me forget that I'm stressed and worried about Thanksgiving and dreading Monday." *plays Fury Road…again*

Everyone needs to go watch Kung Fury on Netflix. Best movie I've ever seen.

Kung Fury is amazing. Probably the best movie of all time.

You ever seen the movie mad Max fury road? Pretty much every day of my life is like that. It's the only way I can explain it.
Why is Karen Gillan even in this movie she’s just another indiscriminate blue person with weird contacts looking angry in tight pants
Watching Kung Fury with my big, seen this movie 4 times and it's still just as good each time.

Good enough to watch for free RT @Lixen123: Has anyone seen the movie Fury? If so, is it good, bad or pass?
30 seconds into watching the movie Kung Fury and this might be the best movie I've ever seen.
I cry every time I watch some war movie like fury or American sniper etc
Becoming more and more convinced that Mad Max: Fury Road is really just a movie about Las Vegas in 15 years.

Watched "Mad Max: Fury Road" again this morning. Such a cool movie.
@Superherologist My kids would be thinking, "What is Nick Fury doing in a Star Wars movie?"
@stirpicus I was typing "no eric" but then envisioned a movie where Vin Diesel plays a superhero called "The Sound" & the Rock is "The Fury"
'Fury' was one good movie. Two hours well spent :)
The first 20 minutes of Mad Max:Fury Road are the best action movie if the past ten years. And then it keeps going. And becoming better. Yhu
You know what movie I wanna rewatch right now? Fury Road.

You would never knw the severity of the fury of a woman scorned until you watch #GoneGirl and you actually let the mssg of the movie sink in

Fury Road is such a great movie
I really like this movie, #Fury

After another disappointment, looking in TiVo for movie. It suggests "The Sound & The Fury." How'd they make a movie outta that?!
@xhefs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the only movie I give a 10. Punch Drunk Love, We Were Soldiers, Fury are some more.

If it wasn't for a few somewhat confusing action scenes, Mad Max Fury Road would've been a perfect movie in my opinion. Incredibly good!
So happy that my essay is supposed to be about Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan, and a war movie of our choice... which I'm choosing Fury

Just watched a movie called 'Fury' starring Brad Pitt....fantastic movie..a great movie after a long time & better than Bihar elections
Fury is a classy movie but when majority of the scenes are edited it doesn't make sense. The problem with Indian TV. #FuryOnMoviesNow

@reichenby It's like you're writing the sequel to Kung Fury, or maybe the next Lego Movie.
Watching Fury.. One hell of a war movie #FuryOnMoviesNow #moviesNow
Just watched Mad Max: Fury Road. That has to be the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen
Let's talk seeing MAD MAX: FURY ROAD again in 35 and what joy it is to see it knowing I'm about to make my own action movie
Upon a second viewing, I can confirm that FURY ROAD is a perfect movie.
Amazing fun here with fury movie waiting for the amazing movie on most amazing channel @moviesnowtv #FuryOnMoviesNow

FURY is a phenomenal movie
"Fury" is on my laptop for days.. so seems it's a great movie..let me enjoy now #FuryOnMoviesNow
Funny to me how many think pieces were written about Fury Road. It's really just a dumb loud action movie. A very well done one, but still.
@laserunicorns just watched Kung Fury, what a great movie. I can't wait to see more adventures
