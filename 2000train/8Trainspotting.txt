I'll just watch a nice, relaxing movie before bed. Like Trainspotting.
Ewan mcgregor's too damn pretty shooting dope for all the ceiling babies in the world to really make trainspotting an anti drug movie
Trainspotting has the best opening monologue of any movie

@AyyYuraayy Frank, Frances ha, Slacker (my favorite), Trainspotting, Fat kid rules the world (good music), God Bless America (crazy movie)
#Trainspotting is said 2 be a good movie but I couldn't understand anything from the trailer.It's as confusing as that movie, #PansLabyrinth
trainspotting actually made me want to do heroin that movie failed
Reading Trainspotting is not fun. I can barely read it and unlike the movie the point of view jumps from person to person and it's confusing
@StoneSchossow How many times have you seen BB all the way through? And Trainspotting is a badass movie on Netflix.

Watching Trainspotting at a bar and recalling my first movie star crush was Ewan McGregor playing a heroin addict and feeling shame arousal
Trainspotting cast at Kings Head as good as in the movie so future star spot and enjoy the language, the drugs and the sex. See Reviewsgate
Trainspotting at the Kings Head until 11 April. Forget the movie, this is an in your face drug taking feast of four letter words to enjoy.

Read about what went into the iconic "Trainspotting" movie poster http://creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2011/march/trainspotting-film-poster-campaign-15-years-on …
Is Trainspotting a good movie? I see it mentioned with other movies that I enjoyed.
The closest thing to a realistic heroin movie is probably Requiem, but Trainspotting is still the best of the genre.

Trainspotting is the best movie ever
I'm still haunted after watching #Trainspotting last week. Powerful movie.
Trainspotting is movie abt heroine addiction.It differentiates d lives of d one who beat d addiction & d one who is still addicted.
Everything I know about Scottish independence comes from the movie Trainspotting. http://youtu.be/Ci82yWg-9Q0?t=52s …
#Nowplaying "Born Slippy NUXX" by Underworld on tonight's Film & TV-themed "In The Moog Show" on @NCCRradio From the movie "Trainspotting"
If Scotland goes independent, I look forward to a Trainspotting: Special Edition awash in CGI, retrofitting the movie with plenty of jawas.
i blame all this Scottish bullshit on that movie Trainspotting... Renton, you bastard!!!!!!!
Trainspotting has to be the best movie soundtrack CD of all time. (Next to Saturday Night Fever, of course)

Trainspotting is my second favorite movie.
@NathalieBby we gotta have a movie night w/ trainspotting lol
Addendum to the Ewan McGregor Obi-Wan so movie tweet: not if it fucks up the Trainspotting sequel. That is more important.
watching trainspotting after reading the book was hard cause I feel like welsh would hate how renton was portrayed in the movie
No, I am patronizing the half who seem intent on choosing socialist failure. Trainspotting should be movie, not a country. @vonny_bravo
Tried to watch trainspotting just got to the part where the dude is digging through his own shit in the toilet and I'm done with this movie
Watched the movie Filth tonight. It's a giant barrel of WTF with a dash of LOL. Mulholland Drive and Trainspotting made a baby.
There's gonna be a trainspotting 2 movie made! Can't actually wait! What a classic!
Random thought, if Scotland became independant would Trainspotting be claimed as their most succesful movie?
Trainspotting will forever be my fave movie
@SparkyROAR UGGSPOTTING, a sequel to the movie Trainspotting.

"Trainspotting" is one of the very few book isn't definitely better than the movies, but I sure wish the movie was an hour longer.
Trainspotting was a weirdly important movie to me as a kid. I kinda hope Scotland secedes. Guess Ewan's voting "No": http://youtu.be/G1tJJO_pVvQ 
Trainspotting is my favourite movie in World Cinema #topical #humour
From movie Trainspotting, about the English and Scots: They're (English) just wankers. We, on the other hand, are COLONIZED by wankers.

Booked tickets for a weekend trip to Scotland today, so now of course I'm rewatching Trainspotting to commemorate. Still the best movie.
@EyeQFilms trainspotting started as a drugs movie and ended as a heist film. Slumdog was a mix of bollywood & Dickinson That's his thing :D
I would tweet a clip of the movie but all the best bits aka Choose Life, I Don't Hate The English are all NSFW! #Trainspotting
Trainspotting is one of my favorite movie/book combos ever. Both are amazing in their own respects
@duhhcotah but he's in trainspotting and it is a good movie
Halfway through the movie Trainspotting and I seriously need subtitles. Crazy Scots.
It's weird how Trainspotting, a movie about heroin addiction, can bring me so much joy.
Trainspotting is also a great movie.
Trainspotting is fantastically messed up movie. Black comedy at it's finest.
@I_Take_E_123 @rachelbkiss @StephaniesBrain You've seen Trainspotting haven't you? Movie quote comp on the radio. I chose wild & wacky route
It used to be 500 DOS/Trainspotting but BITWC is the only movie that can successfully make me cry.
Watched "Filth" last night, easily the best Scottish movie since Trainspotting
Trainspotting is an interesting movie
