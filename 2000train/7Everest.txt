#Everest is about climbers trying to get to the top of it. You think people live in this one? It's a boring movie about icy suicide.
"everest" movie was...... wow im so speechless
I honestly felt like I was in the movie Everest as I was walking to class this morning.
Everest movie made me cry. But the most important thing is, it's a real story. The real people, the real lives.

'Everest' isn't leaving my mind. Such a strong, emotional movie. #Everestmovie
The moral of the movie Everest is don't fucking climb Mount Everest
The trailer for #Everest is more exciting than the movie. The movie is more a dedication to a heartbreaking true tale of tragic lives lost.

Finally thinking of going to watch the new 'Everest' movie. Don't be surprised if the cinema roof falls down on me...
Everest movie really breaks my heart. Based on a true story on 1996, eight people caught in a blizzard died on Mount Everest.
The movie Everest has such a depressing ending
Watching the movie "Everest" and no fricken way would I try and climb it. Not with 1 in 4 climbers dying. I'd be 4 of 4 for sure

I'm thinking of seeing a movie tonight, but not sure which out of three choices: Everest, The Walk, or Sicario. Any opinions out there?

I was expecting more Craig Doyle in the #Everest movie mind. I guess his role was cut. Those climbers could have used triple-glazed windows.
Make sure you catch #Everest in cinemas. It's the feel good movie of the year! Cast are outstanding! Kiwi Keira Knightley is a dream.
one thing i got out from the everest movie? im never going mountain climbing

Am I the only one who thinks that Everest is a bad movie?
The Everest movie is 2.30 hours long, so that means it takes 2.30 hours to climb my Everest.
Everest was basically a movie where you watch people slowly die over two hours. Good movie nonetheless. 2.8/5
