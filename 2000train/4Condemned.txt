@Inside_TheRopes Watching Condemned 2. Really good movie. Orton is better than I figured he'd be.
But on a serious note it's sad they didn't get the message of the movie. Our minds can set us free, even if our bodies are condemned!
Watching the Condemned 2 @RandyOrton I hope this means more acting! U are amazing in this movie!!!
This game reminds me of the 2007 movie 'The Condemned' with Steve Austin. Both of which are fucking brilliant.

Just got done watching The Condemned 2 great job @RandyOrton it was a great movie LOVED IT!! :) :) :) :) :)
Condemned 2 wasn't too bad of a movie.
I see there is another Chipmunks movie. What horrible secret is Jason Lee hiding that led him to being condemned to this franchise? So odd.
@AMCHelps AMC 30 - Off Dunvale in #HosutonTX. Not only should the facilities be condemned, miserable movie watching experience. Never again.

@Matmenpodcast if Randy Orton doesn't RKO anyone in Condemned 2, the movie will be a disappointment. In fact, it should be his only weapon
There's a punch in that Condemned 2 trailer that misses by at least a foot. Truly a wrestling movie. #HIAC
That condemned movie would be way more realistic if Orton went AWOL, harassed women, then kept getting hurt. #WWEHIAC
THEY ARE SHOWING A TRAILER FOR THE CONDEMNED 2 I MUST SEE THAT MOVIE
FUN FACTS: The first Condemned movie wasn't just bad, it was actively repulsive. I felt like I needed a shower when it ended. #HIAC
