I've seen "Chairman of the Board" & "Batman & Robin," so I know it's not *the* worst movie ever, but even by Affleck standards, it's awful.

@FrancisManapul chairman of the board was a HILARIOUS movie! Tell me you saw it & loved it!
@SklarBrothers You gotta pick up Carrot Top's 1998 movie "Chairman of the Board." You'll laugh at how bad it is; Watch trailer on Youtube.
@SklarBrothers You need to see his movie from 1998 entitled "Chairman of the Board." It also starred Courtney Thorne-Smith from Melros.
7am board meetings are less fun than advertised. Anyone own the movie chairman of the board with the kid surfing on the cover?
And i'd like everyone to know "Chairman of the Board" is quite possibly the most progressive Carrot Top movie of the mid-nineties

@ClintRutkas Favorite Norm line on Conan: guest Carrot Top promoting his awful "Chairman of the Board" movie. Norm: Is that B O R E D ?
thinks that if there's ever a WHEELMAN movie, Chairman of the Board's "Pay To The Piper" needs to play over the end credits.
