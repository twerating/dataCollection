"The titanic wasn't real right?? It's just made up for this movie right?" - @bbiaancasaintt
Did you realize about THIS when you watch Titanic? It’s unbelievable! http://disneywords.me/r/3IonA 
@Glam_And_Gore Ripley not giving you kisses is sader than titanic or any other sad movie I/you can think of.
when you thought titanic was a sad movie until you figured out they didn't let black people on the ship
remember when jinyoung said he keeps watching titanic lately? look at how the movie's coming to his own life pic.twitter.com/T1f9ORCzvy
Titanic was the first movie to win a Best Picture Oscar that was produced, directed, written and edited by the same person, James Cameron.
The filming of the movie 'Titanic' cost more than it cost to build the Titanic.
movie idea: Bella (as a mortal) on the Titanic with Edward and his only hope for her living is changing her into a vampire. Twitanic.

Titanic was only a movie. No way could people be so stupid as to build a ship without the required number of lifeboats. #FakeResearchFacts
Titanic was the first movie to make more than $1 billion. Avatar was the second.
Besides the fact that they are longer than the movie titanic. I like trying old/new things pic.twitter.com/j7cP9Va90R
The original founders/owners of Macy’s died on the Titanic and were the old couple in the movie who went to sleep as the ship went down.
With the total grossing money James Cameron's Titanic movie made, about 5 real life Titanics could've been built instead
"If the titanic came on while I was running, I would run for the entire movie"
This movie (Avatar) is so very freakin' great. That's why it rank #1 best movie in the world 2nd the Titanic #OTWOLReal
Will Jurassic World (2015) pass Titanic (1997) to become the #2 all-time highest-grossing movie domestically by the end of the year?
"I thought titanic was just a movie" - @ginna_leaphart

#IMayBeAloneOnThis But I *HATE* Romeo and Juliet and any movie/story that rip off the premise. (i.e. Titanic, West Side Story, etc.)
Why do so many women like 'Titanic'? The main theme is lovely, but one song a movie does not make.

Watching the Titanic this is a brutal movie when you really think about it.
Watching #Titanic for the first time from start to finish and I see why this movie is the greatest of all time.
Titanic was everywhere when it came out, like on t-shirts and watches and plates. I avoided the movie even more because of it.
Titanic the movie has been around for almost 20 years and I still haven't watched it.
The titanic movie gets me every time I watch it

I have never seen the movie Titanic. (Nor do I have the desire to.)
I have a hard time not blurting out that my fave song is "My Heart Will Go On" and my fave movie is "Titanic." Teen yrs were impressionable!
so the movie titanic was a recreation but the actors still died and they sunk a ship wtf whats the point??
@Heis49 well because the titanic you're talking about is a movie, it was not filmed as the actual thing was happening. They recreated it.

@heswifi I Want to Write You a Song: Heartfelt. Sounds like a track from the Titanic movie.
I watch #Titanic again and still, I feel emotional every time I watch it. :'( Best movie of all time! #IWillNeverLetGo — watching Titanic
The making of the movie Titanic, at $200 million, cost more than the ship itself.
People should freeze The Wolf of Wall Street as a favorite movie on http://FreezeCrowd.com . People still freeze Titanic w/ @LeoDiCaprio
If I had to watch one movie over and over again, it would definitely be... Titanic #MoviesOnLoop

Thinking about the Titanic movie makes me remember why I wat watched it 7 times one summer... Great story
did you know the movie Titanic was all improv. no script they all just went for it.
This, much like the movie Titanic, is a really entertaining film that you know how it ends.
Nana, having lost a lot of her knowledge due to dementia, thinks the sinking of Titanic was just a movie. I had to explain it to her. Sad.
still the best movie for me @/titanic
Spotify Movie scores + Assassin's Creed Black Flag.. Theme from Titanic goes really well with an angry Blackbeard.
Thank god the titanic wasn't real that movie was intense could u imagine the tragedy if it actually happened ?

That's why the Titanic doesn't sink until the end of the movie. If it sank in the first scene you'd have nothing to watch for.

When someone on here said "when you thought Titanic was a sad movie then remembered blacks weren't allowed on the boat"
If I was in the movie Titanic, Climax could be different. I swims across the Atlantic Ocean with Kate in one hand and Titanic in the other.
Also, Jurassic World is the third biggest movie of all time. It needed like maybe....8 million more dollars domestically to know Titanic off
In the movie "Titanic," Jack and Rose both could have stayed on the wooden beam without it sinking.

Titanic was released 85 years after the event & was a loved movie. I wonder if in 2096 it would be acceptable to make a love story of 9/11.

The original founders/owners of Macy’s died on the Titanic and were the old couple in the movie who went to sleep as the ship went down.

If the names Jack and Rose are omitted from the movie's dialogue, Titanic becomes the longest and most successful silent film.
