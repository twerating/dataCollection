The kid and I were reminiscing about DOOGAL, a 2006 animated atrocity that is the worst movie we've ever seen. What's your all-time worst?
@theCynch personally I reckon the dead birds thing is a massive project to promote a unannounced Angry Birds Movie.. It's a theory
Doogal is such an intense movie..
@RavenWorks The French version of the "Doogal" movie - "Pollux et Le Manege Enchante"

"Up" score +1 movie geekness #apprentice
Doogal, Labrynth, a 'you' movie, 'it'll fall off', banana puke, late night burgers, coppery aftertaste, hot naughty nuns, cream in the ear
@KristieBeth506 that's so funny. My niece is 7 & while watching a movie, a preview 4 doogal came on. she knew jimmy was in it by his voice
So then, how long until they make a movie about the trapped miners?
Ok, so Ive determined that Doogal has the most movie references EVER!!

Love how itunes has imported cover of The Doogal Movie for soundtrack of Control - 2 v different films with very different music I imagine
@Live_for_Films It still upsets me that The Magic Roundabout movie was adapted in the US into the God-damned-awful Doogal movie.
Just got done watching Doogal. Thought it would be a cute cartoony movie. It is way kiddish! Good thing my nephews will probably like it.
I know I've said this before, but WHAT THE FUCK is up with Doogal? This is possibly the worst movie ever.
the us movie "doogal" (2006) is not worth bothering with, see the uk original called "the magical roundabout" instead.
Just watched some really gay kids movie at the Origins sponsored kids day, it was terribly painful... Doogal was the name of it, no
