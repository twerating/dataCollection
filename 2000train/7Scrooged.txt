@kurtisnorman_ My favorite Christmas movie is Scrooged (1988) with Bill Murray.
@Danielleri Scrooged! And I still watch A Nightmare Before Christmas even though I think, technically, it's more of a Halloween movie
@maylee9 scrooged. It's so bloody funny #Bitchhitmewithatoaster is the best line in any Christmas movie...ever lol

I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/5FgtVXFRyTQ?a  Scrooged (6/10) Movie CLIP - Five Pounds of Veal (1988) HD
@PMPRacing7 I also love the Bill Murray movie Scrooged.
ALL JOKING (AND OPINIONS OF FILM CRITICS) ASIDE, scrooged is (AND ALWAYS WILL BE) my favourite xmas movie
The Ghost of Christmas Past in #Scrooged is really frightening. Also it feels weird to watch a "Christmas" movie in November.
Home Alone isn't my fav Christmas movie. It just gets me in the spirit. Christmas Vacation, Scrooged and the Look Who's Talking w the dogs.

@stevesignore a non-holiday movie. I also love Billl Murray in SCROOGED.
@mocfilms scrooged is the best - love that movie
@fbhw A Christmas Story, Scrooged and Santa Clause the movie.
First random Christmas movie on TV I saw this year was Scrooged. I take that as a sign of good fortune.
Watched the first Christmas movie tonight: Scrooged with BFM of course. One of my favourites.
You know, Scrooged isn't a great movie, but it becomes pretty fascinating once you read about Michael O'Donoghue's opinion of his NBC execs.
Trapped watching #scrooged until the walking dead starts. I can stop watching that pos now. It is a terrible, terrible, Xmas movie.
#scrooged is a terrible Christmas movie. I don't think Bill Murray was even trying at that point of his career.
The first Christmas movie of the year is Scrooged, thanks CBC, and PVR.
The only Christmas movie I will watch is on -> Scrooged
Surprised that it's taken me 27 years to finally see Bill Murray's Scrooged. Not the best Christmas movie I've ever seen, but still not bad.
Scrooged is on. Is this the best Christmas movie ever?
Too early for #christmas thingnies.. But still will watch #scrooged just 'cause I love that movie and… https://instagram.com/p/-sNKk_EkH2/

My kids have gotten 2 the point that if they see a #TimBurton or #DannyElfman movie, they check the credits 4 @VeNeill too. #Scrooged=no :-(
@NetworkISA It's a Wonderful Life (for tradional style) Scrooged is my favorite (Dickens style) holiday movie, & A Christmas Story is 3rd.
@JayCaruso @SonnyBunch is Scrooged on your list? Or am I the only one who thinks that movie is genius?
@TheFive Bill Murray was excellent in 1988 Christmas movie Scrooged. :o) Happy Thanksgiving.

That movie was funny for all the wrong reasons. Bill Murray can't act, he can't do serious, he can only be sarcastic. #Scrooged #Film4

Movie *1552 - "Scrooged (1988)". Bill Murray really cracked me up during this film! He's such a unique actor tht you gotta love him. Rate 7.
Best holiday movie... GO! A) It's a Wonderful Life B) The Grinch C) Christmas Vacation D) Elf F) Miracle on 34th St. G) Scrooged

@lisaling What an interesting yet basely human topic. Glued to TV. Does this make me macabre? Crematorium was like scene in movie Scrooged.
I'll tell you @Loofighter, if they remake the movie Scrooged and cast Josh Harris ... this would be the opening scene.
Scrooged is an underrated holiday movie
"Dr. Carson, how would you improve our economy?" "Well, I love the movie Home Alone. The sequel? Not so much. Scrooged is also great!"
Bill Murray can do no wrong. Between this and 'Scrooged', he will be a mainstay of my Christmas movie binges. https://twitter.com/PasteMagazine/status/663803690738814977 …

@ravenmews meh. It's alright ;) Scrooged is my "go-to" x-mas movie. But, as Meatloaf once said: "Two out of three ain't bad."
you guys. I'm not saying the Starbucks cups are right or wrong. I'm just saying, "Scrooged" is maybe the best holiday movie ever.

@normwilner @jessehawken Murray is quoted as claiming Scrooged wasn't as good as the script, too. 100% certain Donner saved that movie

'Die Hard' IS a great film, but I think my favourite Christmas movie is 'Scrooged'. This information is brought to you by No Reason At All.
@repqnz @Funionz I respectfully disagree. Scrooged might be a top 5 Christmas movie
NO, COCA-COLA. ONLY THE MOVIE "SCROOGED" CAN USE JACKIE DE SHANNON'S 'PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN YOUR HEART' TO FURTHER WORLD PEACE.

Scrooged is like having a movie with Peter Venkman, Marion Ravenwood and Zed from Police Academy.

Not wrestling related, but what other Christmas movie would you like to see on tv for 24 hours? My vote is Santa Claus or Scrooged.

If "Scrooged" didn't exist, I'm pretty sure "Mixed Nuts" would be the best Christmas movie.
Scrooged is a rare perfect movie. #christmas
@RAvsgirl @Avalanche I'm going to change yours up just a bit: Blues Get Scrooged! #AvsHeader Or just Scrooged! (Not the @BiIIMurray movie).
Family Christmas movie tradition started out tonight with Scrooged and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. About ten more to go.......
The ending of this movie only works because of Bill Murray's charm. It would be so lame & annoying in lesser hands. #Scrooged @HorrorHoneys
Posited: SCROOGED is the Bill Murray-est Bill Murray movie.

Monday was Charlie Brown Christmas & Scrooged #xmastv&movie
I'm watching my favorite Christmas movie "Scrooged" starring Bill Murray and @bcgoldthwait ! I love this film :)
(SCROOGED isn’t my favorite Bill Murray movie, but I think it has one of his best performances. He makes it something more.)
Watched SCROOGED with the gf last night; it went over well. We both agree it’s a messy movie, but Bill Murray is amazing.
@CTVReginaLive My Favorite Xmas Movies are: Scrooged, Christmas Vacation, Die Hard. Yes Die Hard is a Xmas Movie!!

That Bill Murray "Scrooged" movie really falls apart the last ten to fifteen minutes, ya know?
"Mr. Higgins what movie are we watching tomorrow?" "Scrooged."
'Scrooged' is the best Christmas movie because I forget that it's my favorite every year.
Figure I should finally get around to watching #Scrooged before my "movie fan" card gets revoked.
Hey TV channels, more of you need to show Scrooged in your Christmas movie mix.

I was thinking that Scrooged sounded like a Tim Burton movie and then see the credit for Score by Danny Elfman at the end, makes sense.
@Xantiriad err... To my shame I've just watched Scrooged for the first time. It's absolutely incredible. What a movie :-)
The best Xmas movie ever is Scrooged, but only closely followed by Gremlins.
My top 5 Xmas movie picks: Better Off Dead, Die Hard, Love Actually, Elf, Scrooged.
@josejonesfilms The Elfman music in Scrooged made me think a Tim Burton movie like batman Returns or Edward Scissorhands for #rtscreenplay

#Scrooged is a great Christmas movie. I'm not ashamed to admit I broke out into a full 80s dance routine during the end credits.
Holiday movie of the night: Scrooged
Carol Kane and David Johansen of the New York Dolls as the ghosts in "Scrooged" are one of my favorite parts of the Christmas movie lineup.
Favorite X-Mas movie? Doesn't have to be overtly X-Mas. Can even be just set during X-Mas time. Mines is a toss up. Scrooged & Die Hard.

I forgot how much I love the movie Scrooged
The only good christmas movie on netflix is scrooged
Joel Murray is also in it as a party guest. So the movie has all 4 of the Murray brothers that are actors. #Scrooged
Sounds like @BBCRadio4' Saturday Play is the radio version of the version of A Christmas Carol they were putting on in the movie "Scrooged"
I woke up and decided to watch a Christmas movie... selected "Scrooged" - this is one hell of an opening. I have no idea what's happening.
My xmas movie Lineup every year: Scrooged, Xmas Vacation, Friday afta Next, Bad Santa, Elf, Xmas Story, Jim carreys The Grinch.
Scrooged (1988): All of Bill Murray’s actor brothers are in the movie – that would be Brian Doyle-Murray, Joel Murray and John Murray.
My favourite Christmas movie is It's a Wonderful Life, but I respect those who prefer Die Hard or Scrooged. No other answers are valid!
@mirry_mirry I can't argue with that - incredible film. I'd also add Santa Claus The Movie (the first half of it anyway) & Scrooged.
@SundayHamster I'm watching a funny X-mas movie called "Scrooged" with Bill Murry it was made in 1988! It's very funny

Every Christmas I watch #Scrooged I get #nostalgic. Not only b/c of the X-Mas movie but also because I loved #MaryLouRetton
Sitn here watchn #Scrooged. This movie really makes u think....
Why couldn't "The Night the Reindeer Died" w/ Lee Majors have been a real Christmas movie instead of a fake 1 in "Scrooged!" #FallGuyRules
Watching #Scrooged. Carol Kane (Ghost of Christmas Present) is the best part of the movie. LMFAO Loved this movie when I was younger.

Scrooged is the kind of awful movie that you feel you need a shower after watching it to wash yourself clean of it.

Best Christmas movie is 'Scrooged' with Bill Murray. This is my final decision. pic.twitter.com/8ZtIDmryDJ
Tune in late for CYS and it's Scrooged. A movie people claim is great but like most 80s comedies is just horribly dated in how ugly it is.

My favorite Christmas movie is Scrooged, if that tells you anything about me....
Maaan, I forgot how freaking WEIRD a movie Scrooged is. Like. "What did we just watch?" levels of weird.

For some reason the Putin video reminded me of the Bill Murray produced Holiday Show ad in the movie Scrooged. #tytlive
Came home and the kids were watching Scrooged with BiII Murray on Netflix. Not the best Christmas movie for a 4YO...
Aside from Scrooged, Netflix's best Xmas movie is Ernest Saves Christmas. These are nobody's "Holiday Favorites."
Scrooged. " @jimjefferies: Ok whats the greatest Christmas movie ever?"
When I see the threats made about "the interview" movie I think of the movie "Scrooged" "You can't buy publicity like this!!!!"
the best xmas movie of all time is and always will be scrooged.
Time for a Christmas movie... may as well start with the best #Scrooged
my principled stance that Scrooged is a top 10 xmas movie doesn't exclude physical violence against those who disagree
Just had a Christmas movie convo. The other person didn't know the movie Scrooged. All his opinions on Christmas movies now are meaningless
Can't believe I finally agree with @GreatDonovan BAD SANTA is the best Xmas movie ever. And SCROOGED is genius. @gordonkeith @junior_miller

@Jody_Houser Scrooged is probably my favorite Christmas Carol movie. I even like it better than the Muppet one.
Last Movie Nite of the year was Scrooged (which I'd never seen), mulled wine, and the best popcorn ever.
Movie night next Friday: We will screen “Scrooged” & talk about different U.S. and Korean Christmas traditions. RSVP: http://goo.gl/YIQmgY

Scrooged is probably the best #Christmas movie of any sub-genre. It has a leg up merely by having Bill Murray in it.

I tell people my favourite Xmas movie is "It's a Wonderful Life". Y'know, so I sound classy. But it's really "Scrooged". Cause #billmurray
If you watch the movie Scrooged backwards, it's about three ghosts haunting a generous guy until he becomes a selfish recluse.
Scrooged staring Bill Murray is this week's movie of the week. Rent for 99 cents. #iTunes https://itun.es/ca/RnHms  pic.twitter.com/M0whOVIiCT

#Scrooged is a perfect movie. #Christmas
Scrooged has all the elements of a badass movie: Bill Murray, pre-Giuliani New York, and an 80's interpretation of futuristic tech.
I think what I love the most is there's no religious undertones in this movie but just about kindness and love. Great watch. #SCROOGED

Ok i've watched the amazing @IamSantaMovie starring the amazing @realmickfoley now for another great holiday movie scrooged
Christmas Movie Recommendation Day 6- Scrooged. This hilarious and crazy take on a Christmas Carol is not to be missed. Bill Murray!
Just watched Scrooged for the 9 billionth time. That movie never gets old
Bill Murray might be a comedic genius, but "Scrooged" is a terrible movie.
Scrooged is by far my favorite Christmas movie.. Bill Murray at his best, and it's so true to the entertainment industry.
Greatest Bill Murray Christmas movie of all time, Scrooged, is on Netflix. Watch it or you'll regret it later.

That's the second time I've seen Scrooged and I gotta say I just can't stand it. Not sure why really. But not even Bill Murray saves it :/
December: the one month a year when Ghostbusters isn't my favourite Bill Murray movie. (It's Scrooged)
Home Alone and Muppets Christmas Carol done :) Die Hard, Elf, Gremlins and Scrooged left :) #XmasPyjamaParty @ThePCCLondon
Scrooged is certainly an interesting movie.
#scrooged such a good movie! Love #BillMurrary
Watching SCROOGED. I don't understand why people like this movie.
Movie night tonight. Scrooged? I think so
Scrooged. Has there ever been a more perfect movie made? No. No there has not. Shut up, you’re wrong.

Why does everyone love the film Elf so much? It's not even the 3rd best Xmas movie. It goes Scrooged, Die Hard, Muppets Xmas Carol....
Why is Bernard and the Genie not on any channel or Netflix. It's the best Christmas movie. Settling on the second best, Scrooged.
Man I hope some exec got Scrooged, because that Peter Pan thing was like the movie Scrooged. Except not tits or stapled deer mice.

Why are there so many raspberries in the movie Scrooged? Christmas Ghosts should keep their lips to themselves.
Just watched Scrooged for the first time. Great movie. Love the life that you have.
@mattzollerseitz Am I the only one who thought this looked like a joke TV special from a comedy movie, like the crazy Scrooge from SCROOGED?
My wife adores Scrooged and I think it's actually a bad movie. I love Bill Murray, but not that much. Oh well, couples counselling it is!

Bill Murray might be able to sue NBC for stealing his character’s Christmas production in the movie Scrooged. #PeterPan #MoreCleavage
I picture the holiday production of NBC's #PeterPanLive was a lot like the movie Scrooged.

Approaching that time of year where I ferociously argue that "Scrooged" is the best Christmas movie ever made
Final Thoughts on Scrooged: This is a weird ass movie that I just realized is directed by Richard Donner.

Actually can be any movie that Elfman wrote a score for. But I hope its scrooged!
*Hearing movie intro music from another room* not sure if Scrooged or Batman Returns
Best Christmas movie ever?!?!?!?!? Scrooged, followed by It's A Wonderful Life and Christmas Vacation #Christmas
Watching Scrooged, I feel Charlie Day's whole acting style is based on Bobcat Goldthwait in this movie.
Christmas Carol could almost be a horror on its own, but Scrooged really pushes that story over the line ._. I forgot how this movie can be.
Love the song at the end of the #Scrooged movie "Put a little love in your heart" that's going on my Christmas playlist
They should adapt the movie Scrooged into a stage-play.
@pauljeremiah Ah that's brilliant.It really is a wonderful life!Was looking on n'flix 4 movie y'day. Wanted Oliver! Settled 4 Scrooged#
Christmas Movie advent begins tonight in the Back Room Cinema, drum roll please... SCROOGED staring Bill Murray, 8.30 pic.twitter.com/QRc4UzBt68
that scrooged movie was garbage, you liars.
Made it to Dec. 1st. The year has gone by quickly. That being said, the best Holiday movie, ever, is Scrooged. That is all.
I forgot how much I love the movie Scrooged.
Classic RT @Radioblitz: Scrooged with Bill Murray is my fav Christmas movie
Watching Scrooged on @netflix. Best #Christmas movie ever (well, at least Top 5).
Love it! Who's going? RT @discoverLA: Enjoy a classic seasonal movie, "Scrooged," @ElectricDuskLA drive-in: http://bit.ly/11UBEgS 
Girlfriend wanted to watch a Christmas movie, but I got to pick... Scrooged it is
Official Christmas movie watching begins with the classic, Scrooged starring Bill Murray and Karen Allen. #Eighties #xmasmovies #fb
My favorite Xmas movie is Scrooged. The scene when @bcgoldthwait is drunk trying to kill Bill Murray with a shotgun is priceless. Woof Woof
What's your favorite Christmas movie? I have many loves, but Scrooged and Christmas Vacation are my favorites.
Just been reminded of It's a Wonderful Life by @Fulhamyob. Of course! Ok that wins #1 xmas movie. Scrooged 2nd. Elf 3rd. #FeelingFestive
@PhilWilliams .... can I throw Bill Murray in SCROOGED into the Xmas movie mix? A great overlooked film!
Just watched Scrooged. Classic movie.
Damn! Just missed Scrooged. Love that movie. Oh, well I'll just watch it on DVD before Christmas.

@maura are you watching Scrooged right now? If so, call out the one Bill Murray ad lib that needlessly dates the movie when u see it
@mikethefilmguy Scrooged is strictly reserved for Christmas Eve for me. It's my stocking stuffing movie. @DrewAtHitFix
“ @TheYoungTurks: What's your favorite #Christmas movie?” Scrooged or Christmas Vacation

Sometimes you see a movie a zillion times and not notice a hilarious bit. "Father Loves Beaver". #scrooged
Watching Scrooged. Such a great fucking movie. "Great thing about treating people bad on the way up is treating them bad on the way down"
Need a break from the holiday madness? Enjoy a classic seasonal movie, "Scrooged," @ElectricDuskLA drive-in: http://bit.ly/11UBEgS 
Loved 'home alone'. Next up - 'Scrooged'. Another Christmas movie I really can't remember.
Scrooged is the most underrated Christmas movie ever.
I never get tired of the fake Lee Majors action movie trailer at the beginning of Scrooged.
The Santa Clause 2 is my second favourite Christmas Movie after Scrooged !! the Robot Santa is brilliant !
It's never too early X Scrooged! The Movie - Put a Little Love in your Heart - End Scene http://youtu.be/YVvkj7jL-RM

Best holiday movie of all time? My vote: SCROOGED, starring the incomparable Bill Murray as Frank… http://instagram.com/p/v-VE3RvWVu/ 
Had to start out the Christmas season with the movie "Scrooged" #BillMurray #TheLegend
Alright, first Christmas movie of the season for me: Scrooged!
One thing I don't like in a movie is when a sweet person becomes the villain ;n; Like in the newest Spider-Man, and kinda in Scrooged too...
First Christmas movie of the year with @_megaloDOM_ #wastenotime #scrooged #billmurray #legend #inhisprime #wildfridays #hashtag

Scrooged is literally my favorite christmas movie #stopwiththeGODDAMNhammering
Scrooged still an all time festive movie @Film4
I think the funniest movie where a man is cremated alive while he begs his brother not to let them burn him is probably Scrooged.
Rewatching #Scrooged (1988) @film4 - the ULTIMATE Christmas movie!
Post dinner movie. Time to get in the holiday spirit. #scrooged #billmurray http://instagram.com/p/v64vlbDCyF/

Scrooged is a really good movie!
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/3kX6rf9uw7w?a  A Christmas Miracle - Scrooged (10/10) Movie CLIP (1988) HD
Promos for NBC's Peter Pan Live remind me of the live production of A Christmas Carol in the movie Scrooged. Which was awesome. #yuleloveit
Ok, all of these #NBC holiday commercials seem like they were taken from the movie #scrooged. #IBC #yuleloveit

Geez, I have heard more versions of Ebola , than there are endings in the movie Scrooged. The only real fact I see is that it kills people.
Bill Murray wants to sing Christmas Carols. Didn't he do that in the movie Scrooged -Put a Little Love in your Heart http://youtu.be/YVvkj7jL-RM 
Obviously need to pace that so I get to Scrooged at Christmas. Top 10 Christmas movie that.
scrooged is my favorite christmas movie

“ @NCAACOMPLIANCE: on Xmas in July night - must be Xavier Francis Cross from the movie "Scrooged"” I was afraid of being hit with a toaster.
We used to get in for free tho. He would just wear the jacket he got from the movie's wrap party. The first time was for the movie Scrooged.
#aFantasticFearOfEverything - a really nice movie featuring a lovely #SimonPegg ...scrooged
So the movie Scrooged never gets old

I love the movie Scrooged, but the lady from Taxi aka the ghost of Christmas present really gets on my nerves
What about Bob? may be the funniest Bill Murray movie ever. Though Groundhog Day/Scrooged are a close second. Comedic perfection. #fb
A movie that was like Scrooged but about a web troll who has ghosts showing him all the people he'd messed with over time
it is the best movie of all time. I say that a lot but really scrooged is it for me. Idk. It's not like a regular christmas carol
