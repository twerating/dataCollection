I've never watched a Star Wars movie all the way through.
@StephenAtHome The entire movie is one long pod-race #spoilerspoilers

Today's movie recommendation: POD. Written & directed by Mickey Keating. #DionysusSays pic.twitter.com/WvNWXupGc3
@TonyTodd54 @NowPlayingPod is a top notch movie review pod. I also listen to @ThatKevinSmith pods. He's a big fan of your Zoom btw ;)
Even though the rest of the movie may not be that good, the pod race in Episode I is still one of the most exciting parts of the series. IMO

Pod is a raad horror movie. Also fun: surprise Larry Fessenden! pic.twitter.com/6rlrj72Igj
Oh so everyone in this movie is that kind of pretty. #Pod pic.twitter.com/OA1iBWwY8c
Honestly, this movie has some pretty great moments in it. For a B horror, anyway. #Pod
Looking for something fun on the old Netflix? Check out @POD_Movie. Fun ride @mickeykeating
You told me this movie would be about intergalactic tax laws and instead it's an endless pod race and I don't know if I'm mad or not?
If anyone wants to explain the movie I just watched, feel free. #Pod.

Just discovered @GoodfellasMin, a pod that dissects one minute of Goodfellas in each episode. If you love the movie like I do, check it out.
gusto pod ko mlantaw sa the dark knight rises, pero i dont think it's as good as the first movie ma disappoint rko
It’s like they made two movies: so it starts as movie 1 then it pauses to squeeze in movie 2 (pod racing arc) then it goes back to movie 1!!

@TC1310 @NotJackKemp @machinesports my bad, thought when you were in DC they were going to do a Pod. What's the movie podcast?
Also, @Wolf_TicketsLFC @DaveHendrick_AI and I discussed Goodfellas on this pod http://aichannel.podbean.com/e/ai-movie-night-episode-7-goodfellas/ … No, I'm not from the Wirral.
I watched a movie called POD and there wasn't a pod during the entire film. Completely podless. No podadingo. Podless in Seattle.
Pod was such a bad movie I feel obligated to write down all the reason why you should not watch it.

@starwars Phantom Menace is by far the best movie of the series.Jar Jar, Young Anakin, Pod-Racin',and the guy from @TakenMovies 1-3,nuffsaid
The Pod movie is pretty damn good. Its just not my thing. Not into super intensity. But I enjoyed it.
@OhColeman Oh right! That part was so comparatively charming that I just mentally placed it in a little movie escape pod
@miss_writer its a USB seed pod thingie from the movie Avatar? I think? It changes colors.
@AlexVorkov That's the key. This movie needs more pod racing. #GHWP
Is the pod race from The Phantom Menace the worst scene in movie history?!

@channel33 names for Movie Pod : 1.The Feature. 2. The Film Forum 3. Movie Night. 4.Critic Relief 5. Subtitles 6. On cue. 7. Directors Cut
@bryncntr loved @mickeykeating's Darling at @fantasticfest. This week we watch and discuss @POD_Movie with the amazing @LAC_voyager. #horror
As much as the movie sucks, the pod racing has great sound design
Simmons asking what Kevin Hart and @ChrisRyan77 would talk about on a movie pod (Ryan: "Probably BLOW UP."). Absurd. Too funny
As Malcovich puts a movie in a pod for 100 yrs,what film related fun would you stash away for future film fanatics to find? #EmpirePodcast
@channel33 Movie pod title idea: The Wahtch. @BillSimmons will mention Boston movies every time, so Boston-ise @thewatchpod name.
@channel33 movie pod name ideas: 1) "sneak p33k" (sneak peek) 2) "no passes necessary" (b-ball ref) 3) "setting the pic" (b-ball ref)
So the pod race is the best thing in the movie, genuinely. It plays to Lucas' strengths as an editor in composing action & the pace #tpm
Thanks for doing the job. The comedy, the pod cast, and probably your movie - it makes a lot of people happy. https://twitter.com/TitusNation/status/671651619440726017 …
I wish Jar Jar Binks out his mouth in the pod racer's energy field for the whole movie. #StarWars
Darth Maul is fucking badass and underutilized in this movie. Less pod racing, less Senate, less Gunga. More Darth Maul.
Listen to Michael B Jordan and Bill Simmons pod for some good insight into Creed movie, boxing scenes.

Listened to Michael B Jordan on Simmons' pod this morning. Now I'm at the movie theatre solo waiting for Creed to start.
These scenes feature a monster and actors that do not appear in this movie in any fashion. Also Pod People was never the name of the movie.
Reading up on Pod People’s production. It’s more bizarre than I ever imagined. They started out making a horror movie in Spanish & French…
*comes home from shopping* Aunt:"what movie are the guys watching" me:"Star Wars 1" "how do you know that" me:"the sound of Pod racing duh"
@sarahrstevenson My votes are Werewolf, The Final Sacrifice, and Cave Dwellers or Pod People. Also, the movie. #BringBackMST3K
@ADacome24 Even quicker ending is this: When R2D2 & C3P0 are in the escape pod, if the Star Destroyer, destroyed the escape pod movie over.
Star Wars marathon on Turkey Day. We're at the Pod Race. Confession: I love this movie.

Is the pod race scene in Phantom Menace one of the best chase/race scenes in movie history? I say it's one of the best I've seen.
@andrewgleason @MeteoDesigns Pixar movie idea: the characters are boobs, and they're scared of implants, which are like pod people to them.

@L_Rod15 HELLZ YESSSSSSS! We like two peas in a pod lolol also this movie is so damn good hahaha
Phantom Menace was the first Star Wars movie I saw so for all it's flaws I still enjoy it. Even the pod race.
Episode 1 is a movie of highs and low. The lows are bad, but the highs (lightsaber duel and pod racing) are very impressive.

Part of my dick was cut off when I was baby and everyone is like "yeah, so?" it's like being in some crazy pod people horror movie.
The absolute worst part of Ep. I is how throughly convinced I was as a child that it was a great movie. Darth Maul and pod racing, man.
Tuesday movie night in the pod just got taken to a whole new level
Also today's movie Los Nuevos Extraterrestres (or for some reason it's English title Pod People) will be the MST3K version too.

I'm slightly angered with everyone was recommending POD. The movie is barely worth the measly 78 minutes. A bad Outer Limits episode.
@JAClark_13 I'm going to watch it later. Pod racing was the best part of that movie. Pod racing is excellent.
went to an antique shop & found a giant pod chair that looks like it fell out of a bad 60s movie. I've never wanted anything so much before
In the movie there are pods that are created with traps to kill people, if you could create a pod what would be in it #ThgFanEvent

@FuckYouScience I've long advocated they could have been boiled down to one movie: Star Wars: Pod Races & Badass Lightsaber Fights. #yoda
Plus Luke can't fight in the movie because he sold his light saber to sell the bills after blowing his money on pod race betting.

@TheFrayMovement @WasimCast @Tanner1495 @DylanWaco How the FUCK does a wrestling pod turn into a Crusing review? You need to see that movie.
@BraveLittlePod I enjoyed the deandre Pod although I really don't see this as a movie. It's a 30 minute ballers episode (NBA edition) tops.

I hope the new Star Wars movie has some pod racing as a treat for the real fans.
@LIVEANDLETDIE00 Yeah that's one of the plot holes in that movie. They give him time to turn his bat-pod and shoot at the truck and escape?
@_Gags_ was surprised to discover the #AIMovieNight pod. You should totally do a superhero /SYFy movie /TV show pod next!! #AIGeekNight :p

A pod cast movie Didn't know the lonely audience had that big an appeal.
I still think Gravity would have been a better movie if Sandra Bullock had been taken by a croc when she swims out of the pod at the end.

@krishgm @piersmorgan two disgraceful peas in a pod. Terrible how you were to @RobertDowneyJr it was a movie interview not about his life.
You have your own movie pod! @moooonshit pic.twitter.com/lg7gEefcz6
@loxyisme I think the next one will be a prequel movie. Young Liam Neeson was a pod racer who befriends a robot & an older stoic Liam Neeson
Sometimes when I'm between waking up and sleep I feel turbulence and also the feeling that I am incased in pod. Like in the matrix movie.
I hear in the new Jurassic Park movie, you get to see the T-Rex as a little kid who pod races.
@crsryan @SamuelAAdams @ThePlaylist It’s a five-minute TV pod slot for a comic book movie. You *can* ask that q there, but gotta nail it.
My dad found me watching "Space Travelers" ~ 91 & recognized the movie. He was also pretty sure he'd seen Pod People @ the theater. #mst3k

Currently watching Phantom Menace, and say what you will about this movie but the pod race is amazing! Even if it's not necessary.
I saw it again the next day at noon with my dad I made peace with that movie. "Pod race is good and that kid won't be in the next one."
