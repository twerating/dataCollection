@ShadowTodd Theodore Rex. It's a movie so terrible, the producer had to sue Whoopie to actually get her to appear in it.
@Nicole_Cliffe there was a novelization of the Whoopi Goldberg / T-Rex buddy cop movie Theodore Rex
I want to make our IMAX projector play Theodore Rex instead of Jurassic World. Far superior movie. People would thank me.
Theodore Rex was the best movie ever made starring Whoppi Goldberg and a talking, animatronic dinosaur.
Wait. Whoppi Goldberg is in the TMNT movie? This better not be another Theodore Rex.

So Whoopi Goldberg just joined the cast of the Ninja Turtles movie...which means it'll be Theodore Rex all over again. JOY.
I wish Whoopi Goldberg was working with THEODORE REX in the new TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES movie.
Buddy cop movie called "Theodore Rex". One cop is a dinosaur, the other cop is Whoopi Goldberg. This is a real film. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY7gsUL9Xkk …
AH RIGHT, THEODORE REX WITH WHOOPI GOLDBERG. that movie sure was scary
Theodore Rex, the movie, was released in this day |http://www.phronzs.com/?simple=25200&amp;ocorr=Theodore+Rex …
Another bad movie I sort of super-love: Theodore Rex.
THEODORE REX IS THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN THOUGH
Went to look up "Theodore Rex", as you do, and found out it was also the title of a Teddy Roosevelt bio that came out AFTER the movie. #why
But for the brain, I will need the incredibly rare, straight to VHS movie Theodore Rex starring Whoopi Goldberg and an animatronic dinosaur.
@ywxwy Today i discovered the Whoopi Goldberg movie, Theodore Rex (1995). Blew my mind. http://youtu.be/dY7gsUL9Xkk 
"In 1995 Whoopi Goldberg starred in a $33 million straight-to-video buddy cop movie with a puppet dinosaur called Theodore Rex" (via reddit)
@akafroman3 Super Weird 90s Movie... "Theodore Rex" with Whoopi Goldberg pic.twitter.com/YZsup43cRx
@DOB_INC My brother once said he was reading Theodore Rex (about Roosevelt) and I thought he meant the novelization of the movie :/
So, @MadamComicBook reminded me of a movie, http://youtu.be/dY7gsUL9Xkk  Theodore Rex.or this is what 33 million gets you. Direct to Video.

I was able to laugh at the GPK Movie due to its rampant 80's-ness and weirdness; Theodore Rex is so bad you can't even laugh at it
but, I did see a pair of awful movies the past few days I saw earlier as a kid... The Garbage Pail Kids Movie and Theodore Rex!
I predict Theodore Rex to come from behind and take the best movie Oscar.
@FutureFriendSA Theodore Rex: the movie starting Whoopi Goldberg and a dinosaur
I am so mad at @mousterpiece Theodore Rex is an amazing movie. Seriously ... Jurassic Park meets Blade Runener http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rsZOIu3sFU …
@BravoAndy ask @WhoopiGoldberg for horror stories about making her worst movie ever "Theodore Rex"
If you ever wondered about my avatar, its s character from a classic movie called Theodore Rex..his name Teddy Rex!
Down one shitty buddy cop movie, one to go. Bring it on, Theodore Rex!
Theodore Rex is the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen Whoopi Goldberg in... She had to have lost a bet.
I just remembered the movie "Theodore Rex" starring Whoopi Goldberg and now I want to set myself on fire.
Winning an Oscar is for suckers. I want to win an Oscar and make a really terrible movie like Snow Dogs or Theodore Rex afterwards.
So last year I got my brother "Theodore Rex", the worst movie ever made. This year I may have outdone myself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3KCDiVUW3w …
'Theodore Rex' - Whoopi Goldberg and a dinosaur team up in a cop buddy movie. How could I have missed this excrescence? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY7gsUL9Xkk&sns=tw …

Call me old-school, but any movie that debuts On Demand first might as well be Theodore Rex to me.
Theodore Rex is probably my favorite movie starring Whoopi Goldberg and a dinosaur.
Media Hunter - Theodore Rex Review: Isaac takes a look at an arguably bad movie. But can it still be fun to watch? http://bit.ly/QtY7DN 
Which movie will Hollywood remake first: THEODORE REX or HOT TO TROT?
Theodore Rex. The movie was Theodore Rex. I'm sure you were on the edge of your seats.
As someone who has watched a lot of bad movies on purpose, I can say, without a doubt, Theodore Rex is the worst movie of all time.
RT @TylerJamesMaas I love that Rickie Weeks movie, "Theodore Rex," where he and that talking dinosaur are cops. He was OK in "Ghost" too.
"I was Sean Penn's dinosaur partner back when he played a future cop in Tree of Life. Like that movie Theodore Rex." #MalickCuts

#GreatEventsInLiberalHistory 1995: Whoopi 'Rape Rape' Goldberg makes Theodore Rex, a movie so spectacular, her modesty dictated its secrecy

Drinking game for Theodore Rex: semi-successful. Problem: too drunk by end of movie to know what the hell is going on.
@nedroid I wonder sometimes if the author of Theodore Rex (the biography one) was even aware of Theodore Rex (the terrible movie)?
@TVWithoutPity @manostorgo Is this a prequel to the Whoopi Goldberg buddy-cop-with-a-dinosaur movie Theodore Rex?
@j_kruk: it doesnt matter anyway, the entire movie industry peeked at Theodore Rex. its been nothing but drivel since then.

Theodore Rex: (1) award winning TR bio by Edmund Morris, (2) buddy cop movie w/ Whoopi Goldberg and a dinosaur (http://youtu.be/M-5l-gxFd7E )

@tinky022 @rainnwilson we were totally talking about this movie at work yesterday. Is Theodore Rex making a comeback?
@rainnwilson If Theodore Rex fought the Country Bears from the Country Bears movie to the death, who'd win? Besides America, I mean.
Happy birthday to Theodore Rex! (Not that crappy '96 movie; the 26th President of the USA, Teddy Roosevelt, born this day in 1858)
I think I would rather read Theodore Rex the biography of Theodore Roosevelt again than to keep watching the movie starring Whoopi Goldberg.
Theodore Rex is the best movie i have ever watched. #AWESOME http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-5l-gxFd7E …

I have A LOT of random novelizations. Including one for the movie Theodore Rex which is strange as I have never watched the actual film.
I love how the Commissioner in the movie has a hard time recognizing Theodore Rex, you know, the one dinosaur police officer.
I think this movie might possibly be worse than Theodore Rex :)

@snthebaseline In my mind, there's a single perfect movie that combines "Eddie" and "Theodore Rex."
Tfest: Theodore Rex is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it might be the most annoying. I'd rather watch Baby Geniuses 2.
@psychwrites In the episode, "65 Million Years Off" does Shawn name Zippy after the dog from the movie Theodore Rex?
Theodore Rex is a movie about Whoopi Goldberg as a cop who's partners with a dinosaur. EVERY MOVIE YOU CAN DREAM UP HAS BEEN MADE.
