Christmas Vacation is such a great movie Its not uncommon for me to see it 2-3 times a year. :P
Christmas Vacation is the best Christmas movie ever made. Non-negotiable.
@ScottFoxonair it was funny. But nowhere near the funniest Christmas movie ever. That still goes to Christmas Vacation. #mvoiegeeks
If Christmas Vacation isn't your favorite Christmas movie, I might need to re-evaluate our friendship.
The movie Vacation is one of the funniest movies I've watched!
Home Alone isn't my fav Christmas movie. It just gets me in the spirit. Christmas Vacation, Scrooged and the Look Who's Talking w the dogs.
Watching Christmas Vacation because it's the only movie that matters
Lmao so my family watched the movie vacation the other day and now my parents just asked me what a rimjob is
The movie vacation is too funny, my goodness
I kind of wanted to see the Moby Dick movie they've been showing trailers for the past 3 years it seems like, but then I redboxed Vacation.
Our library is insane. They had Inside Out, San Andreas, Vacation Movie and we got them all for the next 3 days... who can say move night?

Manson Family Vacation is an awesome movie. It's on Netflix so you can chill too.
The only part of Christmas I can honestly say I adore, is National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. That movie is my childhood.
