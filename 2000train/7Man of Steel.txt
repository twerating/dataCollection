@LordRetail The writer also hates MAN OF STEEL. Our book is opposite of MOS movie.
If you liked the movie Man of Steel you should probably be on the Superman American Alien series. Especially issue #2 this week.
For example: Starsky & Hutch movie (bizarre reinterpretation), the later Die Hard sequels, Jurassic World (bland & robotic), Man of Steel.

A year later and I still think "Batman & Robin" is a better DC movie than "Man of Steel"
@emmatarver92 My disdain for it as a movie aside im not even sure I consider Man of Steel a Superman story. Fundamentally misunderstands him
@TheShadowBender i recommend you watch Man of Steel, pree my last couple of tweets and you see the movie is really comedic in nature
Man of Steel is not only the best Superman movie... It is a good movie.

Is the Batman vs Superman movie a sequel to Man of Steel? Dark Knight Rises? Or The Social Network? http://youtu.be/yViIi3gie2c  #BatmanvSuperman
@MeowTeChing @PwnParrot They made a movie out of Superman64. Called Man of Steel.
@JNeurosciRes I can see that. But it was a big mistake to use the team that made the very un-fun Man of Steel movie.
@PatKelves17 idc if people hated on Man of Steel. That movie was great
I feel like they should've saved Doomsday for Man of Steel 2 or the Justice League movie.
Man of Steel wasn’t a memorable movie at all, if you wanna be real honest. I wouldn’t put it above any of those “trash” Marvel movies
The #BatmanvSuperman trailer did give a lot away, it gave away that unlike Man of Steel, this movie has a sense of humor.

@VoiceOfTheStar @vegasdrew420 dc did good with the Nolan/Bale batman movies, especially Dark Knight, but Man of Steel was a mediocre movie

I am angry about things before even seeing the movie. Are they deliberately trying to make fans angrier than they did in Man of Steel?
You know why DC gon have the better movie this time? Them super fights. Man of Steel had the best damn fight sequences I ever seen
I really wish Man of Steel and the justice league movies had the same tone as the Dark Knight. The 1st MoS trailer had it. Movie didn't.
@Mada_AC @Dainesyy even if dc is trying to catch up, making a mini justice league movie isnt how to do it, this is a man of steel sequel LOL
The last Superman movie featured the Man of Steel throwing General Zod through multiple skyscrapers. Good luck, Batman.
the weirdest part about BvS trailer is that the original Man of Steel had some of the best comic book movie trailers I've ever seen
That Batman v Superman trailer was pretty good. I mean, the Man of Steel trailer was better than the movie, so grain of salt, but still.
This Sunday I will be doing Movie Night skwad. Man of Steel! Get your popcorn ready. ps Go get the movie if you haven't.
The trailer of this movie even says that superman is not going to kill him so there ya go: chief problem with man of steel resolved!
Would like to see the comic about Superman from the movie Man of Steel. pic.twitter.com/NkJpQ5bLXr
They should have saved Doomsday for the Second man of steel movie and after superman wake up from his coma they jump into JL. Idk lol
@tbwhall Man of Steel was the worst superhero movie ever. Worse than Elektra. Worse than any Fantastic Four.
also i think we've had enough batman, also man of steel sucked ass, idk why this isnt just a wonder woman movie
So the Batman v Superman trailer #3 just gave away the whole movie so now the title should just be changed to Man of Steel 2: Doomsday
3rd trailer for Man of Steel was incredible but the movie got mixed reviews. B v S trailer mixed reaction but maybe good reviews? #DontBeBad
Man of Steel isn't about Superman. Watch that movie again (or don't) and you'll notice that it's Zod's movie.
@Fatedlime I do wish they did a movie about Jor El and Zod. I LOVED that first part of man of steel.
maybe I should actually watch Man of Steel............I feel asleep three separate times when trying to start that movie
Free of context, Man of Steel might have been a good movie, but it was a terrible Superman movie.

Not that I know that BvS is a horrible movie, but based on Man of Steel and Sucker Punch I don't like it's chances.
This movie looks funbad, like Man of Steel. That movie was funbad.
While we're at it, let's revisit MAN OF STEEL, and say that it's a terrible movie that makes the wrong decision at every turn.
#BatmanvSuperman looks to be a bit more contained than Man of Steel. MoS was more of a world-changing event movie.
I hope who ever did that fight scene in man of steel does one for a DBZ movie .. With a lil kung fu in it.
The movie seems to be a true to form Man of Steel sequel. It is a bit out of place as a sequel to the Nolan Batman films.
All I see today! Batman vs superman! And to me that movie just looks like a boring fight scene just like man of steel!
@misterpatches @RussFrushtick Man of Steel was a bad movie due a singular bad vision. Batman V Superman looks like it may be bad by comittee
I think the movie itself will be fine but nowhere near the greatness (yeah, I said it!) of MAN OF STEEL.

They basically gave away the whole fucking movie in that BvS trailer. I know I'll end up disappointed like with Man of Steel.
Much like Man of Steel, I forsee people nitpicking the shit out of the movie instead of enjoying it. A shame really. #BatmanvSuperman
nothing spectacular about the Batman v superman trailer. This movie will just be average like man of steel.
But given this is the follow up to Man of Steel, a movie that was like watching a twenty car pile up in slo mo, it'll turn to fisticuffs.
@tp_bpl wait, you mean kind of like how man of steel was an awful movie?
"when did you read comics?" *since after man of steel movie* pic.twitter.com/xqDZ3xcbE9
I love that Superman being dumb in Man of Steel and levelling a whole city to stop Zod is the plot device for this movie.
It would be pretty cool if the next Man of Steel movie was based on Superman:Doomed
@jstanko99 hmmm man of steel was not a good movie, it felt more like indie rock song video though...
Notice how the supposed sequel to Man Of Steel is called Batman vs Superman? I think its more Batman's movie than Superman's movie.
I'd love to see a Superman movie that really is genuinely about Superman coming into his own. (Man of Steel failed at this - hard)

I remember being really excited by the Man of Steel trailer. Then I watched the movie... #BatmanvSuperman
@Rowdogeaster @ty_carlton cavil is a good actor man the script for Man Of Steel just wasn't good I'm confident in this movie this needs to
This has that whole 'Man of Steel' feeling to it. Trailer looked crazy, movie was garbage. #BatmanvSuperman
Man of steel was better than superman returns ..but it still wasn't a good movie. I hope bvs is good and it launches DCCU properly
Imagine Man of Steel if the whole movie had taken place on the crab boat.
Man of Steel was dope. It could have been better yes, but it was still the best PURE superman movie they've mad.
Still, the movie could be rad if it makes a point of showing the costs of Man of Steel's recklessness
That trailer. I have no idea what to think. Maybe this movie will be better than Man of Steel? In the meantime, I really like The Flash.
On the one hand excited about Diana on the other hand "Man of Steel" was the worst movie I've seen. No exaggeration. Worse than The Hobbit.
@abbydarkstar yep I want this movie to be good at least be better then man of steel
WATCH SYNDER FUCK UP THE BATMAN VS SUPERMAN MOVIE LIKE HE DID TO WATCHMEN, 300 AND MAN OF STEEL. MARK MY WORDS FUCCBOIZ
@MindOf_SH1 It's not really his sequel anymore, Man of Steel 2 got put on the back burner for this movie.
After MAN OF STEEL in 2013, Max Landis undid that movie here: https://youtu.be/aw_GlYve_Lg  Now, BvS's Lex Luthor seems a lot like Landis.
Batman vs Superman, if the trailer is any indication, the movie is going to be worse then Man of Steel, my current #1 worst movie.
I'm thinking about that flippin man of steel movie Why that filter though
@Mustard_Papi Lmaoooo. I figured if they could get man of steel right, they could pull off a real good dbz movie
@INDIGOLD__ yup. It all ties together man of steel BvS and the new batman movie.
Man of Steel also still a trash movie so that's what took away from this at first. Nonetheless though it's gonna be epic
"Man of Steel was aiiiight. but when we getting a new Batman movie tho?" - Batman movie only idiots
@eldeviouswolf @LeanandCuisine this what people said about the man of steel trailer yet it offer so much more in the movie. Just wait
Thought it was underrated RT @REHAB_: Man of Steel was a legit good movie
@StevenABowman Because Man of Steel was just ok and this trailer showed the whole movie!
. @DukeOfZamunda brought up a good point tho. they canceled a sequel to Man of Steel just so we can have another Batman movie
@DefunctGames I still think there's plenty left. Man of Steel teased that Zod/Superman would fight and the full movie still packed punch.
Marvel movies got the comedy nd them summer blockbuster moments (that they give away in the previews) but Man of Steel was a whole MOVIE
lowkey annoyed that im gonna have to watch man of steel before seeing bvs ive never been able to stay awake for that whole movie
I get doomsday being in the movie because in the comics he actually kills the man of steel, but this doesn't look like the doomsday I know.
At least it looks like they've lightened the mood a bit, Man of Steel was way too dark for a Superman movie. #BatmanvSuperman
@theshrillest obviously man of steel, the cooking movie, American hustle, tons of TV Shows, she just don't it for me bruh.especially as Lois
But I like the way they linked the movie to Man of Steel. But I want to see how Wonder Woman and Flash will be introduced sha
Second avengers was trash tbh. Man of steel better than any marvel movie
@SuperheroFeed just remember man of steel everyone thought it was too much then look what we were awarded with when we saw the movie
@sixxcinn After Man of Steel I know not to want much out of the movie beyond some fun visuals and it looks like it'll have a lot of that.
So is this movie about Batman versus Superman? League vs. Lex? League vs. Doomsday? Man of Steel continuation? Setting up Batman? AQUAMAN?!
More hyped for the supermann part .... Man of Steel was the first good Superman movie. I hope they don't go backwards
They should have saved Doomsday for the Justice League movie or actual Man of Steel sequel where he dies/returns.
Loved Man of Steel. Great movie.
No Idea what makes y'all believe this DC universe is worth shit after that trash ass Man Of Steel movie.
@sgtalkstoomuch Also anything at this point will trump Man of Steel, and yes I remember I was kind to that movie when it came out
@DragonflyJonez same happened with man of steel and we got to see so much more in the movie, this is gonna be beautiful
@andyparkart it's not Marvel movie good, but it's not Man of Steel terrible either.
Man of Steel was perfect tbh besides a few minor coloring adjustments. I enjoy it, a lot of stuff happen to squeeze into one movie.
@HeIs_KING I'm just tired of Man of Steel bashers. They the ones who act like the movie gone be bad
I swear, this movie better not go Man of Steel on me. Especially now that I'm actually excited for it and think that it looks good.
The new BATMAN V. SUPERMAN trailer literally gives the whole movie away. Big improvement on MAN OF STEEL, but I just watched the WHOLE THING
Man Of Steel was the first movie in the DC cinematic universe. Dawn of Justice will kick off and show multiple heroes
@airlinem The IMAX trailer for Man of Steel was maybe the best Superman movie ever made!
@AnaMardoll I was done with *this* movie before Man of Steel ended.
How can ppl honestly say man of steel wasn't good. IMO it was An amazing movie. Are they really upset that superman killed Zod ??
@LeanandCuisine man of steel better than almost every marvel movie put out past 3 years
The only movie from this series was Man of Steel and that wasn't really much of a prequel to this epic battle..
Im usually a marvel dude, but in all honesty i'll take the Dark Knight and Man of steel movies over any marvel movie.
Please don't repeat man of Steel.Released too many trailers and the movie just looked like a compilation of trailers https://twitter.com/BatmanvSuperman/status/672279177869942785 …
As excited as I am for Batman V Superman. Man of Steel had some of the best trailers I've ever seen and the movie was mediocre at best.
@Spector_Vision I was more excited for this movie then ever it was redeeming man of Steel for me. But now they hit the breaks
I am enjoying the fuck out of this trailer because I know if the movie is anything like Man of Steel then I won't like it.
I haven't been this excited for a movie since man of steel! I CANT WAIT! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro&feature=youtu.be …
Damnit, I am hyped for #BatmanvSuperman. That trailer was great. I really hope Ilike the movie more than Man of Steel.
@EzugoO @SpacemanLozo @chrisant0501 there is more destruction in this movie than man of steel
after the trainwreck that was man of steel I'm excited to see how this new movie pans out
I hope the movie's approach is "let's try to retcon Man of Steel into a good movie and totally intentional" and not just the marketing

Watched the man of steel with BvS in mind last night... Whole different movie. Mad fire emojis.
Man of Steel is a reeally good super hero movie in my opinion. Not great due to lack of development in the louis n clark aspect.

This Batman vs Superman teaser looks like the version of Superman that Man of Steel haters pretended THAT movie had
"I thought I'd joined an exercise cult, forgot I was even in a movie". - Michael Shannon talking about Man of Steel tonight.
@ThatAndyRoss I'm not a fan of Nolan's Batman films. I did like Man of Steel for all the fights, but it definitely isn't a good movie.
@asig_chris Man of Steel is my favorite movie.

@mike_hollan It just doesn't look like a good movie to me. I hated Man of Steel. Zack Snyder doesn't get Superman's character at all.
MAN OF STEEL WAS A GOOD MOVIE i will fight you on this
@stevekovach even if it's twice the movie MAN OF STEEL WAS it'll still be tragically terrible
You can generally poke a hole in every argument that someone who hates Man of Steel makes against the movie
If any Marvel movie caught the level of petty criticism that Man of Steel got it wouldn't survive the review.

Kevin Costner doesn't live long enough in Man of Steel and I'm watching this movie for the first time and I'm a little too late dammit Kevin
I'm not the biggest Man of Steel fan or defender.. It's an a 7.5/10 movie IMO. But even I say that people to get TF over that movie
@DanSlott That has always been an elseworld's kind of depiction. I strongly feel that this movie will Supplement the Man of Steel
@DanSlott I didn't like the Man of Steel movie my self. But again the Scene is Clearly a dream sequence.
ok listen i had the biggest crush on this super man actor when the man of steel movie was new so im hype !! https://twitter.com/batmanvsuperman/status/671507425862680576 …
@RyanHigginsRyan Man of Steel. Green Lantern movie. Identity Crisis. Goth music. Forgive me if I don't see you as the arbiter of taste.
I still have my ticket for Man of Steel. I'm determined to watch every DCEU movie in theaters.
Just notice it's not batman "vs" superman but "V" V = 5 in roman numeral 5 what ? 5th movie. Of who ? Batman 3, Man of Steel 1 3+1=4+1= V

I'll be honest. I like Man of Steel more than any MCU movie.
Man of Steel was better than Iron Man 2 & 3 and so far every Thor movie. It isn't that bad
Crazy idea but if Man of Steel had the Marvel opening sequence, would the movie get as much hate as it does today?
@paperdoll Man of Steel isn't even Superman. There is no hope. Just destruction and leveling a city for half a movie.
I really don't get the man of steel hate, that movie was quality compared to the more modern shit
@Navglad @Forever_Erica Man of Steel was an ok action movie. It was a shitty Superman movie.
@fruitsareedible he also looks exactly like what you'd expect Bruce Wayne to. I liked Man of Steel. First Superman movie I enjoyed.
@jsnell after Man of Steel I have ZERO faith in this movie or the franchise moving forward.
Current movie Superman doesn't inspire hope. Ppl hate him in da BvS trailer. Can't blame em since he destroyed half da planet n Man of Steel
sigh I don't know. I feel like the movie will be as lame and bad as Man of Steel.
"But Superman is not a beacon of hope bla bla bla" You have a full movie called 'Man of Steel' where he is becoming that [+]
@mprshane I know I'll likely enjoy the movie. A lot. I also loved Man of steel. I make the choices other people hate.
BvS clip is very bland. That movie will be better than Man of Steel, but I'm still not sure by how much.

A dude in my hosue keeps lobbing questions at MAN OF STEEL; not q's bout the codex but q's that make me think he's never seen a movie before
Man of steel. I've watched this movie so many times I know all the words to it
Hate it when I'm fixing To go to bed then a great movie comes on.....curse you Man of Steel...
Man of steel my favorite movie OF ALL TIME
man of steel is such a good movie
Seeing Man of Steel on TV makes me so excited for the Batman vs Superman movie in March!
Man of Steel is such a great movie
The movie Man of Steel did not get enough credit
I know it's a movie, but I feel like no ones ever addressed the fact that in Man of Steel the aliens from galaxies away speak fluent English
Watching man of steel. I love this movie.
Man Of Steel is such a kick ass movie.
I gave Man of Steel a chance, but just can't get being spreading an origin story over 120+ minutes. Least Superman Superman movie ever.
Watching Man of Steel. How have I never seen this movie?
I'm like one of the few people who actually likes the Man of Steel movie and I'm not a #Superman fan.
The movies I have went to the movie theater so far has been the martian, intersteller, man of steel, the avengers, and captain America
Man of Steel is the best Superman movie if you consider he has a beard in it but the worst Superman movie after everything without the beard
Man of steel is such a trash movie
the music and dialogue of man of steel is so soothing i always have the movie running in the background when i'm studying (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧

When Man of Steel finally gets semi interesting an hour and 26 minutes into the movie
The more I watch the fight scenes in Man of Steel, I'm convinced that a live-action Dragonball Z movie is possible
Nothing like watching Man of Steel, man I love this movie. Can't wait til Superman V Batman

Basically, Man of Steel is the most confused and yet, pretentious superhero movie to date.
Man of Steel is the movie equivalent of that old question, "If God is all powerful, can he create a stone even God cannot lift?"
Man of Steel, Die Hard 5... remember when movie heroes didn't kill as many or more innocent bystanders as the villains?
Booster Gold & Blue Beetle movie, Bird of Prey movie, Man of Steel 2, and Batman Solo films must = 3 DC movies/year right?

@brandalorian next thing you will say is that Man of Steel was a good movie. Jeez
@TeamSuperman It was a good movie for what it was. Though, at that time, I was hoping for what Man of Steel did. Still. It was good.
Just finished "Man of Steel," which was the first real Superman movie I've ever watched. Loved it a lot.
Quick Reminder: Man of Steel is still an awful movie.
I don't really care who stars in The Flash movie. I care that someone doesn't miss the point and make it grimdark as Man of Steel.

@EverFlores07 @SuperBroMovies Man of Steel tried to be like TDK trilogy, but doesn´t count as a good comic book movie ;)
@OlieDaOwl @6pat6rick6 You're delusional if you actually think Man Of Steel is a good movie

To be fair, literally every other TV/movie version of Superman, Supergirl, Superboy, Krypto, etc is better than MAN OF STEEL.
@SuperheroFeed I love this. Man of steel is awful. It's chaotic, it's overstuffed. I do like the actors but not the movie.
Anthony Mackie doesn't like the "Man of Steel" movie and he also supports Donald Trump.. Yeah. Let that sink in.
But if Anthony Mackie is being serious, who gives a shit? It's his opinion. Man of steel isn't a perfect movie like ya'll make it to be tbh
@HellBlazeRaiser @supergirlcbs it really was good. I enjoyed it so much more than the newest Superman Man of Steel movie.
@siegarettes man of steel is the worst fucking superhero movie ever made lmao
@colliderfrosty I too could watch Man of Steel on a loop. Why can't a person like a movie they want to like? And why was it bad again?
Man of steel is such a good movie, i don't know how anyone can say otherwise
Man of Steel wasn't the perfect movie but it certainly doesn't deserve all the hate it's getting right now
@SupesBatsy man of steel is the best movie ever
I love Captain America: Winter Soldier, but Man of Steel is a movie that I love WAY more. #AndIThinkItsABetterMovieToo #MyOpinion
Great you made me go there now. :-/ but that's okay anything for the GOAT man of steel movie :-D
@colliderfrosty nah, Man of Steel was better than any throwaway Marvel movie!
Had to pause Supergirl after the fun, first 15 min to watch all 3 Man of Steel trailers. Those Nolan trailers fooled me into a Snyder movie.

The only thing that I didn't like about the Man Of Steel movie is how they killed off Jonathan Kent.
No *YOU* keep switching between Man of Steel and Superman Returns and imagining a movie with the good points of each and none of the bad.

Man of Steel was a good movie. Fight me.
can we appritiate that in man of steel he had a blue heeled growing up? also it was a good movie!
Superman and his farther are clearly the villains in Man of Steel, the movie.
MOVIE REVIEW - Man of Steel - Good action, great effects, mediocre story, with predictable plot sequences and really cheesy dialogue. 5/10

Wow...Man Of Steel is a really bad movie.
Sorry for the Man of steel spam. I love this movie.
I forgot how good the movie Man Of Steel is. Im gluuuuued!
PSA: don't ever watch Man of Steel with your grandad. He will just criticize the movie the entire time and everything that is wrong
This my first time watchin man of steel n tgis movie good af
2013's Man of Steel is the BEST Superman movie to date and I can give a research paper as to why it is if you think differently
"man of steel" is such a good movie
The movie "Man of steel" kinda got me emotional wtf lmao whyyyyyy.
i've said this before & i'll say it again, despite its polarized critical reaction, man of steel is the best superhero movie of all time.
Watching Man Of Steel. Wicked good movie. Gonna watch Air after.
@terrance_may look through the man of steel tag on Twitter. People love the movie. Whenever I see someone saying "everyone hated it" I laugh
Man of Steel is an awesome movie!
Man of steel is a very under appreciated movie
Man of Steel is on FX. I honestly don't understand people that don't like this movie. It's fucking perfect
Favorite movie on Man of Steel
FX IS SHOWING MAN OF STEEL!! THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE pic.twitter.com/2887IB443O
...why does man of steel have the longest intro ever?? tHIS IS WHY I RARELY WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ONLY WATCH IT FOR HENRY AND DYLAN
Man of Steel on FX. I’m reminded that Michael Shannen is the only good thing in an otherwise terrible movie.
"Man of steel" still a dope movie
First time I saw man of steel was with #oomf at the AMC dine in theater and didn't even make it through the movie cause I was so drunk lol
Watching Man of Steel on FX right now. You haters can say what you want, but Peanut the Puggle is *All In* on this movie. #Krypto
Even though Man of Steel has its flaws, its a good Superman origin story movie, plus its wayyyy better than Superman Returns

@Steele131 me too that fisrt 45 minutes of man of steel is just a small glimpse of wats to come to the DC movie universe
Man of Steel was a mediocre mess. I still stand by that opinion. But the destruction of Metropolis was NOT the main issue with that movie.
Man of Steel is the best movie DC has made thus far.

Batman v Superman is continuing the story that happened in Man of Steel. That's pretty much what he means. It's not Superman's movie.
Obviously we know Batman v Superman is a continuation (or "sequel") to MoS, but it is it's own thing, not a Superman "Man of Steel" movie.
WHY DOES EVERYBODY ALWAYS HATE ON MAN OF STEEL IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE LIKE WHAT
Zack Snyder confirms Batman v Superman is Man of Steel 2... LOL god this movie...
Batman v Superman is obviously a sequel to Man of Steel. what I (and probably a lot of people) mean for MOS2 is a standalone Supes movie.
@SuperheroFeed @KyleKmann98 No way. The idea of Batman v Superman will sell tickets even if the movie sucks like Man of Steel.

Watching Man of Steel. Casting is amazing, performances are amazing, costumes, locations: everything is great except for the movie itself.
Watched Man of Steel. Honestly, smashing even more and more material in a movie based on an old story concept doesn’t really help.

MOVIE REVIEW - Man of Steel - Good action, great effects, mediocre story, with predictable plot sequences and really cheesy dialogue. 5/10
For a movie which came out in 2013 people who hate it still talk about Man Of Steel like it came out yesterday.
@SpinkyMJB "All the directors"? So far, the only movie we have seen is Man of Steel lol. Ridiculous...
I just realized The Iron Giant is a better Superman movie than Man of Steel. Which is kind of sad.

Hey Zack Snyder, Guardians is the smallest comic book property to be made into a movie ever, but it made 40 million more than Man of Steel.
@comicsalliance But I've literally never seen a superhero movie as bad a Man of Steel. Worse than the cheesiest 80s. It pretends to be good.
So Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice is a Batman movie with Superman in it. I like Batman but isn't it still a Man of Steel sequel sort of
Someone who directs Man of Steel has no right to throw shade at Ant-Man. Man of Steel was a crappy movie.
after Man of Steel Watchmens probly the waviest superhero movie ever tbh
@robertcyoung @BlackGirlNerds I mean I didn't even pay to see man of steel or bats in the theaters cause I'm so choosey with my movie $

Man of Steel has more staying power than any MCU movie. Has anyone brought up Captain America when it doesn't concern any of the sequels?

i mean lbr man of steel is such a boring movie and most of us watched it bc of henry cavill
Every time Zack Snyder is publicly dismissive of Marvel, it reminds me that nearly *every* MCU movie is better than MAN OF STEEL.
Ant-Man is such a better movie than Man of Steel. Remember when Superman destroyed Metropolis, and then kissed Lois Lane after it all?
“ @Mysterious_1050: Man of steel is one of those movie that gets better on repeat viewings IMO” Doesn't leave my channel if it's on.

The Man of Steel is such an awesome movie, going to be twiddling my thumbs for ages for another DC release though
@MOMO_js So did man of steel. The trailer of the movie was so awesome but yeah since this has 3 heroes and some JL Cameos it might be good.
If I had to watch one movie over and over again, it would definitely be... man of steel #MoviesOnLoop
When I see Man of Steel in color, I see a Superman movie. Now I hope that BvS will be a Superman movie, but... Zack Snyder's in charge.

@Greymattersplat fantastic four is a better Superman movie than man of steel, iron giant is the truest Superman movie ever made
So after watching "Man of Steel" movie, if one asks me for a verdict on it, I'm guessing my only words are ... COLLATERAL DAMAGE!!!! 
Watching the original and best Superman movie. The Richard Donner one from 1978. None of that man of steel shite.
I found a new movie podcast where the crew loves Man of Steel and hates 2014 Godzilla. Sounds like a podcast for me.

Why judge that George Miller would be "forced" to shoot a Man of Steel 2 like Snyder? Suicide Squad doesn't look like a Snyder movie
If directing man of steel 2 guarantees the licence to do whatever he pleases with the next mad max movie then fair enough

George Miller directing Man of Steel 2 is just a rumour, but it's about the only thing that would make me at all interested in that movie.
I would much rather George Miller direct a MAD MAX sequel (or just a FURIOSA movie) before MAN OF STEEL 2 tho.
George Miller for Man of Steel 2? Hope it happens, Mad Max Fury Road damn good movie man and he can make Man of Steel 2 much better
Movie news - Here's your big rumor of the day: Will Man of Steel 2 have a furiously talented director? http://bit.ly/1Jw0k31  #movies #film
Rumour that Miller could direct Man of Steel 2. I'm all for letting him have at it. Made the best action movie (so far) of 2015.
@digifreak642 every time I see that acronym I'm like "but Man of Steel is a bad movie... ohhhhhhhhh, Masters of Sex".
I always felt that if you're gonna make a Superman movie called Man of Steel, the sequel has gotta be Man of Tomorrow.
@GraemeHarwell @jeffreyakemp it's true. Like it or hate it, Man of Steel is a Synder movie. SS looks like a full on Ayer movie
So George Miller might be direction Man of Steel 2, after his Justice League movie fell through. I'm sure because of the recent Mad Max.
If this rumour about George Miller directing Man of Steel 2 is true, then is there a point to make any other superhero movie till then?
Kinda wanted to see Man from UNCLE until I found out the main character is played by Superman from Man of Steel. Horrible, horrible movie.
If George Miller directs Man of Steel 2, it'll be game over for every superhero movie which isn't The Dark Knight, deadass

To all haters of Man of Steel, at least WB can give us a better Superman movie then Fox can with Fant4stic while they resist Marvel.
Saw #ManFromUNCLE a movie good enough to warrant a second watching. This is not the stiff Henry Cavill I remember from Man of Steel
Up at 3AM. Figured I would watch Man of Steel. Movie is WAY better than I remember it.

@DaBeardedXeno I've had 1 word to really describe this movie. Overkill! Man of Steel felt the same way. Way Too much destruction!
Watched The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Excellent spy movie, go watch it. And in spite of Man of Steel, Henry Cavill can act!
@TheFireRises20 I love Watchmen and Man of Steel. If Snyder nails BvS then he'll be my favourite comic book movie director.
Thinking that Man of Steel was a 2013 movie and I have only seen it now, it was okay. xD Not as good as The Dark Night trilogy though. Haha.

I, to this day, find myself re-watching the second Man of Steel trailer and thinking "where did that movie go?".
@ConsilienceDVO @SuperheroFeed this has nothing to do with DC, and DC only has one movie: Man of Steel from 2013.
@MKupperman Man of Steel should be the ultimate children's movie, instead it's this dark, dreary bullshit trying to imitate the dark knight

Favourite superhero movie: MAN OF STEEL. Yes, some questionable stuff, but amazing action that does *not* go on too long.
MOVIE REVIEW - Man of Steel - Good action, great effects, mediocre story, with predictable plot sequences and really cheesy dialogue. 5/10

Finally got around to watching "Man of Steel". That movie was fantastic.
@Queentette I saw that in a movie once It was called Man of Steel.
We all have embarrassing moments. For DC it was the man of steel movie. For Marvel it was the new fantastic 4.
also Megamind is a far better Superman movie than Man of Steel
@ljacone I liked Man of Steel because it wasn't the same film. Superman Returns was the same movie as Superman.

This movie is a shitty tween drama like Divergent mixed with a terribly misjudged and confusing mess anti-superhero movie like Man of Steel
Watching Man Of Steel, this movie never stoped being awesome.
The entire cast, unconvincing tbh. It's true, it didn't feel like a superhero movie. Had a man of steel vibe going on
Ant-Man had all of the heart, the hope and the charm that Man Of Steel SHOULD have had. Very good movie. Marvel Studios does it again.

Ant-Man wasn't great movie, but at least had humility, sense of fun. Batman v Superman trailer reminded me how humorless Man of Steel was.
Look, don't knock getting fucked up and watching a universally-derided comic book movie. This method made MAN OF STEEL work, people.

Wow! Man of steel became an A- movie after watching it again
If you think about it man of steel is a pretty creepy movie. Music is all loud and distorted general zod is a maniac and superman is odd :P

@Masked_Demon Man of Steel is more than a movie, it's a way of life. Better invest in armadillo armor now, and keep your eyes open.
Rumor – how amazing would it be if Director George Miller of #MadMax fame was chosen to direct the next Man of Steel movie?! #movierumors

So let me get this straight. DC has a universe like Marvel. Man of Steel is the start, Suicide Squad is another movie in it. BvS as well?
Man of steel is a great movie.

When you think about it, 'Man of Steel' is a weird name for a movie. Just say it over and over in your head. Slowly. Man of Steel.
Boy, somewhere between Superman Returns and Man of Steel, there's a perfect Superman movie. Sucks we're never gonna get it.
Man Of Steel is my favorite Superman movie. It trumps Superman Returns, and the follow ups of the original classic 'Superman' 1978.

MOVIE REVIEW - Man of Steel - Good action, great effects, mediocre story, with predictable plot sequences and really cheesy dialogue. 5/10
I'll never understand why people hate 'Man of Steel' it's such an amazing movie
