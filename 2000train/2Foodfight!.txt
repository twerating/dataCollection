@JonTronShow How do you feel about the creators of Foodfight making a #Tetris movie?
The company that made Foodfight! is directing the Tetris Movie. This should be brought up as a war crime.
I knew that folks were planning a TETRIS movie but I didn't know it was by the nerds who did FOODFIGHT
Oh boy, not only is the Tetris movie being made by the Foodfight! people, it's also being made by the makers of the Mortal Kombat movies!
A Tetris movie from the people who made Foodfight!. Let's hope their hard drives don't get stolen again.
@FB_BMB I was going to say "Maybe it will turn out like the Lego Movie and surprise everyone." But from the makers of Foodfight... nevermind
THE TETRIS MOVIE IS BEING MADE BY THE COMPANY THAT MADE FOODFIGHT- WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?!
<tinaun> why is the director of foodfight making a tetris movie
So the Tetris movie is going to be made by the same people who made "Foodfight!". Well, shit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGql8sKjJwA … (ping @JonTronShow)
The Tetris movie is going to be "an epic sci-fi adventure". Being produced by the producer of Mortal Kombat & Foodfight. ????(0_0)????
The people who made the Mortal Kombat movies and Foodfight are making a Tetris movie: http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/tetris-movie-adaptation-announced?utm_campaign=ign+main+twitter&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social … oh no
A Tetris movie? By Threshold Entertainment? They produced "Foodfight!" Heaven help us!
uninteresting trivia, I reviewed #foodfight for an English class, and got an 'A' despite that fact I have yet to watch the movie to the end.
@rhettandlink Rhett and Link have an imaginary foodfight like from on the movie Hook.

" @TheAVClub: That Tetris movie you’ve been joking about is real http://avc.lu/1ByVKYd " & from the makers of FoodFight!
THE MAKERS OF FOODFIGHT ARE MAKING A TETRIS MOVIE
@scottEweinberg Who in their right mind would give that guy money to make a Tetris movie? Foodfight! was a disaster.
For the last time, the alleged Tetris movie is coming from the guy who made FOODFIGHT! So save your incredulity for 2023.
More articles about the Foodfight! movie: @outlawvern http://bit.ly/1xxQk23  & @indiewire http://bit.ly/1xxQoPc  Still amazes me.
The creator of Foodfight is making a Tetris movie
So the producer of "Foodfight!" is making a movie based on Tetris? I really have no words. I don't know what to say.
Ok. You may have seen they want to make a Tetris movie. http://m.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-83708 … What you may not know is "they" ARE THE MAKERS OF FOODFIGHT.

Hard to believe that Universal partnered with the same studio behind that awful Foodfight! movie.
If you're a fan of the horribly animated movie Foodfight, I have good news: http://www.cartoonbrew.com/dvd/universal-partners-with-foodfight-studio-for-more-cgi-films-103553.html …
I can remember at least half the shots I worked on in Foodfight, and after seeing the movie, still none of them make any sense.

@crescentbeams IITS FROM FOODFIGHT THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD WE ALL SHOULD WATCH IT
biodome is a better movie than foodfight by like a lot
Foodfight! was super uninspired, just him saying "fetish movie" over & over. And the Sailor Moon thing was an ode for not researching.
"Foodfight!" is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen some really bad films.
Watching the movie "Foodfight!". Holy shit is this bad. On top of that I'm only 2 minutes in.
Foodfight! (2012) is like if a conglomerate of grocery store brands hired Don Dimello to write a children's movie.
Go watch a real bad movie instead. #Birdemic #FoodFight
Yo Foodfight the movie looks like it was made in Second Life was it made in Second Life?
Ayy so I can host a movie night on Saturday. Gonna watch Heathers again as well as Foodfight if I can get my hands on it.

@HDTGM Have you guys heard of "Foodfight!"? The trailer: http://youtu.be/uROQ9nplxIY ; the movie: http://youtu.be/4APrSSvvK2g . It's amazing.
@Emperordaein @FallenWhite @PhantomRoxas @Gold_Starz and yet somehow this will have better animation than the movie foodfight
@outlawvern Except unlike Foodfight! The Lego Movie was actually good.
Foodfight is a deadly disease disguised as a movie.
@trutherbot Nah, he's right, not even Thompson could survive the movie FoodFight!
DO NOT WATCH FOODFIGHT THE ANIMATED MOVIE I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW TERRIBLE
Well, that sure was a movie. I wonder how much tiger blood Charlie Sheen was able to afford from this. #Foodfight
This movie's budget all went towards paying off the brands of the mascots they used. And they aren't even big name brands. #Foodfight
Pretty sure 90% of the mascots in this movie were just pulled out of the writers' collective ass. #Foodfight
I'm completely speechless...this movie invented whole new ways of being terrible // Foodfight! (2012) - http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1333711360/tt0249516/ …

"I think I just wet myself, It feels rather nice" #FoodFight is a horrible, Horrible movie.
There will never be a better movie than FoodFight with Charlie sheen
@CLG_Doublerift its a scene from the awful movie "foodfight" but its a pretty sad scene you're lying if you didnt cry
Foodfight, probably the worst animated if not worst movie ever made :/
I'm convinced that the movie 'Foodfight!' never existed and was the result of being friends with fucking furries.
Foodfight might be the greatest movie I've ever seen.
Fact: Kyouko unironically likes the movie Foodfight!
Before THE LEGO® MOVIE there was FOODFIGHT!, a product placement cartoon in the magical world of corporate logos. http://www.outlawvern.com/2014/06/17/foodfight/ …
@Annaliz330 yeah. Last year's movie was Space jam, the year before that was Titanic the Animated Musical. Just be glad it's not Foodfight.
@josiesunicorn it was unbelievable we watched all of the worst movies like bee movie, elf bowling, foodfight, the room!
Do NOT, in all things that is holy, DO NOT watch the movie Foodfight! Just take Nostalgia Critic's advice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf85ZaAfixM …
If there is one thing this movie can do for you, it is make you appreciate good animation in movies all the more. I give Foodfight! 0 stars.
Do you ever regret watching a movie? Like, honest to God regret? I do. I regret watching Foodfight.
Yeah remember that? Every Internet Reviewer was in that movie, it was basically Foodfight with Internet characters.

The more I hear about movies like "Legends of Oz" and "Foodfight!", the easier it seems to make a movie...
I honestly hope I never have to watch the movie Foodfight.
Know what's a terrifying thought, somebody out there in the vastness of the world loved the movie "Foodfight".
@DeusExJuice Foodfight is the most baffling movie I have ever seen.
The movie Foodfight! has Mr. Clean in it for whatever reason
@McDonalds also looks like this guy was made by the same weirdo who made the horrible "Foodfight!" Movie
foodfight might be the worst movie I've ever seen
Foodfight! as well. RT @kismesister: Stitch Has a Glitch is a good movie to watch if you want to cry and regret being able to feel emotions.

It's rare to see a movie whose spiritual void is reflected in the dead eyes of every character. #foodfight
Watching JonTron's review of Foodfight. What audience was this movie made for?
Just saw Foodfight. Best movie ever.
Seriously why is nobody talking about the gay chocolate vampire in this movie #foodfight
Holy shit this movie is about app store and game clones THINK ABOUT IT #foodfight
Foodfight! had a Funny Fartin' Frog and a Funny Fartin' Frenchman. Can't have a non-Pixar CG movie without toilet humor!
I'd rather watch FoodFight twice in a row AND watch the newest SpiderMan movie than watch Tom & Jerry: The Movie don't even play
Is foodfight an intentionally bad movie?
I kid you not I had nightmares about the foodfight movie last night
So I want to watch the movie Foodfight just to laugh at how poorly made it is.

@Whitly12 Foodfight. I wanted to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie, but kept watching anyways. In retrospect, I should have left it off
Ever look at a movie trailer & think "Where did the money go?" Legends of Oz looks like one of those films. (Still better than Foodfight.)
@RobTheWonderful Every movement in the sound wave that came from the movie FoodFight. #RuinAMovieQuote
Foodfight!: "Aw... He gonna rape a squirrel!" Sure enough, this was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I just... well done! Well done.
Foodfight is the kind of movie that needs to be seen to be believed but is not the kind of movie to see alone.

What's the worst movie ever? — Birdemic/FoodFight/That movie I made when I was like 5 http://ask.fm/a/afjna620 
Foodfight has to be the worst animated movie ever made. Just freaking awful.
Also in the movie Foodfight, Dex Dogtective is shown eating raisins. Coincidence?
Going to have to put Foodfight! alongside Potato Men and Movie 43 as one of the worst films I've ever seen. Ugly and oboxious throughout.
@Gumballwatter9 Aaaaah! *washing eyes out with soap and water* Darwin:God Foodfight was a terrible movie. X3
What's your favorite horror movie? — ... Foodfight. http://ask.fm/a/afgml7qg 
TIL about a horrible movie called Foodfight!. Released in 2012 with CGI that looks disappointing next to a playstation 1.
@GNZG88 FoodFight isn't a movie. FoodFight is about a 7.8 on the Richter scale.
Foodfight! Review http://bit.ly/1eogFYd  @TGWTG < Y tu que creías que Titanic 2, 8 crazy nights y Digimon The movie (la gringa) eran malas.
People...run...hide, never watch the #movie Foodfight. Thomas the tank engine has better animation than this shit. This movie really sucks.
So many people on my TL have watched Foodfight... I definitely don't want to see that disgrace of a movie at all.
Just finished watching Foodfight. Wow, what a horrible movie. I kinda wish I didn't now but it's certainly, character building, I guess.

About half the studio didn't make it more than two minutes into the movie. I have beer now. There isn't enough in the world. #FoodFight
@Bootzworth do you even KNOW the horrors we've sat through? Foodfight? Cinderella 3D (the deer one)? Felix the Cat the Movie?

@TGWTG Watched the Foodfight review, funny stuff. but it's a masterpiece compared to Marco Polo: Return to Xanadu. the true worst movie ever
Staring at the Foodfight Poster for a reference for the recent fanart was painful enough, cant imagine what its like watching movie Oo
So everyone is jumping on the foodfight bandwagon it was funny at first but we get it the movie is shit dont need a reivew to tell you that
The Nostalgia Critic’s review of Foodfight alone was enough for me to hate the movie. xP http://tmblr.co/ZUzIdv1CUlQBo 
Just watched Foodfight review, fuck were the producers on acid when this movie was made XD just horrific
I'm also watching Nostalgia Critic's review of Foodfight and my god, is that movie a dive into acid-tripping hell.
The "animation" in that Foodfight! movie made Reboot look like it was done by Studio Ghibli. 45+Million for that piece of shit?
Nostalgia Critic: Foodfight! #movie #review http://www.criticswatch.com/reviews/nostalgia-critic-foodfight?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter …
Nostalgia Critic sure hates it when movie credits stretch out long and add scenes. Inspector Gadget, Master of Disguise, now Foodfight.

In case you were wondering, @nathanrabin was right—FOODFIGHT! is an aggressively shitty movie (more info here: http://www.avclub.com/article/supermarket-brands-sponsored-case-file-34-ifoodfig-93033 …)

foodfight! is the most surreal movie ive ever experienced
@He11sing920 Want 2 truly outdo DW, please react 2 the movie Foodfight. You do't even have put it on the wishlist. It's on YouTube for free.
I have a physical aversion to the movie FOODFIGHT because it was the last movie I saw before I got a bad fever, so it was in my nightmares.
On a random note go watch foodfight its bad at first but the twist at the end is genius and improves the whole movie
Oh yeah don't watch foodfight. It is an awful movie and I feel bad for @JonTronShow for having to watch it.
Did you get movie sign? Foodfight MiSTing in a half-hour in the theater; http://www.livestream.com/charliesheendog  for the awful, awful movie.
I want to watch a shitty movie tonight should it be snail movie or foodfight
Huh. So bad movie _Foodfight_ is streaming all day, every day at http://www.livestream.com/charliesheendog  for some reason.

@JonTronShow I saw your review of Foodfight, and I watched the movie, and I have to say you gave the movie too much credit. It's even WORSE
Foodfight is such a good movie. Even the title is a sign of it's greatness.
@BlueAlexander93 Except the animation actually looks pretty darn good in that movie, whereas Foodfight...didn't. At all.

Foodfight! is the best movie ever
"Food. Fight." - Charlie Sheen in the animated disaster movie Foodfight!
There is a character in "Foodfight!" named Sunshine Goodness. Seriously. This movie is mesmerizingly, astonishingly not sunshine goodness.
Continuing the "rare movie" trend today with the infamously troubled animated feature "Foodfight!"
"I vas just following orders!" -an actual line from a movie supposedly for children #FoodFight
I have a feeling that, like everything else in this movie, every line reading used was a first take and they "just went with it". #FoodFight
@PsychoDuck NO Foodfight never happened It's not a real movie I refuse to believe otherwise
@spookysleeves OH MY GOD foodfight is the movie/fever dream with the 3d charlie sheen dog who's dating hilary duff http://youtu.be/4APrSSvvK2g 
end-of-year movie lineup includes - foodfight - alpha and omega - noobz - delgo - oogieloves - hausu (palate cleanser) - and then anime
Foodfight is such a good movie...
during breakfast we watched jontron's vid of foodfight movie and when i saw punchy i yelled and almost threw the phone
Meanwhile at the @LabZeroGames office, everyone is standing behind @animoose's monitor watching the Foodfight movie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APrSSvvK2g …
Nobody working on this movie had even heard of "animation" before production started #FoodFight
Hillary Duff playing Charlie Sheen's love interest is beyond creepy. Can you even imagine that in a live-action movie? #FoodFight
Foodfight! is a lot like atomic radiation. even if you love it you kind of have to limit your intake of that movie to 1/6mos at LEAST
then i rewatched Foodfight! and the sensory struggle of sitting through that movie dulled me to all feelings about frankie muniz
I can't even take this movie. How did this possibly get made?! #Foodfight
Foodfight. Still a better movie than The Last Airbender.

Well after watching that @JonTronShow I never want to watch Foodfight. I also question how and why that "movie" cost 65 million to make
EVEN IF FOODFIGHT DIDNT GO THROUGH ALL THAT STUFF THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE MOVIE IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS AND WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
Moral in this movie: ugly people never win ★ Foodfight! — https://path.com/p/3ozvhY

Foodfight is really the platonic ideal of a bad animated movie. Looks bad, story is bad, humor is bad, bad celeb VAs... it's almost perfect.
Have this urge to do a bad animated movie review but (a)don't have the time or knowledge of podcasting & (b)don't wanna watch Foodfight.

Holy God the humans in this movie are the most atrocious looking creatures in the entire universe #foodfight
Christopher Loyd returns to make this movie standable #foodfight
Catgirl is not catgirl on her raisin box yet they made her a catgirl. I hate this movie. Also she looks dead inside #foodfight
Oh this is one of those movie with gags during the credits, THANKS MARVEL STUDIOS #foodfight
Jesus Christ, there is a 45-minute final epic battle in this UTTERLY RETARDED MOVIE ABOUT COMMERCIAL FOOD MASCOTS #FoodFight
Did.. Did they just rip off DEVO? DEVO ISN'T EVEN A MOVIE #FoodFight
If anyone actually watched this movie we would have Global Communism in our time. #foodfight
"The Undesireables!" "The Inferior Product!" THERE IS SO. MUCH. HOLOCAUST SHIT IN THE MOVIE ABOUT MAPLE SYRUP AND TUNA FISH LOGOS #FoodFight
For a movie that makes generic cheap knockoffs the bad guy, #FoodFight sure is cheaply made, standard, and pulls from superior sources.
there are nazis in this movie #foodfight
Literal "commodity fetishism". I want to show this movie to Marx. #foodfight
Fun fact: in the movie #FoodFight, 3 different people voice the main character, and 4 are credited for voicing his sidekick
Holy fucking shitballs. RT @Lowenaffchen: 2012 direct-to-video CGI movie "Foodfight"... Highly recommended http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EyxLj7M1eU …
Whoa, this movie is about established brands fighting an EEEVIL superior indie brand #foodfight
Holy shit, the entire Foodfight movie made it to Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=6EyxLj7M1eU …
I have now watched 2012 direct-to-video CGI movie "Foodfight" three times in the last two days. Highly recommended http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EyxLj7M1eU …
sure foodfight! is bad by movie standards but it's great by second life machinima standards
calling that page "The Art of Foodfight!" sounds like one of those glossy coffee-table books that get released alongside an animated movie
@ryansongs best movie ever. Now I have to go watch it... #foodfight
Why is my life like a movie?? #foodfight
@paulscheer please you gotta check out this movie for #HDTGM? "Foodfight!" starring Charlie Sheen. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EyxLj7M1eU&list=FLy_G1sqneVvvTu3o_dY753Q&index=3&feature=plpp_video … look up its history

oddball715: Foodfight! (by ROFLOLBBQ111) If anyone ever wanted to know what the worst movie ever was well thi… http://tmblr.co/ZxEm7yY8CZAI 
i think this Foodfight movie might actually be the worst movie ever. EVER.
does foodfight count as a 2012 movie?
@Spongey444 That's why I said Wreck-It Ralph was the movie Foodfight wished it could be. It's the same concept, but executed FAR better.
About to watch "Foodfight!". Corporate sponsorship: The movie: furry edition.
I felt like I was in a movie today lol #FoodFight
Foodfight! is the movie version of Sonic 2006
And then it ends. God that movie was absolute Torture! The only bits I like was I.M Meen & his silly walks. #foodfight
Wow I wasn't wrong about the #foodfight trailer. They must have completely re-made this movie or something.
What is I.M Meen doing in this movie? And why is he moving like a drunkard? #foodfight?
So the protagonist is a Furry Indiana Jones? Its like he shouldn't be in this movie. #foodfight.
There is a boner in his trousers gag in this movie. THE DOG GETS A BONER. THE ACTUAL FUCK. #foodfight
The best thing in this film so far are the food pun based classic movie posters. "Dial B for Burger" hahahahahah kill me. #foodfight
I've been in a funk since watching Foodfight last night. That "movie" has drained my motivation and will to live.
Ok the foodfight characters are clipping through their clothing/vehicles. This is an animated movie
http://sherlockspeare.tumblr.com/post/35337993406/thescienceofobsession-artistic-beauty … God. Need this movie. #FOODFIGHT
Foodfight! Oh god, this movie gave me confidence as a future animator. It was just SOOoOO BAD http://youtu.be/6EyxLj7M1eU 
@Cabel Foodfight! should really be inspiring to everyone trying to animate a movie Second Life.
Foodfight! movie trailer.. What..in the world? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uROQ9nplxIY … Looks like 90's video game animations. And the people in it? Just, what?
@terrilynn_w after seeing the movie the parent trap how do you not tie into the odd sloppy joe #foodfight #thebest
@paulscheer @MsJuneDiane - please do an episode of HDTGM about the movie 'Foodfight!' http://imdb.to/SJvmHH  #CharlieSheenAsADogtective
It's almost not worth the trouble to delve into, but this movie is PROFOUNDLY misogynistic. #FoodFight
There are extras in this movie that are not only the same model and texture, but doing the same synchonized loops. Will fading. #FoodFight
There's... um... a bit of product placement in this movie. #FoodFight http://twitpic.com/bapr1d 
So this movie is set in a grocery store, and there's a lot of "humor" in the product names. I'm partial to Cheasel Weasel. #FoodFight
@Spongey444 Wreck It Ralph is the movie Foodfight Desperately wishes it could be. There's licensed foods in Wreck It Ralph, too! Puns, even!
@Cabel RT @IconicSC: absolutely amazing movie trailer #foodfight http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uROQ9nplxIY&list=HL1352135758&feature=mh_lolz …
