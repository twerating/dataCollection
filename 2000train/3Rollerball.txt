Ok Rollerball is the best movie ever.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/2GOgx45Rs14?a  ROLLERBALL (1975) - Movie/Arrow Blu-ray Review

Rollerball is such a good movie Paul heymans commentary is gold
I should apologize for some of my tweets tonight, but c'mon, Roller Boogie, Rollerball, they're pretty much the same movie, yeah? #TCMParty
Rollerball could have benefited from a car chase like this movie could benefit from someone getting bludgeoned w/ a metal ball. #TCMParty
@markpapadakis their inspiration…movie…Rollerball, early 70s, James Caan :)
@TravisSBN i watched the movie Rollerball and agree with you

"Rollerball" (1975) is a profound movie (B) #AhiMovieReviews <nnknz4>
The movie is 40 years old. Rollerball, though, seems very much alive. Corporations/teams trying to rob people of their soul/individuality
@raftofwater OMG... #Rollerball (1975) .. classic movie!
Suddenly reminded of the movie rollerball.
Business and society in the coming decades http://bit.ly/1Qph9NN  Thought provoking - reminds me of the movie "Rollerball" with James Caan
I feel like I am watching the 70's movie Rollerball!!! #CavsCeltics #CAVSvsCELTICS #Cavs
Watching movie DVR'd last week: 1975's ROLLERBALL. This movie could not be made today. Too pro-individual, anti-collective. Even pro-life.

ROLLERBALL (1975) - Movie/Blu-ray Review https://youtu.be/2GOgx45Rs14 
'Rollerball' is my shit ! One of my all time favorite movie for sure.
Watching the movie "Rollerball" in class. I am crying. I cannot handle violence
Watching ROLLERBALL remake and I don't know...I'm just...this movie is blowing my mind. The 1st 20mins are excruciating, barely anything...
I get the sense that if Paul Heyman's first movie wasn't Rollerball he would have had a pretty great career.
Let's all take a moment to remember this excellent movie: "Rollerball" http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0246894/ …
James Caan in the original 'Rollerball' was about that life! No other sport fantasy movie was harder than Rollerball
I couldn't imagine sleeping with a 12 yr old boy. @ that age I thought Limp bizkit was the greatest band & Rollerball was a great movie.
We are inches away from the dystopian society depicted in the movie Rollerball. http://bit.ly/1D69VHo

@HeymanHustle is truly the main reason I will stop the movie rollerball
and though most folks probs won't acknowledge it Rollerball is an amazing sports movie, probably the best in the genre if you ask me

Rollerball is a weird movie and I wonder why LL Cool J wanted to be in it.
Rollerball on TV and I have to say, @HeymanHustle is the only good thing about that movie.

Rollerball is still a fucking incredible movie
The movie Rollerball taught me to keep my ass west of Germany. No need for me to go any farther east than that.
Why was Rollerball a movie, and why was Slipknot featured in it?
You can't even sit at the table of bad movie discussions until you've seen Chris Klein's "Rollerball".

Rollerball 2002 is not a complex movie. It's probably on the overly blunt side. Unless images of class solidarity don't make sense to you.
Very underated movie. But it glided over question of how world of autonomous corps would share power. RT @galen_leslie: Rollerball?

Sounds like a sample from original 70s "Rollerball" movie on this languid track on #6music at the moment
@realscientists Possibly my perception of roller derby has been unduly influenced by the movie, Rollerball ;-)
Rollerball (the original) is such a smart concept. It frames a "1984" plot within a sports movie beautifully. Plus, James Caan is the shit.
You're telling me rollerball was a remake? Who the hell decided to make that movie twice?
I'm watching a movie called RollerBall. #TheWorstMovieEver
I think the remake of Rollerball is the worst movie with a wrestling personality in it.

Rollerball (2002) is a terrible movie.
Well, no Rollerball on any service, but YouTube has the whole movie somehow? 240p but take what you can get I guess.

Is rollerball a good movie?
@tutticontenti YW. I would make ROLLERBALL a required movie 4 all Libs 2 watch. This 1, was made back in the 1970s. I think you'd enjoy it.
@tutticontenti Yes, I would suggest watching a movie called RollerBall. Although fiction, it portrayed futuristic America=Corporate Fascism.

What was the worst movie you've ever seen? — Rollerball (2002) http://4ms.me/fAMnlI
Saw Futuresport last night. Weird movie. Claims that Chelsea Clinton will be President in 2025. Movie looked like a mediocre Rollerball.
rollerball is officially the worst movie...EVER!
Why am I watching the movie rollerball? #bored
Rollerball was on TV so I started watching. Worst movie ever? How did McTiernan fall so far?

When they remake the movie Rollerball, all the stars will be wearing these Oregon uniforms. APPROVE!
Just finished watching the 1975 classic 'Rollerball'. James Caan's best movie.

Good morning. Watching "Rollerball". I love this movie!
@DMTintheCity Movie was "Rollerball". We had more fun watching you wipe out into a bush in the parking lot in front of a terrified family.
@IanSowers Deep Blue Sea is still a favourite of mine. And to his credit, he has never made a movie half as bad as McTiernan's Rollerball.
The Imitation of Life is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. Rollerball was better than this.
In 1977 I created a game inspired by the movie Rollerball. It went over like a lead balloon. Some are saying I should republish it now.
What is this *garbage* of a movie called "Rollerball" ?
I can't decide what's worse. That the movie #rollerball was ever made or that I sat through the whole thing and didn't hate it...
Watching Rollerball, best bad movie of all time, handicam night vision and all
You know, I think Rollerball (2002) is meant as the ultimate tribute movie - its bad in all the places that the original was good.
When Chris Klein's acting isn't the worst thing about a movie, you know it's one of the biggest cinematic turds of all time. #rollerball
This rollerball movie is strange! Enjoying it though!
My god, Rollerball is just an atrocious movie.

@heliumcell Oh man, The Warriors! I almost forgot about that movie. You wear that, and I'll wear a Rollerball costume. We'll rule!
@DrDichotomy We're heading to a world just like Rollerball '75 and it's scary how prescient that movie was.
I watched the Rollerball (1975) movie the other night. Gee it was good. James Caan was amazing.
@DrBobParsons hmm convict football sounds like a movie...like a twist on the longest yard meets rollerball sounds like he is drunk.

@StarchildCoop oh yeah! Based on that, never watch the movie 'rollerball'
Sitting here Watching James Caan, "Rollerball" awesome movie too bad the remake sucked and reading "Hex and the City " By Simon Green
Watching Rollerball while my hair color sets. & no, not the crappy Chris Klein/LL Cool J one... The 70's B-movie one with James Caan! LOL
I mean, I'm looking forward to the rest of the book, too, but the movie could be amazing. Like the original Rollerball.
