Just ordered the complete Harry Potter movie set on blu-ray while watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on ABC Family
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone should be considered a Christmas movie! #Christmas #HarryPotter #classic #whereismyletter
HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE IS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE AHH
I made the executive decision that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a Christmas movie so now i will be jolly if it kills me
I don't get why ABC Family considers Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone a Christmas movie. The Christmas part is like, 6-7 minutes max.
