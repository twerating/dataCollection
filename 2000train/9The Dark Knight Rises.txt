The Dark Knight Rises is a really depressing movie. It's not even dark, it's nihilistic.
It's movie night at our house. What would be better to watch - Django Unchained or The Dark Knight Rises? Haven't seen either!

Cause it's a black movie. But the dark knight rises and trainwreck was in theaters and there's wax theater shooting by white people.
The most notorious movie theater shooting happened at a showing off The Dark Knight Rises. Batman. A comic book superhero. Think about that.
#LRT It'd be funny if it wasn't infuriating. Trainwreck wasn't an ~urban movie. Nor The Dark Knight rises. And neither shooter was Black.

Nah. The ending was terrible RT @SB_TrapMogul: I try to act like The Dark Knight Rises didn't happen. That movie was horrible.
@2vidguy @Lokay Yea I think we put up with stuff if it's The Dark Knight Rises, but we all knew that movie would be horrible right away
Watching @AmazonUK Prime movie (The Dark Knight Rises) and the soundtrack is hilariously out of sync with the video.
Batman the dark Knight rises is my favorite movie , swear I could watch this over and over and not get tired of it !

Ultimately, though, which is the better movie? "The Dark Knight Rises" or "Trainwreck"?
Every time I watch The Dark Knight Rises, it makes me wish they would make another Batman movie so bad! Come on Hollywood!
The Dark Knight Rises is a great movie

Sucks to have your movie tied to a mass shooting. Every time I watch The Dark Knight Rises I always wonder which part the CO shooter started
Wasn't there a shooting in Colorado at a movie theater a few years ago, some crazy nut ruined the dark knight rises for some people

the dark knight rises is seriously the best movie in the batman series
Watching the Dark Knight Rises thinking about how I was JUST in Hollywood where I saw the cars and suits he wore in the movie
THE ENDING OF THE DARK KNIGHT RISES WILL FOREVER BE HANDS DOWN THE BEST ENDING TO A MOVIE EVERRRRRRRR OMFG
@YaboyJiggleClay @mellow_saa I love the Dark Knight Rises man, I love every super hero movie that drops. That trilogy=
Still waiting for Warner Bros. to follow up The Dark Knight Rises with a movie about Robin.
The ending of the dark knight rises is still one of the best endings to a movie that I've seen
The Dark Knight Rises is like the BEST movie ever.
Watching the dark knight rises and loving it. Am I the only one that wants another Chris Nolan Batman movie ?
The Dark Knight Rises: favorite movie of all time
@efe312199c5e492 Which movie I'm watching The Dark Knight Rises
Watching a movie with the hubby and it went to commercials and the announcer says " the dark knight rises brought to you by viagra"
the dark knight rises is the greatest movie ever
Boy the dark knight rises is such a good movie
It is ironic that the movie I'm watching rn is "brought to you by Viagra" and that movie just so happens to be the dark knight rises
"Tell me where the trigger is... Then, you have my permission to die." -The Dark Knight Rises One of the best movie lines of all time.
Also, the EPIC fight scene on Wall Street in The Dark Knight Rises with 10,000 people. So incredible to have made a movie on this scale.
only superhero movie I can watch is the dark knight rises
The Dark Knight is not only the best Batman movie, but an all-time great film. With that said, The Dark Knight Rises is very underrated
The Dark Knight Rises is such an unreal movie

No movie ever highlighted that the police are the guardians of the rich like The Dark Knight Rises
Suicide Squad is the first comic book movie I've been properly excited about since The Dark Knight Rises.
You know what, I hate the Dark Knight Rises for several reasons. But I take back what I said about it being impossible to make that movie--

Why is The Dark Knight Rises the most entertaining movie to repeat dialogue to. Between Batman and Bane, way too much fun.

I wonder if that bozo who shot up the theater during the first showing of *The Dark Knight Rises* has seen the whole movie yet.
The Dark Knight Rises always give me chills & I demand another movie dammit. It has been TOO LONG.
Opening scene of The Dark Knight Rises where Bane crashes the plane is still my all time favorite movie scene
#MakeAMoviePainful: The Dark Knight Rises. Hell there's nothing more to say about it, that movie's painful enough.
Don't know if I've been this excited for a movie since Interstellar; maybe even The Dark Knight Rises.
The last time I felt this excited when about to watch a movie is maybe when The Dark Knight Rises played! #JurassicWorld

more recent example: the stills of anne hathaway in the dark knight rises promos looked awful. she was the best thing about that movie.
I honestly think that The Dark Knight Rises is my favorite full-length movie ever
The best single superhero movie I've seen is Batman..Batman begins, the dark knight & the dark knight rises. All classics! The villains too
what is perfection? when the dark knight rises's sequel is a Robin movie and then continued with another Dark knight movie
How much greater would The Dark Knight Rises been had Heath been alive to make the movie :(
But like the film The Dark Knight Rises, after a strong start the movie veered off into disaster alley. Lil Wayne? Kanye? CHRIS BROWN?!
"The Dark Knight Rises" is the best movie of all time
the best song from the dark knight rises score wasnt even in the movie what a shame
@hellothmushroom I feel the same about the Dark Knight Rises. Thank God I watched the Lego Movie right after, Lego Batman was way cooler.
To this day I still feel like they should've made The Dark Knight Rises into two movies after the Bane fight the movie felt rushed

The Dark Knight Rises is a pretty straight-forward movie but so much of it goes over everyone's head for reasons still unclear to me.

IMO The Dark Knight Rises is a more interesting movie since I started watching Gotham. Explains a few things I didn't fully get.
I really ship Catwoman & Batman <33 The Dark Knight Rises is always the perfect movie to watch at night! Omg, I love it!
Sometimes The Dark Knight Rises is a really fun movie but then Bruce Wayne puts on a magic knee brace and can suddenly kick through walls.
The Dark Knight Rises is showing, this movie never gets old!!
“@mtnasielski: New fave movie = the dark knight rises” realist thing I've ever heard
The Dark Knight Rises. Best Batman Movie Ever
just re watched "the dark knight rises" and peeped robin was in the movie
"The movie. It was a lifetime long. It was so fucking long." - my review of The Dark Knight Rises
Just got eyeballs on the entirety of The Dark Knight Rises. Easily the worst Batman movie from Nolan.
All In the movie "the dark knight rises" like I ain't seen it 45 times smh
The ending of The Dark Knight Rises has to be one of the greatest movie endings of all time #Truth
The last scene in The Dark Knight Rises is one of, if not THE, best scenes to end a movie series… ever.
The Dark Knight Rises will always have one of the greatest endings to a movie, ever.
no movie has ever ended better than the way the dark knight rises did
I still don't understand the ending of The Dark Knight Rises but I love the movie so much.
The Dark Knight Rises ending is fantastic. Love that movie.

I say this about every movie but I should've been in The Dark Knight Rises

One of my favorite movie moments: Bruce Wayne making the jump without the rope in The Dark Knight Rises. Music swells. Bats flying. *tear*
The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises will forever be in my top 10 favorite movie list.

Forgot how great of a movie batman the dark knight rises is
I'm sorry but I just don't see how The Dark Knight Rises is a bad movie
@ZeroReax Me too!! Seen that movie! Prefer the Dark Knight Rises better!! :)
I swear, fifteen minutes of the Dark Knight Rises is dedicated to a Matthew Modine subplot. His character has no bearing on the movie.
@Red_devil3212 @RagnhildStenvik The Dark Knight Rises is my fav Batman movie
The Dark Knight Rises is honestly the perfect movie.
The Dark Knight Rises is so good, purely because of the supporting cast. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anne Hathaway are gold in this movie.

Batman supposedly "died" at the end of the Dark Knight Rises. "Robin" went to the bat cave so we need a Robin movie.

How would you make The Dark Knight Rises if Heath Ledger was alive to play the Joker? It would be an awesome movie!! http://www.quora.com/How-would-you-make-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-if-Heath-Ledger-was-alive-to-play-the-Joker/answer/Ken-Miyamoto …
the dark knight rises is a rocky movie
I wish Nolan made another Batman movie between The Dark Knight & Rises. I woulda loved to see what he'd do with The Riddler & Penguin.
