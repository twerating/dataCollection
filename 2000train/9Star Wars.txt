I don't enjoy the "argue over the internet" thing. But when you bring movie theatres during Star Wars into the mix I can't stop myself.
My daughter would rather see the TIna Fey, Amy Poehler movie on opening day rather than Star Wars which also opens then. Okay.
To make sure the new Star Wars movie is good, I'm watching all the prequels and the Holiday Special right before I head to the theater.
Can't believe the new Star Wars movie is almost out. I'm going to the midnight release to watch nerds cream their pants.
I'm bold but I doubt I'm "choosing to release the third Chipmunks movie on the same day as Star Wars" bold.

Lowkey trying to go see this new Star Wars movie
Now the real question... who's dressing up star wars themed to work / school on release day and to the movie? ;P
@ditzkoff There's a new star wars movie? Hadn't heard. Is Lucas directing? And hey, did they make a trailer?
The fact that the most recent Star Wars movie came out 10 years ago is absolutely nuts and I feel old.
