So excited for stonewall movie
If you did all of these things, that would mean that you were FOUR TIMES MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN @Stonewall_Movie WAS. (4/4)
I am obsessed with how hard @Stonewall_Movie flopped.
Finally a Caleb Landry Jones movie (not called Stonewall) that will see the light of day https://twitter.com/ThePlaylist/status/677488180807917568 …
... and just about as exciting, too. I walked out of that movie. Boring! @Fiddlguru @LindaSuhler
i hate the man who directed Stonewall. I'm so glad that movie failed
@BlissTabitha @Stonewall_77 the NWO uses religion for Divide and conquer and its working see this https://youtu.be/JdJIeioamd8 
all i can hope is that the movie bombs as hard as stonewall
It was after my time, but that Stonewall movie was #UtterNonsense
When I watched the trailer for #IndependenceDayResurgence I thought it was an instant remake of Emmerich's @Stonewall_Movie
And do we really trust the guy who made Godzilla '98, Stonewall, and the Shakespeare Trutherism movie anymore?
im still pissed about the stonewall movie like you cant just do that
After that Stonewall movie I'm afraid Roland Emmerich won't be able to tell the story of the second invasion of Earth as it really happened.
How to improve that mess of a whitewash movie known as Stonewall: making Spike Lee the director of it.
@BlakeGoble @guyneiljames @MGGBZ @dsuzannemayer Remember how they let him make a movie about Stonewall? lol
@maddigzlz I feel like you should have a yearly series about the movie I hate the most that year. Danish Girl or Stonewall could work well.

Remember when we boycotted @Stonewall_Movie and called it out on its racism and erasure and then it premiered and lost like millions of $
Did the casting director of American Horror Story see the white washed Stonewall movie and be like 'this it, these are my wonder bread boys'
I'm still upset that the stonewall movie is so whitewashed and erases trans identity, it's such a missed opportunity.
I fear even young queers won't understand why the Stonewall movie is a travesty; acceptance clouds revisionist history.
Remember that hella problematic Stonewall movie? It has 9% on Rotten Tomatoes & made $175,000 at the box office. Yes, 175 THOUSAND. #blessed
On a totally unrelated note I just saw the poster for the infamous Stonewall movie and it looks awesomely like it should be for RENT

My Review of Stonewall the Movie http://fb.me/6MDgxD7Ln 
THE JAPANESE LIVE ACTION DEATH NOTE MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE, THE WHITEWASHED ONE WILL BE EVEN WORSE. I HOPE IT DOES WORSE THAN STONEWALL. WTF
@SouthernHomo @J0ELN0LE the stonewall movie deserves .1/5 stars
WHY ARE THEY WHITE WASHING THE MOVIE STONEWALL !!!! THATS NOT RIGHT
I'm happy the stonewall movie bombed smh that's what you dicks get for whitewashing the hell out of history
oh no... the director of stonewall said straight folks would related to the protagonist of the movie cuz he's straight acting...
I just learned that the movie Stonewall had a budget of 17 million dollars and made less than 200 thousand and I have not stopped smiling

Stonewall was the hangout for marginalized TBLG people, & any movie not centered on that reality deserves to die a painful box office death.
Im not saying I judge you if you liked Stonewall the movie, i'm just saying your number got deleted out of my phone by itself.
The Stonewall riots were not a planned Fire Island gay male rebellion as the movie tried to paint it.
The whitewashed 'Stonewall' movie tanked. As the child & godchild of historians so happy to hear that.
So I've given it a lot of thought and I've yet to hear a good word about the Stonewall movie. So I'm not going to watch it.

Well, we successfully killed the Stonewall movie. $112,414 opening weekend averaging $871 per screen. I think Emmerich got the message.
Here's to hoping that someone will make a historically accurate Stonewall movie. It's a story that needs to be told, not changed.

Stonewall movie = epic fail Disposition = Hated it
The movie, #Stonewall, tanked at the box office like most of us suspected. Terrible reviews and made minimal money.

I hope what Hollywood learns from the failed STONEWALL movie isn't that viewers don't want gay films, but that they want HONEST gay films.
People are glad that the Hollywood-whitewashed stonewall movie failed at box offices

Do you now have an idea of why the Stonewall movie tanking is a good thing? If you need more reasons, look up ANY review. Literally any one.
Thankfully, the ridiculous train wreck of historical events/representation that is the new Stonewall movie seriously tanked this weekend.
So happy to hear that the Stonewall movie bombed. That seems well deserved. Now can someone make a more accurate version of it?

Roland Emmerich directing a Stonewall movie makes about as much sense as Michael Bay directing a movie about Pearl Harbor Wait.
I wouldn't know Stonewall was a movie if it wasn't for people being mad at it.

Basically the @Stonewall_Movie is for racist white people who want to seem "open-minded" when they're really not, just like the director
Is that 'Stonewall' movie a, you know, what's the word, a joke?

People are calling for a boycott of this #Stonewall movie because of its historical inaccuracy, but it didn't look interesting to me anyway.
Looks like @Stonewall_Movie won't be opening in my area. Not sure if that's a bad thing. Reviews are awful.
2015 will go down as the year where the Stonewall movie was more disrespectful to historical accuracy than a 3D Peanuts movie.
I'll probably hire @TyleKurner and @bybowes to work on my Stonewall movie in about 10 years. We'll do it proper.

I can't believe Kermit the Frog's new girlfriend Denise throws the brick in the Stonewall movie.
In @Stonewall_Movie , the talented Jonny Beauchamp goes from "Penny Dreadful" to just plain "Dreadful!" #stilloutatthemovies @TheDailyShow
Stonewall actually looks like it would be a good movie if it told the story how it actually happened
Apparently that Stonewall movie is about how a beautiful white boy started the gay rights movement. Yikes. http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
@Stonewall_Movie critics are dragging the film and it's being boycotted
@Stonewall_Movie ummm your movie is getting ripped to shreds

@Stonewall_Movie @rolandemmerich the nerve to fucking name drop her like this?! You should absolutely be ashamed of yourselves. Unbelievable
@Stonewall_Movie @rolandemmerich You rewrite the entire history of Stonewall to dismiss/minimize the roles of people like Marsha & then have
If you gotta see the stonewall movie, buy a different movie ticket, preferably something not whitewashing history, and then sneak in. Easy!

Having just seen the movie #Stonewall, I'm reminded of my favorite John Waters quote: "I may be gay but I ain't this."
Idea. Go to where @Stonewall_Movie is playing and blast the @HamiltonMusical cast recording over the film's dialogue. #Outraged
SO......has the "Stonewall" movie already made the full pivot to cult classic?
Please do not go see the Stonewall movie, it is incredibly whitewashed and offensive to LGBT people of color. #BoycottStonewall
A scathing, important review of the terribly misconstructed depictions of the Stonewall Riots in the movie #Stonewall http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
Could someone tell me if the Stonewall movie is any good because I can't find any reviews anywhere. pic.twitter.com/VA5Y5MMUEt
Ouch! This Vanity Fair review of the Stonewall movie.... http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …

@MSNBCPR @rolandemmerich @OhAbit @JonnyBeauchamp @Morning_Joe @Stonewall_Movie Bullshit Movie this movie is a blatant lie
Reviewers have seen the whole movie and...Stonewall Is Terribly Offensive, and Offensively Terrible http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich … via @VanityFair
people surprised that Stonewall is a bad movie should have read the director’s filmography first
Read @rilaws' review of the cis, male, & whitewashing film Stonewall, @rolandemmerich's biggest disaster movie yet http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …

The reviews of Stonewall movie are even worse than I imagined: "terribly offensive and offensively terrible". http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
@dipIomats_son they covered the stonewall movie and were like "well all the changes are a bummer but ya gotta support it cause ~solidarity~"
@MattBaume I prefer the earlier Stonewall movie where the riot scene turned into a musical number. Talk about #Camp!
" @Stonewall_Movie is a racist transphobic shit". Sounds accurate to me.
Stonewall seems like the kind of movie with at least two scenes where trans/gender-nonconforming person removes their wig out of "respect."
. @Stonewall_Movie is exploiting and appropriating the image of Marsha P. Johnson for advertising. We cannot let this stand. #NotOurStonewall
I love negative movie reviews. And Stonewall's reviews have been very, very bad. pic.twitter.com/6Ly3iDtgjd

"Looking for a Definitive Stonewall Movie"
I kinda want to hate-watch that wildly inaccurate Stonewall movie
Also fuck that new stonewall movie
Huge surprise the new Stonewall movie is not just offensive it's laughably awful. :/ http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich … http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/tiff-review-roland-emmerichs-gay-rights-drama-stonewall-20150919 …
Who woulda thunk the man 'behind' Independence Day & Stargate woulda made such a fistula of a movie about Stonewall? http://www.marksimpson.com/blog/2009/08/21/bottoms-from-outer-space/ …
Wow. Reviews of @stonewall_movie are pouring in and they say it is AWFUL. Worse than the trailer. #notourstonewall #donateaticket
So the Stonewall movie we all said would be trash ends up being trash. Surprise!
"It should be called Independence Gay." An effective & no doubt deserved savaging of the terrible Stonewall movie: http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
So there's a movie about women's suffrage coming out that features exactly no women of color? Typical. Stonewall all over again.
In which @VanityFair eviscerates @Stonewall_Movie in a review & confirms our worst suspicions about its #whitewash https://twitter.com/VanityFair/status/646355795634954240 …
So it seems the Stonewall movie is getting panned by critics and audiences alike. We called this ages ago when the trailer came out.
@VanityFair support @hbdmarsha a movie about stonewall made by queers and qtpoc!
hey heres a great article about the stonewall movie http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich … #BoycottStonewall

Utter evisceration of the Stonewall movie here; fairly sure I'll be giving it a miss, I think. http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
You lose the right to criticize the Stonewall movie if your LGBT social circles are filled with white male protagonists.
I swear I can hear the sound of everyone involved in the Stonewall Movie editing it off their IMDB profiles.
Any hope that STONEWALL movie wasn’t as bad as the trailer. http://img.gifmagazine.net/gifmagazine/images/530718/original.gif?1439806321 …

@pourthethistle like, a stonewall movie done right could've been amazing

Oh, the Stonewall movie is out this weekend. Oh no.
They should just can that Stonewall movie. Everybody in it gone suffer because of if.

he cast a black dude in a movie once, so it's ok he made a fictional white dude the center of the stonewall riots https://twitter.com/benjamintown/status/646362362841313280 …
Stonewall movie is racist, slut shaming, stereotyped, transphobic, hides lesbians & is anti-gay. Worked out about as well as expected...

@AdamSerwer @Mowgli3 Because I am forever indebted to the brave souls of Stonewall, I'll never see the movie. Invisibility=Death
I wonder what in Roland Emmerich's career made a studio think, "THIS is the guy to make a movie about Stonewall."
. @Stonewall_Movie is worse than we thought "how long until someone throws a brick through the screen?" #PleaseMary http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
"Stonewall is terribly offensive and offensively terrible" This is the type of movie review that I like to see

When is anyone gonna get the events and heroes of Stonewall portrayed accurately? Because this movie failed horribly. http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
i want a special in-theater event where Jujubee and the cattiest queens she can gather read that new Stonewall movie for filth
@ZachStafford @Stonewall_Movie I'd like this movie to go away now. pic.twitter.com/CDwslkd9hU
@cheprin commentary on that would be nice but why is any of that in this movie? It's not even a biopic about stonewall lmao

@shocklidge @Stonewall_Movie Kind of concerned that heteronormativity manages to slip itself into a movie that should be opposing it..
this is an amazing takedown of what I assume is probably a really horrifically bad movie about stonewall http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
From @AZEALIABANKS to @Stonewall_Movie I'm so disappointed in our appointed representation! Don't let celebrity represent you!

did this prediction come true re: Stonewall movie https://twitter.com/fussybabybitch/status/616750796223295489 …
Is there seriously a subplot in the Stonewall movie where the cute white boy can't get over his upbringing and love the fem blatino
The upcoming movie dramatization of the 1969 Stonewall riots is terribly offensive, and offensively terrible http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
I will gladly help picket any theater in NOLA area stupid enough to show the awful Stonewall travesty movie. Who's in?

Stonewall is a masc-on-masc disaster movie, makes "Christopher Street look like Sesame Street": http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/stonewall-review-roland-emmerich …
Early STONEWALL reacts sound more like anger at what movie didn't get made than reviews of the movie that did. I'll find out in a lil bit.
The stargate reboot annoys me, but what really makes me hate Roland Emmerich is the Stonewall movie.
