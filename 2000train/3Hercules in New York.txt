This is the second worst man vs bear fight I've ever seen in a movie. The first will always be HERCULES IN NEW YORK with Schwarzenegger.
@natazilla Nat, Hercules in New York is a pretty great bad movie. It's on Netflix now. Stars Arnold when he was called Arnold Strong.
@sknthla His first movie, Hercules in New York, is comically bad. They overdubbed his voice, for example.

Hercules in New York really does beg the question how did this get made? @HDTGM Please talk about who green lit this movie.
I sometimes wonder if I like the THOR movie more than most people because it's like HERCULES IN NEW YORK with a budget.

Watching Hercules in New York. Arnold "Strong" was a terrible actor, as was every other actor and actress in this movie.

@Wossy Batman Forever? nonsense! Hercules In New York is the greatest movie ever made.
According to the movie Hercules in New York bears fight with their shoes on and they punch you in the kidneys.
- Ahnold's 1st movie, Hercules in New York, is ridiculously craptastic. If you ever get the chance, watch it. :P Anyway goodnight.
watching arnold schwarzenegger killing it in hercules in new york. literally, killing it. this movie is so bad it's oscar worthy.
