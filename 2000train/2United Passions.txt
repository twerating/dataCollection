@PachiPortrait @ANNZac The worst movie was United Passions - a modern day propaganda film.

My review of United Passions, the #FIFA movie. It was not great, but also AMAZING http://www.mistercinecal.com/2014/11/2014-catch-up-united-passions-fifa-movie_28.html …
About to watch FIFA movie, United Passions. Expect it to be as on-the-level and even-handed as all things written about FIFA by FIFA.
I really want to see United Passions. How long do I have to wait before it's on Movie Mix? Is it part of the Christmas line up??

Alright, got United Passions in and about ready to hit play. I assure you, this is a movie about FIFA and not a porno set at the UN.
Movie suggestion, you ask? Check out United Passions feat. Sepp Blatter as the hero who brings soccer to all! FIFA spent £16m on this comedy

#sportsbiz budget for that awful FIFA "movie" "United Passions" was £16m, more than was given to Interpol for #intergrity anti- #matchfixing
Would much rather see a movie about the FBI's FIFA investigation than United Passions.
@russty_russ @transdiffusion I wish "The UK Gold Movie" was a self-commissioned docudrama akin to FIFA's 'United Passions'.

I've honestly never wanted to sneak a camcorder into a theater to illegally record a movie as badly as I have with #FIFA's "United Passions"
So I'm disappointed #FIFA's movie "United Passions" hasn't been picked up by any theaters in the US.
"United Passions" movie funded with $27 million of FIFA money promises to be total failure. http://foxs.pt/1t00gjN  pic.twitter.com/erEVXIze4y
So I'm guessing that "United Passions", the movie about FIFA, portrays Blatter for what he is: a flop. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bda29558acdd41ba89cb028adff7daca/fifas-27-million-world-cup-film-fails-inspire …
ZURICH: Funded with $27 million of FIFA money, World Cup film fails to inspire in the movie "United Passions". http://www.mail.com/int/entertainment/lifestyle/3136826-fifas-27-world-cup-film-fails-to-inspire.html …
"United Passions", the movie about FIFA that cost $27m to make, has earned $200k. So that's reallly terrible. http://bit.ly/1s0N2RF 
FIFA paid more to make United Passions (a terrible movie about itself) than it would cost to lay grass for the WWC.
Am I the only person that has watched FIFA's movie, United Passions? Or is everyone else too ashamed to admit it?
Spending a Friday night in watching the FIFA movie 'United Passions', described by @AAndrewJennings as 'the worst film ever.'
FIFA corruption getting you down? Surely their movie doesn't turn away from it? Review: United Passions http://wp.me/pV3GT-1Vo  via @NFBblog
The United Passions movie about @FIFAcom so cringeworthy. Anyone who pays to see it should automatically be allowed a re-fund.
@uersfeld reminds me of line spoken by "adi dassler" in hilarious FIFA-movie "united passions"
@FIFAcom the movie united passions is probably the best football movie production I have ever watched Inspiring

United Passions movie-liked. Plus it was funny to see the (wannabe) celebrities' parade on the premier.
United Passions OST by Jean-Pascal Beintus is worth listening to. Made me to look up the movie. The movie is apparently horrible propaganda.
@United_Passions amazing is Gerard Depardieu on twitter? Is it to promote the movie?
Hey @United_Passions when is the UK release date for your brilliant FIFA movie - I seriously can't wait.

Extended advert now for the movie United Passions, the 23m euros Fifa vanity project starring Tim Roth. God, it looks bad.
FIFA spent $27million on its Goal development program, the same it spent on its United Passions movie
Blatter also plugged the new FIFA history movie "United Passions". Might wait for that on Netflix.
Blatter: "We have to protect the spirit of the original 7 pioneers. They are recorded in 'United Passions'" (Movie funded by Fifa's $16m)
Blatter plugs FIFA 23 million movie United Passions - Haven't seen signs of it hitting the cinemas in Brazil
Tim Roth in cracking form currently: playing Sepp Blatter in the FIFA circle jerk movie 'United Passions', and starring in Grace of Monaco.

The FIFA United Passions movie project was part funded by Azerbaijan. It just parodies itself.
I really want to rubberneck the car crash that the FIFA vanity project, sorry movie, United Passions will be. 25m dollars to make apparently
