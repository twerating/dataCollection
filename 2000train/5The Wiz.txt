Sorry. "The Wiz" (movie) was just on Aspire and I spent the entire time remixing the music into filth.
The overture from the Wiz (the movie version) is always

The Wiz is a stupid movie. The songs are good but the idea for this movie is just ludicrous. On top of that, it ruined The Wizard Of Oz.
Mkay I watched The Wiz movie again. It's still pretty bad. With some really good moments. Diana Ross' performance is bizarre.
The wiz was never ever made for white folks. Sorry. That's why you had the Wizard of oz. you know the movie with no black folks.

@PMorris153 @iamrashidajones The back of the jacket literally says "The Wiz The Movie!" :)
Why is everyone mad about The Wiz as if it's new? The movie literally came out in the 1970s lmao
The Wiz is like, the second time David Alan Grier and Queen Latifah have been in The Wizard of Oz, because of that Muppet movie.
Yet ppl were mad about the wiz RT @MelechT: A movie called "Gods of Egypt" starring nothing but White people. This is just insulting by now.
@LoganCrocker2 the Wiz came out as a movie in the 70s with an original cast including Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. #TheMoreYouKnow

Still dont understand how people are mad "The Wiz" has an all black cast when the original movie was...........nevermind
Watching "The Wiz" from NBC last night. Did anyone else mention how this was 10000% better than that movie? Cuz it is. No doubt.
The music from the wiz movie was so much better. I think its because of the harmonica. People be sleeping on that instrument its so majestic
@AwwHELLToTheNaw the movie The Wiz with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson was the name. This is Live, its a Musical. So it is different.
@GaziKodzo I also grew up to The Wiz. I never saw the play but fell in love with the movie. Micheal and Diana was perfect together.
The Wizard of oz is my fav movie of all time but I fw the wiz too
So, I've never seen the movie version of The Wiz, but I enjoyed last night's #TheWizLive more than the original Wizard of Oz.

That. Cause I def heard someone call the movie the original version of the wiz
Moment of transparency. I did not watch The Wiz last night...or the original movie. And yes, I am still black the last time I checked
@queseryto I was explaining the concept & the Wiz Movie. He'd never heard of Diana Ross! I can't tell you how shocked I was. #GenerationGap
I need for @ravensymone and @TheView to understand there was a Broadway version of The Wiz prior to movie being released. Not a redo of film
@DGUNZ22 Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It was operator error. AFN will re-air the The Wiz Live on Sat at 10pm on AFN|movie.
OOooo! The Wiz Live isn't what I thought it was going to be. Guess u can't judge a movie by its title. *Relinquishes my black card*
The Wiz (The Movie); The Wiz (Live) the cast is suppose to be black stop trying to take the shine away us pic.twitter.com/jJ6MbKghOU

@TheView I believe the Wiz was musical in theater before it was a movie in the 70s. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiz  #TheView
@ravensymone Diana, Michael, etc weren't the originals. Last night was based on the Broadway The Wiz, which came before the movie. @TheView
@TheView The Wiz was a play from the beginning. The movie was based on the play. Last night NBC showed The Wiz, the play not The Wiz movie.
Raven-Symone, remember that the original The Wiz was a stage production, not the movie with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. @TheView
hey @ravensymone the movie The Wiz was based on the play, so Diana and Michael did not originate those roles, Stephanie Mills did #TheView
Why are ppl specifying The Wiz: Live as "all black"? That's not necessary. It's implied if you even know what The Wiz movie is.
is The Wiz a movie or a musical on stage? and why are TW fans hating on Wicked....shut up
Bruh keep the "The Wiz" movie to the black people frfr
I don't think the Wiz last night was based off the movie. I think more so off the play.

I don't think people understand that the Wiz Live was a play and not a movie and maybe it wasn't for our generation but more for the kids
Whites that cried about the NBC play of "The Wiz" being all black has never seen it. Stephanie Mills or Diana Ross movie. None sense a work
Why are ppl being so weird about The Wiz having an All Black cast... Isn't the movie a Black version of The Wizard Of Oz... Do they not know
If your complaint is the Wiz wasn't like the movie you clearly need to step outside and go see a STAGE play. #shetitup #culture #yep
In nostalgic form, one of my favorite movies as a child, I loved this song from the classic movie "The Wiz" So... http://fb.me/2hjcZykEZ 
"The wiz live was racist for an all black cast" ???? if you've seen the movie you would know that's how it's supposed to be.
White people wanna be oppressed SO BAD! There is an all white The Wiz, that movie is called The Wizard of Oz. LET US BE GREAT
how can you complain that there should be an all White version to the movie "The Wiz" ? NIGGA IT IS! IT'S CALLED "The Wizard of Oz"!!!!
Gonna pick pop up , get some pizza watch the wiz and his Thomas the train movie
I didn't watch the wiz last night,but I did watch Home. It was such a good movie pic.twitter.com/CLs8pMNq8B
Woke up today still thinking "The Wiz" was ass...all that hype...woulda been better as a movie instead of that live bullshit
The Wiz has been around for decades. A Broadway show that Stephanie Mills slayed, a movie where DIANA ROSS was Dorothy
Man, I looooved The Wiz when I was a kid. Think I saw it before, and more often than, the original Wizard of Oz movie.
how is The Wiz racist because it has an all black cast? The other movie was all white.... Lol when the book version has different races.
When Niya wakes up I'm gonna see if I can get her to watch the Wiz. Movie or the live TV event.
I rode a bike to bay plaza wit my boy Dblock back in da days to buy Streets is watchin movie on VHS.n I bought it from Nobody beats the Wiz
Looks like FB complained that The Wiz wasn't like the movie last night LOL! So glad I have Twitter
And The Wiz was initially portrayed as a Broadway musical based on the book and told the store in an urban way? The movie came later
everyone is complaining about how the wiz is racist account towards caucasians, when the original movie had an all caucasian cast....
@teiganish not comparable. This was Shanice's first performance and it wasn't the movie, The Wiz, it was based on the original Broadway show
The WIZ • Movie/Broadway/Live on TV and so the culture continues • Last nights Live on TV… https://www.instagram.com/p/-30MjoCanI/ 
#DearWhitePeople If the remake of the all black 70's movie The Wiz by an all black cast upset you, you seriously need to get help & a life
The Wizard of Oz was a great book, movie, and manifestation of white culture but The Wiz added flavor to it.
I don't understand why ppl are so outraged at 'The Wiz' like this movie hasn't been out since 1978.
But the wiz is a black remake to a white movie why would the characters be any other race
Really my last rant on the Wiz. The original play won 7 Tony Awards, critically acclaimed. The movie FLOPPED!!... http://fb.me/SS1r4L49 
I see comparisons between The Wiz Live and The Wizard Of Oz only as one is a play the other a movie. It's not a fair comparison I love both!
People are so hateful! People are upset that The Wiz was an all black cast...BASED OFF AN ALL WHITE MOVIE! but I guess they forgot.
I was never a big fan of The Wiz Movie... But the play is dope! I'm happy for all those who enjoyed it and are excited about the rehash.
He had never even heard of the wiz , the 1978 African American soulful movie starring Diana Ross , Michael Jackson & Richard Pryor
I hate that "ppl" had a issue with the cast of The Wiz...the original play & the original movie had an all AFRICAN AMERICAN CAST! #TheWiz
Kids are reporting back about The Wiz. They're upset it wasn't a movie and didn't understand why they were singing so much.
STILL, PPL CONFUSING THE WIZ MOVIE WITH THE PLAY!!!!! Stop it. #NewsOneNow
Can we watch The Wiz movie together next?
that's also why toto wasn't seen & the wiz actually sang--they cut the songs & toto was everywhere in the movie
@4princessmel Melly you are an idiot. the original play the wiz was an all black play. The movie the wiz is an all black movie.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen PS The movie The. Wiz. Yesterday on TV was Hot garbage. Thank you very much

True TALENT for FatimaRobinson to incorporate some of the original Choreography for the Original movie of the Wiz! I loved that! #TheWizLive

And NOW to watch "The Wiz" (movie)...since we're doing it, we may as well DO IT all the way. #TheWiz

The wiz is a phenomenal movie
The Wiz movie is better though in my opinion.
The Wiz was a terrible movie. They should have turned The Wizard into a TV musical instead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbqd2QMkuw …
The Wiz (movie) is honestly about being unhappy with your life and finally coming to terms to all things that you have to be grateful for.
@1979amish @melissafumero no, ignorant people who think it's the same thing as the Wizard of Oz movie are too stupid to understand The Wiz.
@LA_mag It's the Wiz. Not the KKK Grand Wizard of Oz. Apparently a lot of dumb asses never saw the movie.

Hush about the racism. During The Wiz Live, @NBC drops promos for two lily white upcoming events, Adele in Concert & Dolly Parton movie. Lol
These MFs didn't know The Wiz was an actual movie from back in the day.
I gotta say, this live production of The Wiz is really good! I never really enjoyed the movie but this stage production is awesome!
The Wiz is my all time favorite movie. Seen maybe a dozen school & local theater productions. Had the B'way cast album. I'm hella happy rn
People talking about the movie being the original but that was also a remake. The Wiz started with a stage play and they held true to it.
It's crazy how people are mad because The Wiz has an all black cast..... The first Wizard of Oz movie that came out in 1978 was all black...
One of the best things about "The Wiz" movie was the NYC imagery in Oz. Leaving that out is a fatal mistake, IMO. #TheWizLive
The wiz live wasnt terrible it jus aint have shit on the movie omm

in some ways the movie was better but this is still good...nipsy russell played the wiz...not complaining different era and actors
The movie version of THE WIZ isn't that great but I prefer the dystopic ghetto fantasy designs over the NBC version.

Sounds like I was too hard on The Wiz, giving it a pass because the 70s movie was 24 carat, uncut blech. (Take THAT, forty years ago!)
Racists: The wiz only has black people!!!! This is racist!!!!UGH Also racists:....why does it matter if that movie only has white people
I was really wondering if they were gonna be able to match or out do the Emerald City scene from The Wiz movie. They killed it!!!

I have got to say that The Wiz is not racist. Do your research. It wasn't racist when The Wiz movie came out. All black cast there too.
Y'all got it! THE WIZ was my 1st theater experince & my favorite movie ever.This play is a my life in so many levels. #TheWizLive
My BM just texted me, talking about she never liked The Wiz movie. She grew up on some White sht though, I forgive her
Has anyone complaining about the all black cast of The Wiz actually seen the original movie lolol
95% of anyone tweeting about The Wiz Live has absolutely no clue of the original Wiz movie.
if u haven't seen the movie adaption of the wiz i highly recommend it because it has michael jackson and diana ross in it and it's so great
I never liked The Wiz. I've even seen it live. Shanice is talented and I love The Wizard of Oz stories & movie, but not this. #TheWiz

When I was in town for Thanksgiving, my brother made a comment about "what if they remade a classic movie with all white people?" re The Wiz

Why are people tweeting about The Wiz being "racist" when it's a rendition of the original. Have they not seen or heard of the real movie
The Wiz was always a fully black movie .. What's the deal ? #TheWiz
My children enjoyed the Wiz(new edition) tomorrow they want to watch both! Love that they recieved a message in the movie.
Why is everyone acting like its a new thing The Wiz is cast by all black people. This movie has always been that way, it's so old lol
"Why is The Wiz an all black cast, people would be mad if it was an all white cast" Have you seen any big Hollywood movie ever in ur life
SANG LENA---> The Wiz (7/8) Movie CLIP - If You Believe (1978) HD https://youtu.be/DHzx2P4x63c  via @YouTube
The Wiz Live was so good but there's nothing like Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor, and the rest of the movie cast
The wizard of oz is a movie, the wiz is a stage play adaptation. I like the wizard of oz better as a cinematic experience
saw 10 minutes of the live Wiz & 10 minutes of live Peter Pan & I will say the Wiz destroyed Pan. Weird because I never loved the Wiz movie.
I give The Wiz live 3.5-4 of 5 stars. Job very well done. I'm spoiled by the movie. But. I enjoyed this. Well done, everyone involved.
The Wiz just gave me so much life. Like it was my favorite movie anyway but this was life
People who are saying The Wiz is racist bc of an all black cast sound ignorant it's a black movie lol smh
My dad and I decided we'll watch the Wiz the movie I loveee him man
Idk why people saying the wiz live is racist, name one white person you seen in the original movie...
"why isn't there an all-WHITE version of THE WIZ???" yo the wizard of oz is the whitest fucking movie of all time pic.twitter.com/VQuxrKkV43
@joemylife but I did enjoy the wiz both when I watched the movie and saw it on stage. And I adore queen latifah and uzo aduba!
Why didn't we watch The Wiz in Mr.Fallon's class instead of the original movie? The Wiz is 10x better?
#TheWiz now get thee to The Wiz movie and #stephaniemills on YouTube children
The Wiz (3/8) Movie CLIP - Ease on Down the Road (1978) HD http://youtu.be/oGxBx8RzzrM 
Why Everybody Talkin Bout The Wiz That Shit Came Out When Michael Jackson Was Still Brown Skin.....Movie Old As Hell
Feeling sentimental! The Wiz (7/8) Movie CLIP - If You Believe (1978) HD #TheWiz http://youtu.be/DHzx2P4x63c 
So glad my kids, who have been watching the movie the Wiz with me since they were four and six watched #TheWizLive with me!
just in case people watching the wiz forgot how cruel and arbitrary the world is, here's an ad for the new alvin & the chipmunks movie
Only caught the very end of The Wiz live. I've seen the movie though, if you haven't seen that go see it.
And the play came before the Wiz movie... So .. Stephanie Mills was the original Dorothy. Not Diana Ross
When I was a kid and you wanted to see the Wiz you had to walk to the theater and watch the movie with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross.
I Must need 2 watch from the beginning to feel it cuz I'm not really! The wiz is my all time favorite movie idk how/why I'm feeling so blah
I think they should have remade The Wiz as a movie , the live show was basically just singing and dancing. It was good but a lot got cut out
When I was 13, my mom was talmbout "The Wiz" and I told her I never saw it. This woman pulled that VHS out so fast b/c it's her fave movie.
The reason that I am really enjoying the Wiz! - I’m not comparing it to the movie or the original play I... http://tmblr.co/ZTvvfx1zH5J0y 
The Wiz Live was kinda stale. Maybe the movie ruined it for me.
That movie was pure GARBAGE RT @DJKayyOhh: The Wiz Live was better than The Fantastic Four movie
Cj like this movie, "The Wiz" he was smilin & laughin. But chillin wit Ma mama till work!!
I hope The Wiz Live is on again/on demand. My mom & I rented the video of the movie so much when I was little. Plus, that cast!!
I wanna watch The Wiz movie now
In the wiz movie the evil witch was a fat black woman who had exaggerated big nose and wide lips . Glenda was Lena Horne
@moonchild_30 did you ever see the wiz movie from 70s?
The fact that Diana Ross is the only main character alive from the original movie of The Wiz makes me sad :(9
I have always wondered why the movie The Wiz did so bad at the box office. A lot of older blk folks didn't support it but... #TheWiz
Glinda was beautiful on the Wiz the movie... #TheWiz live though pic.twitter.com/v3vYpd2GVh
@FlowsAndolini @abake6 it is NOT. it's a remake of the Broadway production of The Wiz. Not the movie.
Just like my cousin say watchin the WIZ movie, she already clicked them heels dancin she shoulda been home lol #TheWiz
Y'all know this is based on the Broadway version of the wiz and not the movie #TheWiz #TheWizLive
@Tyler_allison17 I would watch The Wiz 29 times over before I watch Elf or some other lame Christmas movie you need culture boy
I'm dating myself here, but The Wiz movie soundtrack being played on 8-track is a thing that happened in my childhood.
The legendary Lena Horne portrayed Glinda in the movie version of The Wiz #JonesingForTheWiz
The Wiz Live, because the movie wasn't bad enough.
wait how are white ppl mad the wiz live has an all black cast when the original the wiz movie was all black cast lmaoo
iont super understand this Nobody Beats The Wiz movie but im glad they got Queen Latifah as "everyday low prices/hands-on customer service"
Queen Latifah been killing way before The Wiz on the movie musical Chicago. #TheWiz pic.twitter.com/fsD1sFq85v
Watching The Wiz movie while high must be fucking terrifying
I don't think y'all realize The Wiz IS MY MOVIE
The #Wiz was my favorite movie growing up in Minnesota as a kid! Thanks for the memories. #senddorthyhome
How are white people mad about the wiz now when the movie came out in the 70's. Y'all had 40 years to be mad.
The Wiz the movie and The Wiz the musical are two different things!
@C_Luuu bro the wiz was a movie from like the 70s I think lol
The Wiz was and is still my ALL TIME favorite childhood movie. I am more than excited about… https://www.instagram.com/p/-2tRCbmu3m/ 
That metro scene from the wiz wasn't even scary lol I don't think I'm scared of anything fr movie wise lol
The Wiz is the ultimate liberation movie. From the captivity to the oppression to the freedom! WE WILL BE FREE! #TheWiz
The Wiz tonight is going of the original musical that was on Broadway .... Not this movie with Michael guys https://twitter.com/damngirlmelanie/status/672614720478838785 …
In my high school's melanin-challenged production of The Wiz we replaced many of the Revealed Wiz's lines with words from the MGM movie.
Fun Facts: The Wiz Original Play: 1974 (Stephanie Mills) Original Movie: 1978 (Dianna Ross) Millennial Version:... http://fb.me/3gqRPV3Ea 
So many of y'all think The Wiz was a movie first. None of the movie cast members y'all keep posting were the original lol
I’m not understanding why the language is that big of a deal. I know y’all have seen The Wiz, it was worse in the movie.
Don't remember this part of the wiz.... But I like it so far. Still doesn't beat the movie https://twitter.com/YahooMusic/status/672616012840198146 …
While we're on commercial let me remind some of u that The WIZ movie was adapted from a broadway STAGE production. #thewizlive
Crazy to think most of the people from The Wiz movie is dead now..
8.5..The Wiz the original movie is my favorite https://twitter.com/uniquely_sweet_/status/672614161927561216 …
I didn't watch The Wiz LIVE tonight but I still knew it was a remake of the PLAY and not the movie.....the play is the ORIGINAL!
They should have made a movie of the wizard of oz / the wiz when they went into the real world.
The Wiz (1/8) Movie CLIP - The Crow Anthem (1978) HD https://youtu.be/3r1ssg1LIt4  --- During the commercials... #EaseOnDown #TheWizLive
It's obvious those mad about the all black cast of "The Wiz Live" don't know the history of the "The Wiz" the movie smh
#TheWiz is definitive! Better than the movie!! #Love @luvbeingshanice @neyocompound @iamqueenlatifah — watching The Wiz Live
I find it so annoying that people are upset that the Wiz is filled with black actors. I'm guessing they've never seen the actual movie smh
RT #chrissyteigen: Donate to know that makes me really thoughtful look at the Wiz movie set, when Q taught him out of tech industry panel...
Not taking away from The Wizard of Oz cuz that was a great movie. The Wiz just has a different flavor
@BrittyBeautiful That Is the message...and why the wiz is my favourite movie of all time
This is a very good version of the play but I need to watch the movie The Wiz! #TheWiz #EaseOnDown
Crazy thing about The Wiz (the movie)...it was a commercial BUST.
I still think the original "The Wiz" is still the best. That movie was a classic
My favorite part of the movie The Wiz is when the Tin Man cries... so funny.
evillene always terrified me in the original movie of the wiz. mary j. blige is just awesome. bad news was outstanding! #THEWIZ
Real talk... The Wiz movie is down low scary to me.....still LOL! #TheWizconfessions https://twitter.com/divasanddorks/status/672607244383596544 …
Why is there a problem?The movie The Wiz is an all black cast... I swear people can't ever let us have our own stuff https://twitter.com/astoldbybrina/status/672484857105125376 …
Im at work missing it RT @BEAUTYTRAiL: Had a reminder set to watch the wiz, & couldn't even watch it tonight .I love that movie.
This movie the wiz is so weak to me
The Wiz was actually my favorite movie growing up. I knew every single lyric to every single song.
Queen went from Aunt Em in a Muppets movie to the wiz in a live production. Look at God.
And in the movie the wiz was from Jersey ironically being that's where Queen is from #TheWizLive
LOL-I'm loving the reveal. Reminds me when the Wiz was revealed to be Richard Pryor in the movie. #TheWizLive
@JeremiahEastman nobody is dragging white people, just the movie was stale lol the wiz is a lot better
The Wiz Live is so much different from The Wiz movie. It's fun in it's own rights
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/zy8dUJEOqos?a  The Wiz (6/8) Movie CLIP - Everybody Rejoice (1978) HD
*pause* why they had to preview the OJ movie during The Wiz though?? Ain't even showing on NBC
We won with the wiz ! Took the movie and turned it up! Now we on Broadway ... Again babyyyyyy
I don't care what anyone states, MJ was everything in the Wiz movie. For people to think of him when watching the new edition says a lot.
Everybody who really knows me, knows how I feel about the Wiz. I literally watched that movie like every other day
RT @Fare_Fare: BET needs to go ahead and air The Wiz movie tomorrow
I see er'body out the watching The Wiz. if you haven't seen the Original or Movie w/MJ & Diana Ross stick yo self you demoted to the B Team
The wiz was a classic movie I'm low key pissed at this battyman dances on here.
Imma have to find The Wiz this weekend and go in. The movie version of that last scene?? My lord https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy8dUJEOqos … #TheWiz
@bradnarok The Wiz movie is a real gem.
I'm far from being a fan of musicals but I enjoyed The Wiz on nbc. And I HATED the movie as a kid.
honestly if you've never seen the wiz movie you probably shouldn't watch this first because it's good but it's not doing it for me.
I am really enjoying The Wiz. Gotta get out my soundtrack to the movie. #TheWiz
But for real, check the Quincy Jones produced songs from the Wiz movie w Diana Ross, Michael Jackson & Nipsey Russell super musical talent
The scene where they sang A Brand New Day in The Wiz movie was amazing .. My favorite scene. #TheWizLive
Amazing production of the wiz @nbc #proudasapeacock I remember #1978 movie #breakthrough then n now pic.twitter.com/GISkZW4ROs
with black producers...enjoy the wiz fam RT @screamBRIx3: @TheReason540 a black lead actor doesn't automatically make it a black movie..
Catching the end of The Wiz Live and as a fan of the original play and movie I have to say...it's pretty terrible.
Yo the Wiz really wants you to see the Will Smith concussion movie. LIKE THEY REALLY FUCKING WANT YOU TO SEE IT.
I like the Wiz Live a lot but I miss the vocals from the movie. Mike Jack hit them notes in every song they sung. Him and Diana
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/oGxBx8RzzrM?a  The Wiz (3/8) Movie CLIP - Ease on Down the Road (1978) HD
@MarQuisJacksonJ I like The Wiz the movie better.. #TheWizLive pic.twitter.com/6A7lY3t3o2
im just trying to figure out why white people are mad over "the wiz" as if "the wizard of oz" isnt a movie -_-
I read folks was displeased with The Wiz Live having a all black cast but, the actual movie was also an all black cast, soooo?? #TheWiz
True story, Michael Jackson met @QuincyDJones on the Wiz movie set, when Q taught him to pronounce "Socrates". Later they made some albums.
His wasn't clear in the originals either! The Wiz the Wiz movie the Wizard of Oz! It wasnt clear anywhere! But I can feel the brand new day!
Let's see...lamest "remakes" of the year: The Aaliyah Movie, Whitney and now The Wiz. #epicfail #thewiz
nothing beats the Brand New Day scene in The Wiz the movie
The Wiz isn't racist just because they took a classic movie and made it into their own. It's not racist for an all black cast to do it.
The Wiz is HANDSDOWN my favorite movie.
I have never finished The Wizard of Oz. It's a very boring movie imho. Never bothered with The Wiz movie either. So this is new and good.
My favorite scene in the The Wiz the movie may have been the Changing of the Color scene, but for the Wiz,... http://fb.me/V7vf3Rqc 
Let's not forget "The Wiz Live" will be more like the original "The Wiz" Broadway production it was a STAGE play 1st NOT a movie
The movie the Wiz is ABSOLUTELY better not this musical https://twitter.com/payhomage/status/672610959538708480 …
The Wiz was an All-Black movie. Ain't Nothing racist. This is a bunch of BS. Stop trying to start ish. https://twitter.com/HollywoodLife/status/672589196515676161 …
The Wiz (7/8) Movie CLIP - If You Believe (1978) HD http://youtu.be/DHzx2P4x63c 
The Wiz movie with Michael Jackson is good too
A'Ti would love The Wiz that's on right now . This is her favorite movie of all time
I'm still afraid of this scene from the Wiz movie https://twitter.com/esqsound/status/672598505626705921 …
@lucky_chIoe honestly do white ppl even know the wiz is an old remake movie? a specifically black movie?
I know and the wiz is appropriating from the white movie https://twitter.com/missmandaesther/status/672597750886834176 …
Id rather watch the wiz movie even tho David Alan Grier is killin it
LMFAOO fav part of the old The Wiz Movie https://twitter.com/benadryi/status/672609844428337154 …
People need to stop comparing The Wiz LIVE & The Wiz MOVIE!
I was scared of those flying monkeys in the movie version of The Wiz. #TooCreepy #TBT # #TheWizLive
How bad is it that when someone at dinner mentioned The Wiz I thought they were talking about the Nintendo movie with Fred Savage?
@Anaheim27 because the movie the Wiz had an all black cast Dummy.
If you never saw the original the wiz movie you just need help lol
My girls wanna know how I know the songs from #TheWizLive I guess I'm going to have to show them The Wiz movie
is the wiz a movie or something can i watch it
Exodus: Gods and Kings, Noah, Passion of Christ, The Mexican, The Last Samurai, etc. we can enjoy The Wiz. it's just one movie.
You lose your black card if you never seen a spike lee movie or the wiz
Ok I'm here for this performance Mary... my fave song in the movie lol! — watching The Wiz Live
Mabel King played Evilene in the movie version of The Wiz #JonesingForTheWiz
The lion costume on the Wiz movie was dusty. That was a dusty ass hood lion but then again that was 1978 #TheWiz
wait people are actually mad that the wiz is an all black cast like have y'all seen the movie
been reading racist tweets about the wiz for weeks and i thought they were about the movie from 1978. was confused. I'm up to date now
gonna watch the movie the wiz first and then I'll catch the play. I'm excited about it.
Album covers and cast of the Broadway version, 2d movie and present movie of "The Wiz". pic.twitter.com/22do87EDbe
Pleaseeeee Mary, turn it up. The wiz movie did the shiiiiiit outta this song!
aye this bad news song use to be lit on the wiz movie
I saw the play the Wiz w/ Stephanie Mills in Denver,the movie w/ Diana Ross,now #TheWizLive w/ my girls. Oh my Neo! pic.twitter.com/4ooixeXzky
When the columns moved in the train station in the Wiz movie i was scared to get on the train for WEEKS. #TheWiz
We used to watch the Wiz movie a lot when I was a kid. But now I'm realizing I melded it with Return to Oz in my memory at some point.
The wiz movie is like 4 hours long! I'm so happy they shortened it
The wiz is my favorite movie of all time, so it's cool that they did this... But it's still nothing like the original.
I don't think that some of y'all know the wiz was an actual movie and a Broadway play. Not the wizard of oz but the wiz.
I'm loving this. Warms my heart. Reminds me of seeing the wiz the movie when I was 12 yrs old. #TheWiz
Fun fact: My mom was at Coney Island when they were filming scenes from the movie the wiz
The Wiz as a movie and The Wiz as a musical are really two separate things but I'm in love regardless.
#TheWiz Watching the Wiz!! All of the performers are Great Actors bringing this Iconic Movie to Life! I'm enjoying every minute!!
For those that never saw the movie "The Wiz", 2nites live play on @nbc is not great depiction of it. Please watch the movie. #TheWiz
Once again y'all...this is based off the Broadway production of The Wiz, NOT the movie...it's going to be different
Anyone else excited about The Wiz tonight? This is my all time favorite movie and I get to watch… https://www.instagram.com/p/-2oty0k3Iv/ 
I guess I'm the only one not watching the Wiz. I've never seen the full movie, it was kinda creepy but The Wizard of Oz is my FAV
@RaymondCurryJr It's a movie already dear.. It's called The Wiz with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson.. Came out in the 70's..
They just need to go ahead and remake the Wiz movie cuz if it's gonna be anything like this it's gonna be way better than the original
Really wanted to see the wiz live tonight even though I dislike 'the wiz' the movie... But all these finals are killing me.
I've always loved the added hotel scene from The Wiz movie & I like this new song #jonesingforthewiz
I love seeing the kids get to know The Wiz. This is how you keep stuff alive. Cause the parents too scared to watch the movie.
"The Wiz" ruined a perfectly good movie lol
@ElleeWoods when the original movie The Wiz was created, discrimination of black ppl in the acting world wasn't gone.
The Wiz Movie. Remember when this movie came out..everybody I knew wanted to see how the black versi http://pinterest.com/pin/171910910754505470/ …
I JUST REALIZED THAT THE SCARECROW IN THE WIZ LIVE IS SEAWEED FROM THE HAIRSPRAY MOVIE HOLY SHIT I LOVE ELIJAH KELLEY
My dad really just said "I'm not watching The Wiz live because it's not better than the original movie"
This is pretty great you guys. I wanna make watching this a pre-Christmas tradition. Like watching The Wiz movie is lol
@5Estrella_Jones if the Wiz is racist every movie without black people is
Sooooo The Wiz is based off the play not the movie
I like the wiz movie better
The Wiz was a Broadway show before it was a movie.... #TheWizLive
the wiz will forever be my favorite movie everyone has to see it at least once
I've never seen the wizard of oz or the wiz movie and I'm glad that #TheWiz is the first version I'm seeing
PLEASE STOP COMPARING THE WIZ MOVIE TO THIS PERFORMANCE! THIS IS LIVE, THAT WAS NOT!
When you watching the Wiz and damn near know it word from word because you watched the movie 48194929942x
Man I been knew about the wiz the original now everybody on it just cause if the play the movie still 10x better & forever my fav movie
I'm enjoying the Wiz.... As long as you separate it from the movie, you can enjoy it as a new live production.
#TheWizLive i we will be honest. The wiz movie wasn't a fav of mine, but this play just might be!!!!
Am I going to be dragged for saying this??? The Wiz sucks. This seems low budget like when Wendy Williams produced the Aaliyah movie.
#TheWiz People really complaining about the Wiz with a black cast?! It is based off the movie the Wiz with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross.
Folks...while Diana Ross is the survivor of the Wiz movie, the inimitable Stephanie Mills is still with us and starring tonight
Actually the movie is called The Wiz not The Oz but okayyyy
the fact that the wizard of oz is my favorite movie, is probably why the wiz doesn't appeal to me
Yall do realize The Wiz was originally a play right? Not a movie? The movie came after the play.
The wiz live rather watch the movie
Asked the director of THE WIZ movie: "Michael Jackson. Diana Ross. Quincy. Pryor. What was trickiest part of that balancing act?"
@KelciDCrawford No TV so I'll have to hope it hits NetFlix at some point. I recall the original The Wiz movie and it was great.
The wiz OMG I love this. Movie #TheWizLive pic.twitter.com/mEP4GdhsD4
I think they did a wonderful job casting The Wiz everybody is doing a great job what a blessing to remake an iconic movie!
The Wiz was an awful movie.
I'm not watching the Wiz but I can guarantee its better than Wizard of Oz that movie sucks
That was my favorite song in the Wiz movie. When my favorite rapper flipped it...dope
That's what I thought. To be honest though I haven't seen The Wiz movie since 1994. https://twitter.com/keithboykin/status/672604162023137280 …
I just recently found out about the Wiz movie and before I could watch it I find out about the Wiz live halfway through the broadcast. Damn!
Y'all remember Master P's movie "Repo?" Imagine if he has "The Wiz's" budget. Magic. Sheer magic.
The Wiz movie inspired that part of the video. https://twitter.com/ci_ditty/status/672600951061114880 …
i need y'all to understand that the " Original " version of The Wiz was a broadway play , then later made as a movie #TheWizLive
Each time you refer to The Wiz movie w/all-star cast from back in the day, you're not allowing yourself to experience now. #TheWizLive
The Wiz the movie will always be a classic , The play is amazing too
Remember the lil' metal faces that sang with the tin man in the wiz movie? They used to scare me on the low, but I'm grown now LoL
I remember in The Wiz movie that this song came when they first met the tin man... #TheWiz #EaseOnDown
All I know is Richard Pryor was The Wiz in the original movie. Now they up here calling Queen Latifah sir. I can't.
Currently crying because I can hear Nipsey killing this in my head, and it's reminding me how classic of a movie The Wiz. #TheWiz
They gave us a real, big budget, live production on national tv--no matter my thoughts on The Wiz movie, I'm loving this #TheWizLive #TheWiz
People The Wiz the movie was based on the PLAY.... The movie came after. I'm assuming this production is based on the play and not the movie
I love the wiz movie
I'm in my room singing my little heart out y'all don't understand the wiz is my FAVORITE movie
Why can't men watch The Wiz? Y'all try to make everything gay. This is a great ass production and the movie is great too.
This version of the Wiz is majorly different then the Diana Ross movie and it's actually ver fantastic
That's the WHOLE point of the movie. The wiz don't have powers! He was Richard Pryor with a mask and a robe on
Old people on Facebook pretending The Wiz movie was good....
@CharlieRDaley a movie came out in the 90s(?) called the Wiz starring Michael Jackson
Maybe I would understand this better if I seen the movie the wiz
My moms favorite movie is The Wiz ..she loved MJ just as much as I did/do
Yay! They brought back the Wiz’s songs. I was so sad they didn’t make the movie. But then again Richard P. Was the wiz…. #theWiz #EaseOnDown
i thought The Wiz was gon be an actually movie, the way they way the previews was looking
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/ZM0ZbfHUzIE?a  Ease On Down The Road in the style of The Wiz (Movie Version) karaoke
The Wiz is GREAT ! The Wiz is the black version of The Wizard Of Oz . Which was an all white movie so we made our own
Really dope set for the Wiz. I actually like this interior better than the movie one.
this is honestly so fun I think it's a lot more fun than the movie the wiz actually I think it seems more bright and colorful
I'm not able to watch the Wiz live so someone please inform me if they use those puppets from the movie. SCARIEST THING AS A CHILD
I loved that movie lol RT @DeJuanH: The wiz out here looking like meteor man. #TheWiz
Bro this a play of The Wiz movie why do yall keep comparing the 2?? Whats wrong with yall smh
I will make this brief...Ok so if you read the original book for the movie the Wiz of OZ then you… https://www.instagram.com/p/-2mhWcgyb0/ 
See. The Wiz unveiling is reminiscent of the many visuals that scared the crap outta me as a kid watching the movie. #TheWizLive
The Wiz is my favorite movie because it shows how great black ppl are. We couldn't be in the original so we remake it and make it better!
THIS VERSION OF THE WIZ MADE ME REALIZE HOW INCREDIBLY SPECIAL THE MOVIE WAS!
When older people get on Facebook complaining about The Wiz and can't tell the difference between a movie or play. pic.twitter.com/mKUmq7J6mT
I've figured it out, The Wiz is a mixture of the broadway play and the movie so If you only seen the movie, yo ass is going to be confused!
Who the hell is actually complaining about the Wiz's cast being predominately black? They obviously haven't seen the movie lmaooo
I hated the wiz, the original one, and to tell me that movie was "black excellence" is cuz they could of done way better.
I respect the Wiz the movie sooo much more now. That director was genius.
I loved that but I also loved the color changes in the wiz movie
As a kid I had a 'The Wiz' coloring book from the movie.
So I'm watching the wiz a lil on delay but did yall see they making an all white movie about dolly parton? I... http://fb.me/74NFkSNO7 
FYI to all the people comparing #TheWizLive to the wiz the movie: this is loosely based of the wiz the PLAY that was out before the movie
The wiz play is cute but the movie is better
I remember when THE WIZ movie debuted. It was slammed by "critics." Now it's a "cult classic."
We should not be comparing the wiz movie to the wiz live ....enjoy and appericate what our children are seeing now ..blk positivity #TheWiz
White people mad at the wiz but made a whole movie called wicked full of white people
The Wiz movie is all black and that came out in '78. The Wizard of Oz was all white in '39 remember? https://twitter.com/KoneyDetroit/status/666083443034296320 …
I used to be terrified of The Wizard of Oz. Both the movie & the plays. The Wiz would've been much better for my childhood development.
The Wiz is the first movie I remember going to see at Northwest movie theater on Pierson Rd. Flint family y'all... http://fb.me/1WvMPcU0S 
They did good and straight killing but they ain't touching the vogue scene when they was changing colors in "the wiz" the movie
awkward that a lot of these white publications live tweeting the wiz didn't even bother to skim the movie beforehand. #thewizlive
I'm sorry but I honestly am disappointed in The Wiz. The movie is such a classic and I just can't get with it. It has its moments though.
This was one of my favorite parts of the Wiz movie…with Quincy Jones and his cameo
The wiz movie was such a classic, I like how they are staying true to it, with a modern spin, cuddos #TheWizLive
Emerald City was lit af in The Wiz movie! Lol
Was there gay dudes doing suspect movements in The Wiz the movie ?
The wiz has always been my favorite movie when I was little I played Dorothy I just knew I was poppin
The "Wicked" movie preview was hella racist. WTF they mean the REAL story of the wizard of oz. . The Wiz is way better than the classic
This is honestly my favorite scene in The Wiz movie
Because white people never seen the actual movie The Wiz https://twitter.com/biebersvelIi/status/672584178169462784 …
Everybody from The Wiz movie is dead except for Diana and Quincy Jones. #TheWiz #TheWizLive
Yll blowing me , the wiz was a movie .. The wiz live is jii like a play 2 different things . Stop comparing stfu &' enjoy the show
People being all offended for the wiz reminds me when people were upset about the movie Annie
Really love the wiz of oz that's my movie
I could watch the wiz over and over again. I'll never get tired of that movie.
The poppy girls from the Wiz movie SERVED down pic.twitter.com/0pWIYE5Oee
I want to say that The Wiz movie isn't the original. It is based on the stage show that started in 1974. The movie came out in 1978.
@KevXIndy lol how about the poison poppies. The where hookers in the original movie. The wiz is coming eeeeeeeek
No fan of The Wiz movie + my kids were scarred 4 life by the parking lot scene. Didn't occur to us to view live show. Mistake or good call??
part of the brilliance of "The Wiz" the stage production and the movie is that they not only cast the right... http://fb.me/47KxrFINP 
Are we all watching the same thing?! Has everyone forgotten the original The Wiz movie??!! How do you all love this right now? #TheWizLive
if you think the Wiz is overly black and the actual movie The Wiz has BLACK characters then you probably should tune into something else
Considering my favorite movie is The Wizard of Oz I don't support anything other than that soo... The Wiz ?
Everybody from The Wiz movie is dead except for Diana and Quincy Jones.
REMINDER! #thewiz the movie with Diana Ross IS NOT the same as The Wiz the Broadway Musical with @PrettyMill1 ... #thewizlive
Hour into it and they already almost to The Wiz? Rushed. This was better off a movie.
they just giving bits & pieces of the wiz mane where todo? he was in the whole movie on the wiz , he aint even in the new one #TheWizLive
I'm so used to actual movie "The Wiz" naming parts that supposed to happened next and how to sing the songs like they did in the movie
I don't even like musicals but I love The Wiz. The Lion King comes first though because that's my favorite movie.
I am ashamed to admit I've never seen The Wiz movie. I'll fix that over the holidays.
You could be watching The Wiz on NBC right now or enjoying a classic Gamera movie on BMT. The choice is yours. pic.twitter.com/FNMYDMqHY3
@mistyknights @abitofarecluse that being said i only know the wiz as a movie and as a kid it felt REALLY LONG for some reason
Who remembers the Poison Poppy scene from The Wiz movie... Not for children! #TheWiz #TheWizLive #BlackTwitter
The wiz is the longest movie I have ever tried to watch.
"Don't they have the wiz as a movie" If you don't know the answer to that then why are you watching the play right now?
wow. some of yall down my TL really never saw the original movie The Wiz & that really make me upset ..
Watching "The Wiz Live" on @NBC. I think of how well @DianaRoss & @MichaelJackson played their parts in the movie! #TheWiz
I think the whole poppy scene in The Wiz (the movie) is underrated. That bass line >>>>>>> my LAWD
I thank God that my mom introduced me to The Wiz movie when I was younger. Idk how I'd feel without it.
The subway attack in the original The Wiz was seriously nightmare fuel for me growing up. Actually a lot of that movie was nightmare fuel.
The Emerald City scene in the wiz was my favorite part of the movie.
RT @ChristopherATL: This is still one of my favorite songs from the movie #TheWiz pic.twitter.com/pNMi58SDIQ **OMG THIS MY SONG..I MISS THE WIZ
If you've never seen The Wiz the Movie, you STILL need to watch it even if you're watching the play now.
I never did RT @itsCandyBxtch: Wait. Someone just said they never watched The Wiz the movie ?! #RevokedBlackCard
lol it's the black version of the wizard of oz it's originally a movie they're doing a special called the wiz live https://twitter.com/_thelastking/status/672595318228275200 …
:O “ @iamadimu: the scene in the wiz that switched the whole movie up pic.twitter.com/0D1Ad0ZBRJ”
Toto is not used throughout the LIVE productions of The Wiz... This is not a movie!!! #TheWiz
I grew up on the movie version of The Wiz. This live version is everything! #TheWizLive
I've watched the wiz movie so much growing up that I know all the songs on the wiz live
You already know I'm watching my favorite movie in a play The Wiz! #TheWizLive — watching The Wiz Live
I see they're trying to modernize The Wiz. I'm just so used to the movie lol. It's still good though...
I am not near a tv but are the Flying Monkeys in The Wiz like the motorcycle ones in the movie because that's my favorite part.
Remember The Wiz is "LIVE"...no different than a play you would see at The Fox Theater. Its not a movie...now tweet on down the road #TheWiz
I'm still scared of the movie version of The Wiz. Judge me.
How many of y'all have actually seen the stage play of The Wiz? NOT just the movie with Diana, Michael and them?
Wait. Someone just said they never watched The Wiz the movie ?! #RevokedBlackCard
The Wiz Live means Live and no it won't be like the movie cause it's not a movie.. But I understand you've never been to a broadway play
All these people that are criticizing The Wiz because it's not like the movie are ignorant. THIS IS A LIVE STAGE PRODUCTION NOT A MOVIE
FYI: You cant compare 2015's The Wiz Live to the 1970's The Wiz movie.
The Wiz original movie was an all black cast ! #TheWiz
Bruh I was scared as hell of them flying monkeys in the Wiz Movie when I was a kid. Lol #TheWizLive
The wiz the movie was scary
Did the wiz play or movie come first? It's usually a play first ain't it?
The wiz is my favorite movie ever OMG
The cast of the wiz the movie was so legendary it can never be fully recreated.
I didn't remember this scene from The Wiz movie but I forgot The Wiz movie did not stay entirely faithful to the original play #TheWiz
Also, Stephanie Mills played Dorothy in the real original "The Wiz" on stage. The movie is not the original. Thanks. #TheWiz
OMG y'all the subway scene in the wiz movie used to scare the shit out of me
I have never seen The Wiz movie so I am certainly not going to watch whatever is on TV now.
First of all, yall are 40 years late. The Wiz has BEEN a movie with a black cast and everything. It was lit too.
In the Wiz movie they're silver love https://twitter.com/nofcksx3/status/672596637051691008 …
Am I tripping?? I swear The Wiz was in movie fashion because I remember Richard Pryor being whimsical AF until that current dropped! #TheWiz
The WIZ live is just ok I rather see it as a movie then a play
The wiz Mj and Diana already did that nothing new just remixed for kids who missed that movie the 1st two times
If you've never saw The Wiz the movie, then I feel for you.
The Wiz was originally a Black Movie. Let us live, damn https://twitter.com/itsalwaysdaryl/status/672591348470517760 …
I like this version by Ted Ross. #TheWiz The Wiz (4/8) Movie CLIP - I'm a Mean Old Lion (1978) HD https://youtu.be/WjyJ_ZUEMEw  via @YouTube
I hate The Wiz the movie bc Centric played it back to back one thanksgiving and my family never changed the channel. This? I'd watch all day
The Wiz! I love the movie, Dorothy played by Diana Ross was so amazing to see. #TheWizLive https://www.instagram.com/p/-2jajEFzdC/ 
added Stephanie Mills to my Spotify and going to add the Wiz movie to my Christmas movie rotation. Feeling good feels watching #TheWiz
They're following the movie more than the play. Makes me wonder is Latifah will sing any of the Wiz's songs. #TheWiz
Watchin the Wiz play makes me wanna watch the actual movie
For those watching The Wiz,expecting it to be like the movie. Remember it was originally a musical.
y'all do realize the wiz was a real movie . y'all acting like this all black cast is something they just made up.
I loooovvvvveeeeddd the wiz the movie but I'm not so in love with this play.
Looooord .. RT @Sublime00: When you were a kid watching The Wiz, the movie, and didn't realize the (cont) http://tl.gd/nlfjq3 
Michael Jackson remained in character after playing The Scarecrow in the Wiz movie.
1. I have never seen a production of The Wiz. But my neighbor's daughter-in-law was a munchkin in the movie, so I'm like halfway there
well....you said it " @stRHOkemyEEEgo: I've never seen the movie adaptation of The Wiz. Sue me and take my black card if you must"
Stephanie Mills.. the original Dorothy on Broadway's version of the Wiz... she was backdoored by Diana Ross from being in the The Wiz movie
Yo if you want other adaptions of the movie then do it. The people behind the Wiz had a vision and they made it happen.
the scene in the wiz that switched the whole movie up pic.twitter.com/ywSWghIX52
The Wizard of Oz has always been my favorite movie but "The Wiz" is far greater. I'm so in love with this play.... http://fb.me/20x37BlFL 
I still got The Wiz on DVD... The original movie.
If you didn't know that The Wiz was a Broadway production years before the movie.....please hush and stay away!
The Wiz Live is based on the Broadway play version, not the movie version for those who don't know. So its a little different. #TheWizLive
I'm trying to figure out how y'all dumb asses thought this was a movie when it CLEARLY SAYS THE WIZ LIVE
I'll be watching the wiz movie after this #TheWiz
the wiz the movie is the shit. not at all excited about the play. maybe cause Diana and Michael ain't there.
This is cute but nothing beats The Wiz movie
The Wiz (6/8) Movie CLIP - Everybody Rejoice (1978) HD http://fb.me/6TESZvIgS 
Didn't Nipsy Russell play the lion in the movie? #the wiz
The Wiz live and the movie are two different productions of course they'll be different similar but different
I wanna watch the wiz movie now. But it don't even come on tv and it's not on Netflix
movie , book , play , audio tape the wiz is still LIT
This what my favorite part of the wiz movie #TheWiz https://twitter.com/rashvision/status/672590961717940228 …
the wiz movie and this wiz live are both better than the wizard of oz in my opinion
The wiz the movie is lowkey scary tho lbs
I have a confession; I watched the movie The Wiz when I was younger and got scared so I never watched it again.
/i would buy the wiz on remastered dvd and stream it with everyone so ppl can understand how much i love the movie cuz this live version...
All I know is THE WIZ. This movie made my childhood. This is awesome they are doing this #TheWizLive
@LuvbeingShanice I missed 30 mins of the WIZ being at school but in my mind I was remember the movie. And when I get here, I was at the part
If you have not the actual movie the Wiz please watch it. Forever a classic .
David Allen Greer the Mean ole lion. He can sing!!!! That is the same way the song is in the movie version of the Wiz @NBCBLK #TheWiz
I need to find the original The Wiz stageplay and see the differences from the movie
I'm slightly confused why whites people are expressing this fake outrage about The Wiz Live as if there wasn't already a movie.
i don't understand this movie "the wiz"
If you look at this as if it's a separate movie from the Wiz, this is spectacular.
Watching the #Wiz Live on television. Remake of the movie musical the Wiz pic.twitter.com/n2VpixJy9J
i've never seen the wiz stage play.... only the movie.
when 8 people show up to see the last movie and you cant convince them to watch the wiz instead :'( #movietheaterprobs #bigscreenwiz
The movie version of the Wiz IS NOT the original. It was a Broadway musical first in 1975. It even won a Tony award #TheWizLive
Confession: I have never liked the wiz .. As a kid I was scared of that movie therefore I won't watch the play either fuck it ️
For those who are a little confused or looking for certain scenes.. Before The Wiz was a movie (which is what... http://fb.me/2rHvYYmcH 
@BettyKills @jleggs_x The Wiz (movie from 70's and what this play is) is an all-black version of Wizard of Oz. it's an all black movie/play
Kinda blowed the Wiz is a play. I thought they remade the movie. I'm not watchin these niggas..
I'm tuning into The Wiz tonight solely of off Michael Jackson being in the original movie
Hoping folks realize that this is an adaptation of the original stage play and not the made for TV movie, "The Wiz".
I'm loving this. This is too cute. The wiz was always my favorite black childhood movie.
Right now, I'm settling in for a long night of..."The Wiz." The movie with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. THE WIZ. Thanks, Cmdr. Lewis?
The Wiz Live trivia: was the song from the Emerald City sequence in the play or only in the movie? #TheWiz #WatchParty
And I'm not being picky about this play. The wiz has been my favorite movie my whole life. And they changin too much stuff for me.
As much as I love musical theatre, The Wiz movie terrified me as a child. Still have a hard time watching any performance. @nbc #TheWiz
The Wiz was my favorite movie as a kid
It really doesn't matter how many times they redo The Wiz, the movie traumatized me for life #TheWizLive
...from the movie.I know The Wiz.So I did my research.showed my receipts she was silent after that then mumbled something under her breath
So my favorite movie of all time The Wiz has a stage play playing on NBC right now I'm highly excited hopefully... http://fb.me/RzCakNLZ 
The original version of The Wiz was on Broadway in 1975. Then they made the movie with Diana Ross, MJ, Ted Ross and the rest of them in 1978
Enjoying the Wiz. I recall seeing it with Stephanie Mills in 1975. I later saw the movie and still have the Soundtrack on an LP. #TheWiz
I wonder how they were back when the Wiz movie came out they wasn't even tripping fr back then, so why now ? https://twitter.com/deric__/status/672591359165923328 …
A lot of us disappointed because we've seen the actual movie The Wiz & loved it & so we thought this would be the same ... It's not #TheWiz
I can't get over the fact y'all thought THE WIZ LIVE meant a movie we have to educate our peers
I've watched the wiz movie so much. I know all that by heart. did a production of it at church once
These tweets Im seeing -___- Yeah it's not as good as The Wiz the movie, but I don't think they're trying to be. That could NEVER be topped!
Attention; the wiz is not a remake of the movie the wizard of oz. it is a stage musical that was based off of the orginal book. #TheWizLive
I must say that doing a remake of such iconic movie "The Wiz" is crazy. But they are doing a great job. #thewiz30
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz came out as a book in 1900 then a movie in 1933 The Wiz came out as a Broadway show in 1974 then a movie in 1978
Saw The Wiz as a 5 yr old on Broadway, then the movie at 6 which my sons and I still watch regularly & now enjoying #TheWizLive #tradition
The Wiz the movie is really the GOAT. So we're naturally hard on them right now. But. If it's meant to copy the Braoadway production...
I should really rewatch The Wiz movie...all yall talking about how similar the play is and I'm like pic.twitter.com/66ZehL15L9
living rn sorry. the wiz is my second favorite movie ever made. Pineapple Express is the first haha
I swear I'm baking Christmas cookies and watching The Wiz the movie this weekend! Making miss D. Ross and CO #TheWiz
For the people in the back: "THE WIZ" IS THE BLACK VERSION OF "THE WIZARD OF OZ"!! THE ORIGINAL CAST ON BROADWAY WAS BLACK & IN THE MOVIE
also. THE WIZ CAST HAS ALWAYS BEEN BLACK. the first broadway production was in 1975, & again in 1978 as a movie: pic.twitter.com/jRKDcMeHPu

7 Fun Facts About 'The Wiz': Broadway Play, Movie and TV Special http://fb.me/7E31QM2qD 
It's. So great to watch the wiz and remember our show from this year lol mr.Davis truly brought the movie out in our show
There would have been ZERO points of this version of The Wiz being "exactly" like the movie you all have seen.
I really love the wiz after this I'm gonna watch the movie
So far The Wiz live has been great. I'm just a Stan for the actual Wiz movie. It's hard not to compare.
Googled "The Wiz" and found out it's a 1970's movie aka NOT the Wizard of Oz but rather a cultural rendition. Learn something everyday.
I've never seen the stage production of The Wiz. Seen the movie several times as a young child tho.
Y'all aint realize Dorothy was ready to fight nd had a attitude. Dorothy on the original the wiz looked scared half the damn movie #TheWiz
I dont really care for the Wiz movie besides the soundtrack but I heard who was gonna be in it & wanted to watch it. my mom isnt here for it
I'm a little disappointed The Wiz Live is based on the stage version and not the movie. Missing all the NYC references.
I've heard a couple songs from The Wiz but just never the movie. Seeing this Live version makes me want to watch the original even moooore
I hate the movie "The Wiz" to much singing
The Wiz Live was bound to be ass because The Wiz the movie wasn't even good and that cast was like a black entertainment all star team.
The gag is the movie version of The Wiz wasn't popular when it came out. It wasn't until YEARS later that people loved it.
My favorite part of The Wiz the movie is with the Scarecrow. Elijah Kelley as the Scarecrow nailed that scene. #TheWizLive
...Damn. I thought they were gonna do the original "ease on down" from The Wiz movie. #TheWiz
I saw the Wiz on Broadway too.... Nothing compares to the movie.
I wanna watch The Wiz movie now #TheWiz
I'm not feeling this, I guess being that the original The Wiz is my fav movie I was expecting better. #TheWiz
They are silver in The actually Wizard of Oz story and the Wiz, they were only changed to ruby for the Movie OZ https://twitter.com/aves_fave/status/672588333156057088 …
The Wiz ( movie ) was slick scary to me lmao.
I'm loving the wiz live but nothing is better than the movie
The Wiz (1/8) Movie CLIP - The Crow Anthem (1978) HD #TheWiz #TheWizLive http://youtu.be/3r1ssg1LIt4 
Y'all are comparing The Wiz Live to the movie The Wiz when y'all need to be comparing it to the Broadway version The Wiz
Confession: I've never seen the whole movie (the wiz) the tape on the vhs was tangled and always cut off near the end
I watched the Wiz for like two weeks straight when I first saw it, I knew the entire movie verbatim
I think this will be my definitive version of The Wiz until further notice. The movie was meh for me #TheWizLive #EaseOnDown
I didn't like the wiz as a movie sooooo lol
"And now, a live broadway musical. Except we're going to do the movie version with dumber lines and worse songs" - NBC, introducing the wiz
#TheWizLive!! Smiling because I remember seeing The Wiz on Broadway & the movie, The Wiz as a kid.. now watching with the lil bfly! #sing
My mom sat us down and MADE us watch the wiz. I didn't realize the weight of that movie until I grew up
he gave the best performance in the entire Hairspray movie and he's already KILLING it in The Wiz!!!!
The Wiz is my fav movie so you know I'm excited af right now
About to buy a DVD because apparently the 70s movie adaptation of "The Wiz" is not streaming anywhere
Trying to focus on sports but am too distracted remembering how terrible Diana Ross was in the movie version of "The Wiz"
In the movie The Wiz this is when my mom would always reference Michael Jacksons original nose #TheWizLive
Elijah Kelley is doing great! I've never seen the original The Wiz play, but it's HARD to matchup to MJ's performance in the movie #TheWiz
... even though The Wiz was a black movie...?
One of my favorite songs from the Wiz movie. You can't win! #TheWizLive
OMG #MichaelJackson use to sing this part in the original movie version of The Wiz #TheWiz I REMEMBER like it was yesterday!
I've always love The Wiz it's always been my favorite movie! Seeing it live is giving me life #TheWizLive
I love the Wiz! I've watched the movie a billion times, was in the play, forever in love!
The scarecrow scene is my favorite from the wiz movie, Michael Jackson was amazing
The wiz on tv is not mocking the movie, it's the screen play so don't don't compare the two.
Are there really some white tears being shed over The Wiz? I guess the 1978 movie never happened. This is not new people.
This is MUCH better than The Wiz, the movie. #iSaidIt #SoSueMe
The wiz got me geeked af I love this movie and play now
Well, at least the crows aren't as scary as they were in the Wiz movie. They do seem a tad meaner though #TheWiz #EaseOnDown
MJ's You Can't Win is my favorite tune from The Wiz movie, though If You Believe right there.
The crow costumes are a huge upgrade from the costumes in The Wiz movie, IJS. #TheWizLive

No one can top Michael Jackson's scarecrow performance in The Wiz. Movie or play. #TheWiz
I didn't enjoy the Wiz movie so I won't be watching the Broadway version
Now I want to watch Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow in THE WIZ movie! #TheWizLive
y'all gotta understand The Wiz (Broadway), The Wiz (Play), The Wiz (Movie), and The Wizard of Oz won't be the same verbatim!!!
Michael Jackson came on board for The Wiz movie, primarily because Dianna Ross made it happen #JonesingForTheWiz
I had no idea the wiz was gonna be live it looked like a tv movie in the commercial
Like the Wiz was unapologetically black everything about that movie was black and ghetto fabulous
Hello white people offended by The Wiz' entirely black cast - welcome to essentially every movie ever for poc.
The Wiz,the movie, was highkey creepy lol. Esp the subway scene with the monkeys and moving walls. And when them hoes drugged them
The Wiz was just a great movie!! IDC IDC IDC IDC That Cast! That dancing! The energy! The BLACKNESS!!
I just don't wanna see the Wiz redone- hell I never finished the movie!
Jay and I found The Wiz movie at the pawn shop on Walnut today for $2. Winners. We need to watch that asap. I might steal it from him.
steohanie mills was first in orginal musical the wiz before the movie donna ross
Hey dumbass folks, there's an all white cast of the movie The Wiz is fucking called The Wizard of Oz. Pinche estupidos. Pendejos #TheWiz
If you haven't seen the original screen play or original movie versioning the wiz with Michael Jackson, I'm going to need you to do so
Watching the wiz live cause I actually watched "The wiz" movie massive times. Y'all trippin
I didn't want to say it but I'm really not feeling The Wiz. Doesn't help that I didn't like the movie either. *shrugs*
People, for the LAST time....The Wiz was a play FIRST, before it was a movie. Thanks. #TheWizLive
Lets not compare The Wiz, the movie, to the The Wiz the LIVE PLAY!!! Different time and generation.
like the original "Wiz" play was more like "The Wizard of Oz", the movie "The Wiz" is wayyyy diff..
If I'm overly passionate about The Wiz it's because of the connection I experienced with the movie as a child. It doesn't have to top it
@josephjoeyjoe1 the wiz was originally a play before the movie
I'm only familiar with the movie version of The Wiz. So I can't really tell what's been tweaked. Enjoying it all the same.
The Wiz (movie) TERRIFIED me as a kid. So many things totally creeped me out about it ... but I'm willing to give the live one a try.
Whoever is playing the scarecrow better kill that. Best song in the whole movie besides HES THE WIZ.
Y'all keep hyping up the wiz movie when y'all know the only thing good about it was Michael Jackson everything else was trash
Man the wiz with Diana Ross n Michael Jackson have my ass jigging. That's a great ass movie
Im happy for black people.. People sleep on the Wiz and no one knows when I sing this shit.. Just get the word out so we can watch the movie
This is the remake of "The Wiz" the Broadway show, not the movie! Don't start hating and acting the monkey already...lol! #thewiz
I watched the movie version of The Wiz 1000 times with the kids. We are loving the live version. #FIOSPhilly
@ people who are mad that #TheWiz play is an all black cast when it's been that way since "The Wiz" MOVIE in 1978 pic.twitter.com/czRPyCV878
I'll catch up on the wiz another time, Twitter chatty patties take fun out of watching the movie anyways
When you watch the wiz the movie.... The concern & distraught look you see in Diana's eyes was her thinking about her next high
Friends, the Broadway production of the Wiz is different than the movie....just a heads up, there won't be a "you can't win" number
i think i love the musical of The Wiz better than the movie version already
The Wiz (movie) soundtrack was incredible because of the horn section.... #TheWizLive
White people keep mentioning how #TheWizLive is racist because it's an all black cast... Uh, have y'all seen The Wiz, the movie???
FYI all #TheWiz is based off the original Broadway musical. Its not a remake of The Wiz movie.
If someone makes another The Wiz movie, @chrisbrown should be The Scarecrow!!!
Favorite part of The wiz (movie): IM A LIIIIOOOOONNNNN
If you've ever seen The Wiz movie and are now watching this, then you'll notice this stayed far away from it #TheWizLive
Some of yall have never seen the movie the wiz smh like I known every word since I was 5
Please know that The Wiz is originally a BROADWAY musical not the movie.
I really loved the delicate tones and instrumentation on the Wiz Movie sounds with Diana but I'll get into this.
The Wiz is an important movie/play in African American history #TheWiz
The wiz was the best movie of all time . I love Michael Jackson part when he sings
@Refinery29 it was silver in the book, so The Wiz is more authentic than The Wizard of Oz movie
1 thing I liked about The Wiz movie as a kid was recognizing NYC landmarks - library lions, wards island bridge, World Trade Center
tbh, the wiz will always be better than the original version of the movie.
Haven't watched the Wiz the movie since I was a kid. I know this #TheWizLive is based off the stage play.
Watched the Wiz movie many times as a kid. My favorite was Nipsey Russell as Tin Man. Looking forward to watching this new one with my kids!
The Wiz doesn't follow the Movie
I feel like I should be watching the wiz but it's like I grew up on that movie so I feel like I'm not missing anything
So you're tell me that you've never heard of The Wiz ? Like, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson were in the movie.
@nyngaile I haven't seen The Wiz play in a long time so I was looking for the movie version lol
Now that's how you make people forget the movie's slick, jazzy rendition of "He's The Wiz". @MsAmberPRiley jamming on the one. #TheWizLive
Idgi why whites are mad bc they're just now finding out about the wiz bc of the play & calling it racists the movie has been out for years?
Watching The Wiz on NBC. I’d always been curious. I heard the musical was good, but the movie was terrible,... http://tmblr.co/ZBkT2y1zGdt3r 
If you're a fan of the 1978 movie "The Wiz" don't be so quick to compare it to tonight's stage play. Be open minded. You just might like it.
Y'all know The Wiz is my fav movie.
- To those complaining about #TheWiz that's on @NBC. It's a little late for you guys to complain when The Wiz the movie came out years ago
"He's the Wiz and he lives in Ozzzzzz." My favorite song of the whole movie and now play. #TheWiz
Alright now! Ahhh she did that! Watching the Wiz live on NBC. I love the movie so it's only right… https://www.instagram.com/p/-2evwElHrn/ 
I like this so far....it's very bright and The Wiz movie is much darker but this is enjoyable so far
They should redo the Wiz movie
I love the wiz I kinda wanna watch the movie now
#TheWizLive as a music teacher in NYC - The Wiz movie is a staple in my curriculum every year because of the talent and the symbols
Nothing so glaringly awkward as going from "The Wiz" to a commercial for a Jennifer Lawrence movie.
the wiz is a great ass movie lollll
Omg i wish amber could replace that other lady in the wiz movie. Ambers voice is so... #TheWizLive pic.twitter.com/TmSd8PyZsp
Honestly the actual "The Wiz" movie use to scare me. But this is my speed lol #TheWiz
kinda mad I'm missing the wiz, the movie is one of my favorites all because of MJ
"He's the wiz and he lives in ozzzzzzzz" one my fav songs from the movie #TheWiz
Omg #TheWiz omg they are doing good I haven't seen this movie in so long "He's the wiz and he lives in Oz"
S/o to everybody who thought the "Wiz Live" was a movie lol
Saw the original touring cast of The Wiz in 1978 at the Ahmanson, don't think the movie was very good, and for once, wish I had a TV.
I thought the Wiz would be like the movie but it's a musical .......
He's the wiz has always been one of omy fave songs of the movie and @MsAmberPRiley is killing it! #TheWizLive
I love plays & the fact I cnt really watch this Wiz play I can still feel NOTHING BEATS THE ORIGINAL. The Wiz is one of my FAVORITES movie
All these racist youngins have no idea the ALL WHITE version of the #Wiz WAS the 1939 movie THE WIZARD OF OZ. Duh that's why we have The Wiz
Poor I have all the copy of the wiz with brandy and the old versions I love this movie https://twitter.com/zay_notoven/status/672584042898964480 …
Confession: I just saw The Wiz movie about 4 years ago.
The Wiz Live follows more of the Broadway play than the movie and its CLEARLY been modernized. Can yall relax?
This song and the tin mans song were to favorite songs to sing along to while watching The Wiz movie. #thewiz
#TheWizLive ooo! "He's The Wiz" is one of the songs I sang on the movie soundtrack!
Ok...so it's a mix of the original play, the wizard of oz, and the Wiz the movie with a modern twist. I get it now.
The wiz is a movie, this is the play based off the play. It is not going to be an exact rendition.
I'm a nerd because I'm excited watching this reproduction of the wiz , such as classic movie .
They better dance down on this song like they did in The Wiz movie.
I'm really sitting here watching The Wiz Live. I haven't watched the actual movie since day care because it scared the shit out of me.
I grew up watching The wiz 3x a day. Lmao fav movie hands down
The Wiz live is cute but it's too many changes from the original movie The Wiz  it's cute though I like the comedy they adding in!
welll i like The Wiz movie bettter but this straight
I still have the Wiz on vhs , and still watch it till this day. It's my favorite movie. I'm on the fence so far...
as an FYI RT @BerthaNichole: Note: the Wiz live is going to be more true to the Broadway musical, not the movie.
Okay, so, it's going to be hard for me to not picture 'The Wiz' movie during this production. #TheWizLive
Many people don't know that The Wiz was originally a Broadway production. The movie came after. Stephanie Mills was the original Dorthy.
The Wiz was an all time classic for my family, from my granny to my mother to me. We all loved that movie.
The wiz with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross will forever be my favorite movie
#TheWizLive I never saw the Wiz on stage but it is definitely different from the movie in terms of setting and details.
For those who don't know the wiz live is based off the Broadway play and not the wiz movie so some parts may seem different
@_CongoRilla_ The Wiz was a movie In the 80s with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross
@mcgee_gorgo The Wiz movie is ... insane but I love the music.
Watching The Wiz. The set looks so much more like a stage set then The Sound of Music did. I feels like you're watching a play, not a movie
It's crazy that people are really trippin off this all black cast of the wiz LIKE YALL HAVENT SEEN THE ORIGINAL WIZ MOVIE WHERE YOU BEEN
this is the ultimate black family movie lol " @quitechaotic: Anyone else not see The Wiz, ever?"
The wiz may just be the worst recreation of a good movie
how are white people gonna say the wiz live is racist because its an all black cast when the movie is ALL BLACK
Sorry y'all, I had only seen the movie version of The Wiz... My bad. Let's enjoy together now #TheWiz
Disclaimer: The Wiz Live is done how the the play was on broadway ...Not the movie
I thought the wiz was going to b a movie
I guess so. I had only seen The Wiz movie ...my bad, y'all! https://twitter.com/LetMeSleepDamn/status/672583794424070144 …
If you have never seen the movie The Wiz please stfu... There is no reason to compare a play and the original movie
@106th @writelikeryan isn't this based off the The Wiz play and not the movie?
The wiz was a remake the original wiz was a all white movie. Diana Ross did the black wiz which is how this musical came about.
The Wiz was my favorite movie growing up so y'all know I'm watching
My mom said I must be the only black person that doesn't like The Wiz, Idc I really hate that movie
Alright tv i guess The Wiz wins for tonight for me. Never saw the movie so why not watch this production live #TheWizLive
I've never seen the stage production of the wiz, only the movie, so this should be interesting #TheWiz
Yall realize that this is based of The Wiz, The Play and not the movie right?
now i could listen to stephanie mills ALL DAY (also, mom took over my tv so I'm forced to watch the wiz although i hated the movie)
Again for the balcony RT @ZephaniahShow: FYI: #TheWizLive is based off the original Broadway musical. Its not a remake of The Wiz movie.
The Wiz was a Broadway show before the movie
Me too except I like the Wiz and Grease for Nostalgia reasons. But this Wiz is based on the play not the movie :( https://twitter.com/CVWestbury/status/672582881647153152 …
PSA: The Wiz is based of the BROADWAY SCRIPT not the live movie
The original "The Wiz" 1978 movie was the real #ThanksgivingWithBlackFamilies
@sydderss_ but they adjusted the other two musicals to the movie cuz of familiarity so why not the Wiz
Watching the wiz... I wish this was the actual movie and not the play.
Ok. Shut up now. THE WIZ is on! (LOVED the movie - esp Nipsy Russell!) Ok. Shhhhh she singing like butter
I've never even seen the wiz movie
For the record, The Wiz play came before The Wiz movie (which differs from the play) and #TheWizLive is based off the play.
I love the movie version of the wiz too. but this ain't that. seriously...for the one bazillionth time. support it or don't but stop bitchin
This is going to be odd for hose of us whose only exposure to The Wiz is the awful, awful movie. #TheWiz
this fake ass The Wiz movie
Put on NBC rn there is this movie called the wiz it's the black version of the wizard of my oz no joke
Yall remember that the wiz was a play before it was a movie. And this special is based off the play.
Here you go lol RT @sleep2dream: Was the stage version of The Wiz set in some rural area? because the movie was based in Harlem #TheWiz
The setting for the intro seems more like The Wizard of Oz than The Wiz (unless the play is different from the movie...) #TheWiz
@colonelnemo the movie. The Wiz movie alternated from The Wiz movie
Wait, she didn't start off here in The Wiz movie. Or am I buggin?
Ease on down the road! I love "The Wiz" and saw it in the movie theater on its 1978 release
#confession The Wiz was the first movie, I ever watched. Till this day I am thankful for that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiz_(film) …
That's how long the damn movie was. Long AF RT @KP_Trill: The Wiz live is 3 hours long? good luck wit that
I think some are confused…this isn't a remake of the Diana Ross/MJ The Wiz MOVIE version…
Y'all did know that The Wiz (play) is different from The Wiz (movie), right? #TheWizLive
if i watch "the wiz live" movie thing would it count as my choir project
Okay...so guise.....we aren't watching the MOVIE The Wiz.
Since I've only seen the Wiz movie I'm soooo confused right now. I was expecting it to look like the family dinner on SoulFood right now.
SO glad Stephanie Mills is in this. They played the shit out of her on The Wiz the movie.
In Elementary School we watched the Wiz movie and I had no idea what was going on. Lets see how this goes #TheWizLive
Y'all The Wiz really my favorite movie of all time.. I'm freaking out rn
My mom is making my brother and I watch "The Wiz Live" I mean i've never seen The Wizard Of Oz or The Wiz movie so this is exciting!
I haven't seen The Wiz movie since I was a kid. Which is surprising, since I loved it. #TheWizLive
did u know i have never seen the wiz BUT i hate wizard of oz movie AND i am obsessed with the books. little bground on this kid right here
Before someone else complains about The Wiz: live having an all black cast, just remember...THE WIZ IS A BLACK MOVIE.
With Merritt Vossler because it's HIZ favorite movie — watching The Wiz Live
So, wait. . . the Broadway version of The Wiz is more like The Wizard of Oz, as opposed to the original Wiz movie? . . . Hm. #TheWizLive
I am so excited about The Wiz! I used to watch the movie all the time when I was little
For the record The Wiz is a way way way better movie than the original Wizard of Oz
I never even seen the Wiz movie lol
Y'all if y'all know me,y'all know the Wiz my movie!!!! Soooo I'm losing my mind at the Broadway show right now!
Turned off the end of Chloe's favorite movie to watch the wiz. Dead serious.
i remember i didn't like the movie version of the wiz too much. too long and poorly paced. and diana ross wasn't no damn teenager.
Notice to all those watching the Wiz! The Broadway production is not the same as the movie, music… https://www.instagram.com/p/-2cf59pk0Y/ 
Like the Wiz is my favorite movie & I saw it live a few years ago. Great experience can't wait to see how this turns out
The Wiz my favorite movie they bet not fuck it up
The Wiz tonight! :) So excited. Favorite movie as a kid.
I love The Wiz movie. I wish I was around back in the day to see Stephanie Mills sing "Home."
Never seen The wiz movie but I guess I'll watch this lol
The Wiz was a terrible movie. Yeah, I said it. I don't even care. It was awful.
im so excited the live version of the wiz better be good or im going to be mad about them messing up my favorite movie

The Wiz(movie version) is truly Horrible... but I heard they've turned it around
I grew up watching The Wiz constantly,I know every song word for word, hell probably the whole movie & i am nowhere near ashamed. #TheWiz

literally the wiz is my favorite movie this live one is gonna be lit
True fact: I love the Wiz and I like it more than the Wizard of Oz movie or play.
Part of what I didnt like in The Wiz movie was how cobbled together everything looked. I wanted pretty and sparkly & it wasnt that.
Here's the thing, the movie version of The Wiz? I didn't love it as a child BUT it was the first time I saw positive black ppl in a musical
idk the wiz is my fav movie & this production will slay
Why ppl acting like the wiz some new movie when Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, & Richard Pryor were in the fi...nvm, my generation retarded
So apparently The Wiz is racist for casting all blast actors when the original movie had all black actors #TheWizLive
White people mad because the Wiz is and all black play? But the original movie was an all black cast
The Wiz i know this movie word from word
how tf is the wiz racist for having an all black cast? the wizard of oz had all whites then the movie had all black people. foh, stfu.
i vaguely remember watching the wiz movie at a young age bc michael jackson was in it & he's my dad's favourite music artist
There are no strong voices on the new The Wiz movie. It's not gonna be nowhere near as good as the original
the wiz actually used my favorite movie because of how much I love michael jackson

The Wiz should've been done movie style with top name celebrities.
OMG I'm watching the wiz it's such a beautiful movie
White people can't be mad that the cast of The Wiz is all black when they used nothing but white people in a movie about Moses
It's a remake of THE WIZ the movie made in 1978.. It's not about black or white. This is huge for us. Leave us alone!
Watching THE Wiz, the movie now, on @AspireTV so that I can practice the songs before the live show.
I will be tuned in to the wiz tonight! They better do well too because the movie is a classic.
It's literally going to take everything in me to not compare The Wiz Live with the original movie & the play.
Smh people are sooooo annoying the Wiz was originally an all black movie with Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. Smh do research
I'm so ready for the Wiz!! My fave movie!!!
The Wiz always been my favorite movie since I was a yb
I hope negros don't try to compare the Wiz Live to the movie. Theatre & motion pictures are different animals with their own breath & depth

#DearFutureWife we could watch the Wiz tonight together, drink hot chocolate, but you haven't seen the original movie with Michael & Diana!
My thoughts when watching the wiz I will not compare it to #TheWiz movie it's a stage play. #broadway #TheWizLive pic.twitter.com/OWL04wAloy
I'm so ready for The Wiz!! I understand it's the play not the movie. So it will still be new to me!!
Definitely gonna watch The Wiz with my baby,she loves the original movie...
A lot of people will watch the wiz live tonight but have never seen the movie!!! Please watch it #DianaRoss #MichaelJackson
White people are mad about a Broadway play and movie that are both 40 years old, called The Wiz because #TheWizLive is on tonight
Texted my oldest niece to remind her about The Wiz tonight and she thanked me for showing her the movie as a kid and now I'm bawling.
"The Wiz" movie was way better than "The Wizard of Oz". Is that why you really mad?? You're mad that black people make things pop?
White people really didn't know "The Wiz" was a movie?! Prolly because Michael Jackson was black then....
WHAT WHITE PEOPLE ARE PISSED THAT A BLACK MOVIE HAS AN ENTIRELY BLACK CAST YOU D O KNOW THE WIZ IS L I TE R A L L Y A BLACK MOVIE RIGHT
Soooo, people are (idiotically) mad at The Wiz, but cool with making a movie about Mosses with nothing but White people sans servants etc?
Soooo excited to watch #TheWizLive tonight considering the Wiz is my all time favorite movie
@rodimusprime 72 AfrAms haven't seen the Wiz? Like, even the movie?
At the gym today I listened to the OBC recording of The Wiz, then the movie soundtrack and then songs from tonight's show...
For the people that think The Wiz is racist there was a movie called The Wizard of Oz in 1939 w/ an all white cast...ding dongs.
So bummed I can't watch The Wiz Live...live. Loved the movie as a kid and used 2 run around singing "You can't wiiiiiin...". Huh. Still do.
In preparation for #TheWizLive @officialwizlive tonight I listened to the Wiz Bway CD, Wizard of Oz Movie & Tour & Wicked! Ready and excited
I got a question for some of you simple minded Racist Muthafuggaz....Why was the movie and play The Wiz was... http://fb.me/4TMqKH0yj 
@berngiacomazzo definitely...when I first heard NBC was doing The Wiz I was a lil put off by it cause of how good the movie was
@berngiacomazzo @miamckenzie umm the ALL WHITE version of The Wiz is The Wizard of Oz. It was a broadway play, then a movie.. Google it!
I'm watching the original The Wiz movie right now and it's still good money...got the live NYC play on record for later viewing
I think I might watch the movie version of The Wiz before the live show. Or vice versa. Stephanie Mills was DIVINE.
FIRST off Yall a little bit way too late,the movie, "The Wiz" came out in the 1970 With MJ & Diana Ross, So y'all should have been boohoo'd
So white people are mad that "The Wiz" live show tonight has an All Black CAST ? Clearly the haven't seen the movie then
REAKING NEWS: So apparently White people calling us Racist because they remade the movie "The Wizard of Oz" to "The Wiz" . Ouuu how racist
just a heads up: The wiz the play and and the wiz the movie are two totally different things.
@lovelygurl456 or the movie the wiz was crafted after for that matter.

Okae the original movie the Wiz came out in 1978.... I was seven years old when I saw it. I'm excited about this new version. #TheWizLive

#Dearwhitepeople The reason the Wiz has all Black cast is because The Wizard of Oz, the movie it’s adapted from, was ALL WHITE
@TylishaHaskins ehhh. The wiz is an actual musical that was on broadway. Wizard of oz was a movie with music.
I can't wait to see how the Wiz Live will be tonight !!! LIVE SHOW Not Recorded as a MOVIE !!!!!

The Wiz is finally coming on tonight. that's my favorite movie so I know tonight's about to be good.
Calling "the wiz" racist when it's a historically black movie, a reverse of the historically all white "wizard of oz". Ignorance
White people complainin bout The Wiz like the original movie ain't been out for over 30 years. It's already a thing bae get over it.
God bless all of the white people who have never seen the movie "The Wiz" and will be experiencing its greatness for the 1st time tonight

"The Wiz" is a historical black movie! There will never be an all white cast of the film. EVER. Please start thinking before speak.
any The Wiz movie without Michael Jackson and Diana Ross is something we simply can not acknowledge.
The WIZ is OUR (the black culture) interpretation of the movie & the #WIZlive is basically a remake of the movie. Enlighten yourself pls
People are so dumb talking about they mad it's an all black cast for The Wiz! Live. Well idiots the movie The Wiz was an all black cast!!!!
The Wiz is a black movie.. That is why it was made. That is why there is an all-black cast.
My favorite movie of ALL TIME ..... Tonight I'm locked in! The Wiz, LIVE @ 8:00! #epic https://www.instagram.com/p/-2HObCDyI2/

why people mad about the wiz having an all black cast...check this movie called the wizard of oz to see the all white cast #UrWelcome
So white people are upset that The Wiz is an all black cast? Did they see the movie The Wiz, or do they not even claim that one?
White people NEVER make it an issue when a show/movie is an all white cast. Now ya'll made because THE WIZ is all black? Gtfoh! #TheWiz

Reminder for The Wiz tonight: They are doing the Broadway show, not the movie. So like, Kansas not NYC.
I can't...... I cannot....... People are truly fools. The original movie of the Wiz is a classic, and was and... http://fb.me/3HNuvvcbf 
People that Its complaining about The Wiz clearly has never seen the movie with Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, etc.
Just saw that they are doing a live version of The Wiz based on the broadway show, hopefully that means it's good, unlike the movie...
Confession: I sincerely disliked the original 'The Wiz' movie because of Diana Ross. But I think tonight's version will be great.
The Wiz (movie) had actors such as Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne and Richard Pryor
Was there any outrage about 'The Sound of Music' or 'Peter Pan' as there is about 'The Wiz', which was a legit movie in the 70s?
I've never seen the movie The Wiz so this will all be new for me tonight. Very much interested.
I can't believe some people haven't seen The Wiz, that's like my family movie

"The Wizard of Oz" movie had an all white cast for those of you who are offended by the all black cast of "The Wiz"
@The Wiz was written for an all black cast. It's an urban version. Was first a bway show then a movie with Diana Ross, MJ, etc. stop it!
Watching The Wiz movie getting so excited for tonight!! Love live theater broadcast for millions of people. #TheWizLive
@BaelockHolmes because they are stupid. The wiz was written for an all black cast as a Broadway play. The movie was Diana and Michael.
The first movie "The Wiz" was all black w/ Mike jack....y'all wasn't sayin nothin or don't even know bout it now
Watching a movie on YouTube in class and The Wiz Live commercial came on and I squealed. Everyone looked at me like pic.twitter.com/p9wHKVnwcS
Also almost evry broadway musical&movie features an all-white cast. We shd celebrate the #wiz live, not berate it, explicitly bc of its cast
@chantellyyy it kills me. So many people don't know about the original movie "The Wiz" and didn't know Diana Ross or MJ was in it.
Are people upset about an all black cast for The Wiz?!! I think they forgot about the original movie that had Diana Ross and Michael Jackson
Confession: The Wiz movie creeps me out, but I'm excited to the see #TheWizLive tonight. http://fb.me/7Et3p7Pdj 
How is the wiz racist when the actual movie was an all black cast the wizard of oz was an all white cast tf ??
Wiypipo upset by the fact that they arent represented in The Wiz like the Wizard of Oz dont exist. Just like the Annie movie all over again
The Wiz Live is meant to be a modern, televised take on the BROADWAY PLAY . It's not meant to be like the movie.
That its racist because if there was a movie like the wiz full of white people it will cause an uproar. I'm laughing because they are -
@Getout_Stayout @miamckenzie @iamroxxyhaze And The Wiz was originally made in 1974, with a movie version in 1978. Your point?
People are mad at the cast of the wiz being all black.... Didn't you see the movie pic.twitter.com/FsOhg5TDdr
BITCH THE WIZ LIVE IS ALL BLACK CUZ THE MOVIE IS ACTUALLY ALL BLACK TF.
I refuse to believe that there's really people out there who didn't know that the wiz is a black movie lol......
@Dhalmel_NA dumb people tweeting about The Wiz not knowing it was a stage play and movie from the 70’s.
I'm excited to watch the wiz live , b/c it's a great movie #TheWiz
Do people not realize that #TheWizLive is based off The Wiz movie that was made in the 70's lol
I hope the same people upset by the cast of "The Wiz" are as equally offended by the cast for the upcoming "The Gods of Egypt" movie.
oh yes lets get it out now this version of the wiz WILL NOT BE LIKE THE MOVIE ..... so can we get out of our systems please
So why are people mad that its an ALL BLACK CAST for The Wiz.. Its based off an ALL BLACK MOVIE!!!!
All I care about is seeing my FAVORITE song from The Wiz, "No Bad News". It was the highlight of the movie.
Y'all really think the Wiz is a remake? The Wiz has always been a black movie. The wizard of Oz is all white. Dumbasses!!! #TheWizLive
Tonight's "The Wiz Live!" won't be made for TV Oz movie featuring Queen Latifah and David Alan Grier... http://fb.me/4QfVMUchS 
I'm white as wonder bread and even I know the Wiz isn't racist. If it is then the 1939 movie that had an all white cast is racist too.
Two standards: A: "This movie has an all-white cast." B: "So? Best people got the job." A: "The Wiz is all-black." B: "That's so racist!"
HA wait, are there really white people who are demanding a white version of The Wiz? Have they seen a little movie called The Wizard of Oz?
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/dslpHxTuA-w?a  The Wiz (8/8) Movie CLIP - Home (1978) HD
It'll be interesting to see if tonight's live version of The Wiz can be just as bloated and sloppy as the 70s movie was
All this The Wiz talk on my timeline! Yes I'm loving this. I may go ahead and watch the movie so I can see my fav couple!!!
I *really* hope #TheWizLive does justice to the original "The Wiz." That movie is so important to me.
i'm excited for the WIZ tonight. i love the movie as is. lol
Im gonna be at work when The Wiz comes on .... I literally wanna cry so bad cause thats my favorite movie
Best number in the whole damn movie "The Wiz (1/8) Movie CLIP - The Crow Anthem (1978) HD" https://youtu.be/3r1ssg1LIt4  via @YouTube
I'm really excited to see the wiz live lol. I loved that movie growing up
The Wiz is literally one of my favorite Broadway productions and movies ever. It was my go to movie as a kid.
. @bryansafi reminded me of the scariest movie of my childhood and I might have to rewatch tonight before The Wiz. pic.twitter.com/39mXZicmuD
I don't like the movie The Wiz but I really can't wait to see them do it live tonight the singing will be everythingggg
Dear White People: I hope you all know "The Wiz" is a remake of 1978 original classic. Also, you already have an all white cast of the movie
And does he not know there is an actual movie called The Wiz??? https://twitter.com/____panther/status/672478183883587584 …
The movie version of The Wiz is one of my all time favorites. I I know the words to every song. "What, what would I do if I could feel!"
@ShesDoingThings I can't believe I've never seen this movie. P.S. My dad was at Studio 54 on opening night of The Wiz on Broadway & saw MJ!
ok so, The Wiz Broadway production was in 1975.... the movie was released in 1978. this is not some new, random production. smh.
People need to stop hating on The Wiz's cast and at least watch the movie. Michael Jackson and Diana Ross had it LIT
lol Like a young MJ was in the movie The Wiz....Globally everyone knows who Micheal Jackson is how do ppl not know this ???
@YeahItsWilly @todo45 lol people really dont know that the "The Wiz" was an ALL black Broadway musical & movie??? #BeingCulturedMatters
My son always tries to do this. The wiz is his favorite movie lol https://twitter.com/callmedollar/status/672486073122033664 …
I liked a @YouTube video http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/KgScH … The Wiz (5/8) Movie CLIP - No Bad News (1978) HD
but that's all, just how i feel. ️ the wiz is a classic, so many greats in that movie. hope y'all watch it & understand my love for it
Like be serious! There's a movie coming out about Egyptian God's with an all white cast. I think you guys can let us have The Wiz! IJS
those people complaining about an all black cast of the wiz must have never saw the 1st movie.
@bloggedyourmom The Wiz musical is a remake of the movie The Wiz (1978) which was a remake of The Wizard of Oz which had an all-white cast.
So white people really getting mad about The Wiz? A movie that's been out for 30+ years.... When The Wizard of Oz had an all white cast too?
As a kid, The Wiz may have played in my house more than any other movie.
It's a real shame that people don't know The Wiz was a very successful Broadway play 3 years before the movie came out.
The Wiz live is based on the stage play, despite everyone bringing up the cult favorite movie.
Including the movie the wiz is directly based on
I worked really hard on that "The Wiz" review. I hope you all watch tonight so you can see how little the musical resembles the movie.
The Wiz premiered on Broadway in late 1974. It was, then, turned into a movie in 1978. It's not anything new.
Don't forget about that movie where whites were castes as Egyptians and whites said we aren't defined by color...what's wrong with The Wiz?
"Why can the wiz have a black cast but we can't have movies with an all white cast???" Um have you seen any movie ever made before 1960
@QuaishaunC @BlackBeauty504 the wiz the original play was 1975. This is the 40 year anniversary. Movie was 1978.
Did some Dedicated art from the 1978 movie The Wiz The Crows 'You can't Win' Done By yours truly pic.twitter.com/j4bMeAm6cP
@shgmclicious I mean they need to get over it "The Wiz" is a black movie. We aren't asking to change "Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"
THE DOLLY PRTON MOVIE DOESN'T COME ON TILL THE 10TH?!? oh well I'm still excited for the wiz
@thatgurlshay100 @KevXIndy the ORIGINAL is the all white 1939 The wizard of Oz 2nd the all black broadway the wiz 3rd the movie the wiz
I liked a @YouTube video http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/5G5tR … The Wiz (1/8) Movie CLIP - The Crow Anthem (1978) HD
@ LRT. For real tho how have you lived this long and not know that The Wiz is an adaption of the original movie The Wizard of Oz. How?
The Wiz will be on NBC. Last time it was on a network station was when the movie played on CBS years ago.
As a WRITER I am a movie buff in the THE WIZ my favorite line is WIZ: N what do U want? LION: 2 GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE!
Okay but The Wiz was a movie that my dad forced me to watch when I was like 9 or something bc I had only seen Wizard of Oz
I will troll everybody that tries to compare The Wiz Live to the movie The Wiz. No idiocy allowed tonight.
There's not a way to get NBC in the school so we can't watch The Wiz Live tonight. We will watch a movie in the classroom. Sorry.
The subway scene scared me to death as a child so The Wiz movie was never a fav for me.
Did some people fall asleep when The Wiz had the movie and the Broadway show? How are people so mad about it? Bunch of dummies
People who are complaining about The Wiz are probably too young to know that a little movie called Wizard of Oz exists.
The Wiz won 7 of the 8 Tony awards it was nominated for. The movie did nothing to take from that https://twitter.com/nprmonkeysee/status/672431106789089281 …
White ppl mad bcus the wiz live is an all black cast but the 1978 movie the wiz is all black too LMFAO. This not the wizard of oz df
People complaining about the Wiz cast being all black like the movie The Wizard of Oz wasn't all white.. who cares.
For those of you unacquainted with the The Wiz, you're missing out. Here's a song/moment from the 1978 movie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8Hab0memi4 …
Slim the Wiz was a key part of my youth. Know that whole movie word for word.
Join me in live-tweeting The Wiz Live! Follow #JonesingForTheWiz for cool tidbits about the original production and movie!
The Wizard of Oz is favorite movie ever but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate The Wiz! Different isn't wrong it's just different.
@tearsandteeth I recall Harlan Ellison spoke of hearing a studio exec in the 80s suggest someone do a movie of The Wiz's story, but white.
@halliefayexo I think this is more of a remake of a remake? I think The Wiz was a movie in the 70s?
#TheWiz '75 Broadway Show and The Wiz '78 movie are really almost two completely separate things. #TheWizLive
I'm so excited to watch The Wiz Live tonight!! If they're singing the songs from the movie, I'm definitely gettin on the fam's nerves lol.
(The Wiz (8/8) Movie CLIP - Home (1978) HD) One of my favorite scenes. http://youtu.be/dslpHxTuA-w 
Can't judge blackness off of seeing a movie but EVERY black person has to see the Wiz.
The Wiz was my 1st musical/movie at a theater - remember it vividly (Moma be knowing). So excited about it modern day. Dope Black Excellence
I'm super excited for The Wiz tonight!!! I get so hype for the live musicals on TV. I've never actually seen the show OR the movie either so
Are they showing The Wiz movie today before the Live show? #TheWiz
THE WIZ FACTS: The '78 movie set the real-world action in NYC, whereas the broadway show was still set in Kansas like the book. #TheWizLive
I can understand people not realizing The Wiz was an actual movie but did they just forget that The Wizard of Oz was a thing???
Anybody that know me know I go hard behind The Wiz… I hate when everything Is about race either u going to watch the movie or you not..DAMN
Is it just me or has The Wiz always seemed like a strange name for a movie? #movie
#tbt The Wiz! I love this movie!!!! I knew every word to every song! Needless to say I will… https://www.instagram.com/p/-1ju9uIPER/ 
If u haven't seen the Wiz movie try to catch it before the new live show comes on tonight. It's incredible. Costumes, dancing, evrythng
I never liked "The Wiz" i always feel asleep on it. But if you piece together what i saw, I'm sure I've seen the whole movie.
FIRST OF ALL The Wiz the movie literally came out in 1978 and flopped bc it was an all-black cast and it literally had all LEGENDS in it
People really mad cause The Wiz is all black .. Have yal not seen the movie? Probably not i guess ..
@TonyaGJPrince I grew up watching the original Wizard of Oz film EVERY DAY, it was my favorite movie. I also love The Wiz. What a concept
Did some of those ppl who criticized 'The Wiz' for having an all black cast not remember the the cast of the original movie?
The Wiz has always had an all-black cast. Did yall not see the movie?
THE WIZ FACT: The Wiz is based off the 1900 novel by L. Frank Baum NOT the 1939 MGM movie w/Judy Garland. #TheWizLive #TheWiz
For starters, THIS IS THE WIZ!!!!! NOT THE WIZARD OF OZ!!! THE ORGINA WIZ HAD AN ALL BLACK CAST AS WELL. WAYCH THE DAMN MOVIE
Don't know if I can see The Wiz tonight without judging it to death. Diana Ross & Michael Jackson in the '78 movie, classic.
@domgirlsays The all white production is called The Wizard of Oz. The Wiz is a movie spawned from the original. I mean like...Google?
The wiz was an African American movie https://twitter.com/_fuckdev/status/672448218119172096 …
I watched The Wiz on HBO so many times, as a kid, I forgot it was based on another movie. I want to watch it tonight, but, live tv?!
The WIZ the movie on @bouncetv this Saturday! https://twitter.com/bouncetv/status/672446732505059328 …
Confession: The Wiz movie creeps me out, but I'm excited to the see The Wiz Live tonight. http://fb.me/7E1EfDMo4 
The Wizard Of Oz is my favorite movie.. I respect The Wiz, but I don't think I'm here the "The Wiz Live!" It's like a wait and see thing
My favorite movie is the wiz so they better had did a good job with this damn remake.
Movie=The Wizard of Oz=All white cast. Movie Musical=The WIZ=All black cast. Inept assclowns pls know your cinema history. #TheWIZ
&honestly even if the wiz wasn't based off an all white casted movie. So the fuck what. How often do you see anything all black? Stop hating
Too much going on tonight! I have a movie date but the game is tonight and The Wiz comes on
I need to watch the wiz tonight, my parents' first date was to see the movie in theaters, I might not be here if it weren't for that.
The movie "The Wiz" was legit my favorite movie as a kid ! Same with Annie lol
The Wiz (3/8) Movie CLIP - Ease on Down the Road (1978) HD can't wait till tonight The Wiz Live!!! http://youtu.be/oGxBx8RzzrM 
If you don't like musicals or plays...your opinion on the wiz is not needed...it won't be anything like the movie, please know this.
So hype about The Wiz. I LOVE the wiz. I got the movie on Laserdisc and the broadway soundtrack on vinyl THIS AINT A GAME
how are people just realizing The Wiz is an old ass movie and has always had an all black cast..?¿
Every time the wiz is brought someone always say how bad the movie looked compared to the wizard of oz
Of course I saw the Wizard of oz before I saw the Wiz, and to see this black rendition of the movie, I was just amazed.
PSA for today, The Wiz was actually a Broadway musical before being made into a movie in the 70s. Get this, it is based off a book, lol.
So white folks mad bout #TheWiz tonight being all black; ignorin the fact #WizardofOz was all white & The Wiz was an actual movie first
Something in my spirit just cannot see it for The Wiz (movie). I hear the stage play it's based on is everything.
And The Wiz movie got terrible reviews when it came out. At this very moment it has only a 30% rating on Rotten Tomatoes
Tf it's the wiz the movie version was an all black cast so why tf would live be anything different? Y'all got y'all wizard of oz live wit it
It would be great if THE WIZ LIVE managed to undo some of what I think happened to that show as a result of the movie not being great.
The Wiz was an exceptional play and later movie that was inspirational and fun. That is why we are beyond excited... http://fb.me/Wq3MAYjX 
I'll watch the wiz live tonight, but it's not gonna be better than the original movie
True RT @SKEJayRogers: The Wiz is a trash movie tho. The songs were dope tho.
The Wiz Live tonight on NBC. Growing up, the movie "The Wiz" was one of my favorites. Words can… https://www.instagram.com/p/-1WvmSyIku/ 
@KevXIndy the original "The Wiz" movie is a masterpiece.
Lol I dont even fuckin think The Wiz is gonna be good. I got my Diana Ross The Wiz and I’m conpletely fine with that 1000 year old movie.
What the fuck is The Wiz anyway? Is it a Wiz Khalifa movie?
The Wiz Movie CLIP - If You Believe (1978) HD #HeadphonesOverHumans http://youtu.be/DHzx2P4x63c 
The Wiz is definitely the diverse version of The Wizard of Oz what is the complaint about? People act like it's not already a movie out!
So @GloballyNomad has never seen the wiz movie so he'll be watching tonight like: pic.twitter.com/KX0CcNaXYv
Wow some people really have never heard of "The Wiz" movie by Berry Gordy featuring Michael Jackson. Well I can't be too surprised
@KevXIndy U don't have 2 keep apologizing! We ALL make errors PS The Wiz movie was w/MJ The Wiz musical is different than the film. #Respect
The Wiz that’s on tonight is based on the stage play/Broadway play NOT the movie so keep that in mind before you all get judgey -k-
Lt. me warn y'all about The Wiz: this is the stage version. Don't expect the movie Wiz movie.
The Wiz was a great interpretation of a classic movie.
Are there any TV networks airing The Wiz (movie) in honor of #TheWizLive special tonight? @TVGuide
I hope #TheWizLive does The Wiz justice. Because, honestly I only regard that movie. No love for The Wizard Of Oz from me.
@scandalmonium @Popeassociate @M2THRU @SherlanPW @1970poet Wait, what movie? The Wizard of Oz? Noooo, really? Or the original The Wiz?
The Wiz, a live Broadway play airs on NBC at 8pm. What’s your favorite throwback play/movie? #Local4Today pic.twitter.com/FyUGSffbZY
watchin The Wiz this my top 3 of all time everytime i see it its like its a new movie to me
lmao do ppl not know the wizard of oz n the wiz are not even the same movie https://twitter.com/iamroxxyhaze/status/672262915953561604 …
Idc what anyone says. If The Wiz can cast this many black ppl in one movie in the 1970s, then there shouldn't be a problem now.....
so thrilled for The Wiz Live! tomorrow. Grew up with the movie starring Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor, and so many more...
If u listen 2 the Broadway version of The Wiz vs. movie version, you realize Quincy Jones reallyyyy improved the production. But that's it.
The Wiz is really my favorite movie, I used to watch it once a week...I was in the school play in middle school
We don't need another: The wiz, Friday, Jurassic park, James Bond movie, Annie, Carrie, TAKEN, scary Christmas move, Fast & Furious
Real talk, I was gonna rent The Wiz (movie) tonight. Now I just want to cry while cussing someone out. #SanBernadino Oh ok, just me huh? :-?
cause all the characters in the WofO are white and the wiz is an black movie. This is a remake to the classic https://twitter.com/CarliLease_4/status/661547310585917444 …
@KevXIndy FWIW, before Motown made a movie, The Wiz was a highly acclaimed show on Broadway. @PrettyMill1 was the original Dorothy and...
Watching the wiz with my mama this our favorite movie
The Wiz with Michael Jackson was poppin . If you are a black and never saw that movie your childhood was trash & im sorry .
Lol mfs was on so much dirt with @KevXIndy about The Wiz. Lol he hella didn't know the movie existed. I know some black people who don't.
They better do the wiz justice. It was such an amazing movie and I'm mad I never got to see the Broadway production with Stephanie mills
IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN 'THE WIZ' STAGE PLAY OR THE MOVIE & YOU OFFER UP AN OPINION TOMORROW/FRIDAY ILL BLOCK YOU. #DoYaResearch #AskYaMomma

Wait. The Wiz is going to be on TV tomorrow? The movie was the first musical I liked as a kid. Better find my remote.
@skhoss Pssst! It's based on a Broadway play turned movie called "The Wiz". Let Google be your friend

The Wizard of Oz is my favorite movie of all time & I have ZERO interest in watching "The Wiz" play or whatever on tv #dontmesswaclassic

Ok ,I must say I am Mad !!!Why didn't the just make the WIZ the movie and put the right people in it ? Dorothy... http://fb.me/M0OOsUsu 
@KevXIndy Sir, the original THE WIZ started on Broadway in 1975, three years before the MJ/Miss Ross movie. Stephanie Mills was Dorothy.
Can't wait to watch The Wiz live..... YES I will be watching. I loved that movie when I was a kid.

OK, "The Wiz" was a terrible idea as a movie in 1978. I wanna meet the guys who thought it was a good idea for live TV in 2015.
I wonder how many folks have zero clue that The Wiz was actually a movie starring Michael Jackson? #TheWizLive
Just so y'all know The Wiz Live is based off the Broadway show not the movie, which came before the movie

So, in honor of the Wiz Live on Thursday I'm gonna watch the movie. Its been YEARS since I watched it, so we'll see how this goes.
I love that this Making of The Wiz Live special acts like the 1978 movie was anything but a massive failure, critically and financially.

Let me just get some thoughts out before I see the Wiz Live--here's why The Wiz (movie) was pure magic for my generation:
This girl got me flustered as hell talm bout The Wiz was a weak ass movie.
The WIZ - A Brand New Day (Movie Version) - #Luther http://ht.ly/Vdwoz 
"The Wiz" Movie clip - 'Home' (1978) https://youtu.be/dslpHxTuA-w  My favorite number from the film. Diana Ross puts her heart & soul into it.
We were looking to watch The Wiz on YouTube and found that someone remade the entire movie on the Sims 2! So entertaining!
No one is trying to take away the classic Wizard of Oz, this cast is just laying tribute to the former The Wiz cast and movie
I understand that the live The Wiz is in or will be coming but y'all late.... The Wiz was the best movie of the 70s/80s. Diana and Mike
@dmoneyinthecutt @90s_Jess not even just that but The Wiz was originally black anyway its a different movie from the Wizard of Oz
@ReaganGomez yes. My parents didn't expose me to much as a child but I'm thankful that The Wiz was probably the 1st movie I ever saw.
did this feminist person make the wiz a political movie ...yes yes she did smh
If you have never seen The Wiz the movie or Broadway show with Stephanie Mills you are missing out on a piece of entertainment magic #TheWiz
I'm probably the only one who thought The Wiz was an okay movie. The live musical on Thursday has potential though

@sylphanne @90s_Jess @MissZindzi totally different movie. It's called an adaptation. Thats why it's the wiz not the wizard of oz
We're watching the movie version of the Wiz. I gotta make sure my nieces and nephew hold on to their black card..
I'm gonna be honest, except for MJ, I didn't really like the movie The Wiz

LMAO ppl think'g The Wiz (movie) wz the original! #TheWizLive is the 2nd gen of the Bway musical from 1975. pic.twitter.com/gULusnwo6P
@WaltzingMtilda My fave movie of all time is Wizard of Oz so you can imagine my displeasure. The Wiz is the JarJarBinks of Oz. @kspetzman
Nah I'm actually way too hype to see the wiz live next week on nbc.....like the wiz was my movie
@MadeirosScott ....have you seen the original "the wiz"? And in that case I guess the Wizard of Oz movie was racist to blacks huh

"Is this an ad for the new Star Wars movie?" -my dad upon seeing a commercial for "The Wiz Live".
So far during this NFL game, NBC has advertised The Wiz remake & the Dolly Parton movie. Way to know your demo guys...
But truly, if you've never seen The Wiz, you are missing out on a GENIUS movie and musical. Michael Jackson! Diana Ross!
man you can’t tell me that “the wiz” was wack. whole soundtrack was whole movie was
Sooooo full from dinner gonna watch my favorite movie ever, "The Wiz" later tonight
@HardlyCivilized the wiz was a movie made in the 70's and it has an all black cast. This one is a remake
LOL ppl think'g The Wiz (movie) wz the original!!!! @BroadwayBlack @makingthewiz #TheWiz pic.twitter.com/yCgUJEFNJo
Bruh that The Wiz live movie they doing on TV looks horrible
The Wiz is my favorite movie ever.
The Wiz is such a good movie <3 #thewiz
@ASweetTweetRose oops, sorry! Its from the musical movie, The Wiz :)
I absolutely positively hate the movie "The Wiz". That movie/musical is horrible. Messing up the Wizard of Oz like that.

The Emerald City scene in The Wiz is nothing but BLACK EXCELLENCE. I love this movie.
"The Wiz" is a new version of "The Wizard Of Oz" with POC playing all the main parts, and it looks miles better than the original movie.
The Wiz is on classic Thanksgiving movie
Naw yo if I was high watching the wiz ill be cdfu through the whole movie
Cleaning up & watching "The Wiz." Amazing holiday movie. A timeless classic. Allstar cast featuring… https://instagram.com/p/-jmu5biLDQ/ 
Stephanie mills is going to be in the wiz live, she new Michael because they worked together in the movie She has been doin this for a while
The Wiz is a great movie
Watching The Wiz I love the movie and the Broadway musical
The Wiz is on TV One. I'm actually gonna make myself watch the whole movie this time.
To this day I have to say the move "THE WIZ" worst damn movie ever made!! Holiday classic to some, annoying mess to me..awful. lol
I think we watch the wiz every thanksgiving my absolute favorite movie.
The Wiz is on. I've never seen the whole movie. Some parts scare me & I usually fall asleep b/c it's so long! #sayimnottheonlyone
The Wiz is like the best movie ever forget the wizard of oz
Each one teach one: as we watch The Wiz Live as a family Wednesday; please tell a neighbor it is based on the PLAY not the MOVIE.
the wiz is my fav movie and it is on right now thank you god
My favorite movie of all times is on !!! " THE WIZ"
#ICYM The movie “The Wiz” it is coming back on now starring #MichaelJackson x #DianaRoss!
One plus to my morning is that the wiz is on my favorite movie
What a better way to start out my thanksgiving than with my favorite movie of all time? The wiz Duh
We done with the Macy's parade. We seen the wiz preview and now we gotta watch the original movie.
The Wiz is my favorite movie in the entire world. Such feels
Berry Gordy's insistence on Diana Ross playing Dorothy in movie version of The Wiz ruined that film. Stephanie Mills was born 4 that role
"This is sort of like the 'Annie' movie." - my 6-year-old niece about "The Wiz". No comment. #MacysParade
The the wiz movie is coming on tonight. Idc if I did watch it last night
up early watching the original The Wiz movie... watching the emerald city color change scene NEVER gets old, love the romance
Feeling some kind of way about this The Wiz Live show coming, esp since it will be based on Broadway musical not the movie.
Confession: I tried to watch the original movie The Wiz. I only lasted about 30 minutes. I just couldn't get into it.
Weirdly enough the Wiz movie was one of my childhood favorites - nbc please don't mess it up like Peter Pan last year
NBC is really ramping up their December content, huh? The Wiz and a DOLLY PARTON MOVIE!?! I die. #MacysParade
@SaxAddict95 I grew up with The Wiz lol I didn't even know there was a Wizard of Oz until middle school. We need a movie night ASAP.

I grew up watching The Wiz. It was my favorite movie as a child.

The Wiz is my favorite movie but it sort of creeps me out lol.

The Wiz (the bdway show and Diana Ross movie), while based on/influenced by The Wizard of Oz, WERE NOT (are not) The Wizard of Oz
why are all these mainstream (read: white) outlets whitesplaining what The Wiz Live is by comparing it to 1939 The Wizard of Oz movie? sigh.

Still suprised how some people didn't know the movie " The Wiz " was an actual thing.
The commercials for The Wiz Live got me wanting to watch the movie now. Guess listening to the soundtrack will have to do.
