Bajirao Mastani movie review: Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh film ends up being a costume drama http://ift.tt/1QtimpB 
I want a love made for movie screens
I'm excited for the next movie. I want more light saber battles.
Here's our movie review of #StarWarsTheForceAwakens http://gizmo.do/x1LMXgR  Do you agree or disagree?
... that Steven brought up his upcoming movie Extraction starring Bruce Willis & asked if I would play his son. https://twitter.com/imdb/status/677951622744420352 …
I was meeting Steven C Miller for lunch in hopes that he would direct my movie The Fued and we had such a bromance.. https://twitter.com/imdb/status/677951622744420352 …
Just got goosebumps watching the #TheForceAwakens trailer...and I've already seen the movie!
I'm so proud that this was just named the most romantic movie of 2015 https://youtu.be/tD6EpcjS5wQ 
I remember the 1st #StarWars movie like it was yesterday. I was only 58! Just a kid enjoying a movie lol.
If I'm watching Civil War and someone shouts "LANGUAGE" during my paid, long awaited movie experience... Oooh lord. https://twitter.com/wookiee582/status/677941231511404544 …
"I will deal with ISIS I promise, but first I have to go watch a space movie." - @POTUS
At the end of the day I loved most of the movie but feel betrayed and depressed by Han and Leia's miserable backstory. They deserved better.
I didn't have any of the movie spoiled for me, but it still upsets me that people are posting them. I will continue to block you if you do.
This time tomorrow, my fam & I'll be sitting in assigned seats in the movie theatre 2C #StarWarsTheForceAwakens! pic.twitter.com/pcltzm4j96
I'm almost as excited as Yoda for this movie. #StarWarsTheForceAwakens pic.twitter.com/ygmR3vJWpq
btw I am legitimately TRIGGERED by the wilhelm scream. I can't remember the 20 minutes of the movie that came after it

New kabit movie: I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus Starring Anne Curtis Derek Ramsay Santa Claus
If you spoil a movie I think it should be an automatic death penalty, but that's just me.
#StarWarsTheForceAwakens is the movie I'd been waiting for since sitting on the theater floor at age 10 for #ReturnOfTheJedi. I loved it.
K: My Chinese isn't that good but I hope to learn some through the filming of this movie & future activites here. pic.twitter.com/CjDv1nz17q
Saw #BajiraoMastani & I'm speechless with the vision and passion this man called #SanjayLeelaBhansali has made this mammoth movie. Bravo!
K getting back off Twitter to avoid little virgins tweeting spoilers. That's why I didn't tweet much yesterday. I'll return after the movie.
Met on some TV properties yesterday. 2 more movie scripts arrived I have to read today. Big maze slate meeting at the end of the day.
I enjoyed that new Space Battles movie! Every scene was like, "More crazy-looking creature extras?" And I was like, "Yes, please!"
i have so much homework what movie should i watch
I love a good movie poster. And in 2015, there were at least 25 of them. http://www.ew.com/gallery/best-and-worst-movie-posters-2015 … via @DarrenFranich pic.twitter.com/esBbUUqQ4h
St @Gurmeetramrahim GURUJI..I m keenly waiting 4 Ur upcoming movie..& I m sure that only Online Gurukul can reach over & above #MSG2in453 !
ry: bae i have something to confess, idk how to say this but well... ive never seen a single starwars movie seb:
I think that Star Trek movie looks like a lot of fun, but they probably should've dressed the cast up as '70s cop show cops.
#MSG2in453 I have never seen too much craze for @MSGTheFilm !!! Must watch Trailer of Block buster movie MSG2 !! https://youtu.be/2OxIWWcPgxc

i just watched the big movie sitting next to a real large fella wearing a bill murray hoodie over a bill murray tshirt. what an honor

@Gurmeetramrahim I've never seen such prolonged craze for any movie. Kudos to You Rockstar Saint! #MSG2in453 pic.twitter.com/9dwAR1G7if
What's everyone up to this weekend? I've still got my Dad here.I think it's a movie marathon weekend. Starting with Thanga Magan of course!
About to put on a movie and sleep I think! See you all tomorrow. GOODNIGHT <3
I know there's some movie opening today, but there's also this pic.twitter.com/FqbKOkxM6r
I still can't sleep after seeing that movie
A very typical, old, Bollywood, Masala movie, nothing new. #Dilwale Some parts are boring. I'll give 1.5 out of 5. pic.twitter.com/BC7RVvzeWj
No spoilers, I promise. All I will say, is that the movie has been over for 20 minutes and I have not said one word. I am speechless.
Just look at @iamsrk's TL .. And Look at @BeingSalmanKhan's TL when His Movie releases.. PROUD TO BE A FAN OF A GENUINE MEGASTAR SALMAN KHAN
-And when did you decide to start therapy? -After realizing my entire body shuts down if someone I like doesn't like the movie I like.
The one thing I'll say (after I loved it) is I was concerned Ren would be a shallow Darth knockoff and he's the best character in the movie
Not even having the movie spoiled for me could take away from how much I loved watching The Force Awakens. Everything I wanted it to be.
#MSG2in453 I have never ever seen such kind of craze for inspirational movie with social messages ...but its true!! pic.twitter.com/kM3FL8uYlZ

So all of the #StarWarsTheForceAwakens comments I'm seeing r only "best movie ever" or "worse than Ep 1." Only a sith deals in absolutes.

Phenomenal. Legit might be the best movie I have ever seen in my life. @starwars #starwars
I can't believe Jar Jar Binks plays every character in the new Star Wars movie.
Experienced #BajiraoMastani yestereve. A movie I can watch over and over again. Every frame is a poem. Please do watch. #NotToBeMissed
I honestly can't stop crying thinking about little girls going to see this movie. If it meant this much to me at 27, I can't imagine
I always plan really cute movie nights with myself but then I fall asleep
If I see someone tweet about Star Wars & ruining the movie before I see it, I will fight you.
Everyone's pumped about the Star Wars movie and I've never seen a single one of 'em...yeah I said it
I can't imagine how packed every movie theater is right now for Star Wars.

Kind people are gently reassuring me that the new SW movie is good. YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND. I LIKE ALMOST NOTHING. I STRUGGLE TO FIND JOY.
You know, it's fun when a movie like #StarWarsTheForceAwakens comes out, because I get to relax and just be a fanboy myself. :D
I'm pumped for yall to see this movie
I've seen the movie and I'm still avoiding spoilers.

………… I’ve never seen one Star Wars movie. That feels good to get off my chest. Be gentle. I will watch eventually.
I have avoided #StarWarsTheForceAwakens spoilers for over a year and I feel like an 80's movie cop on his last day before retirement.

Is the star wars movie out? Do I have to watch previous sequels to understand it?
Brazil shutting off WhatsApp is so odd. They should have watched that Terry Gilliam future dystopia movie - I forget what it’s called.
I'm baffled by how I have tickets for the 17th for a movie "opening" on the 18th, that apparently everyone in my feed has seen already.
"Gone Girl" the movie was very intense...man I can't imagine
New @starwars Movie is GREAT !! Recommended. I will say no more !! Bri
I am gonna #BoycottDilwale not to make the movie flop but coz I don't agree with the views of @iamsrk and he has hurt the image of India!

Can't believe cassette tapes are back. Good thing I held onto all my old ones. What you know about that "A Goofy Movie" soundtrack???
I hate when I try to talk to people about Alf the lovable mischievous alien & they think I'm talking about Elf the overrated Christmas movie
I'm freaking excited for the new Star Wars movie!!

Can I go to sleep and wake up in a theatre with the new Star Wars movie starting pls thx u
If I ever come up with a count of zero, it's because the movie is British and I switch to "how many of these actors were in Harry Potter?"
Every time I watch a movie, I do a mental count of "how many of these actors were in a Marvel or DC movie?"
Thank you @CriticsChoice for the nomination for best actress in a movie made for television -I'm so honored @nbc
It all just hit me that I'm seeing a new Star Wars movie tonight and I can no longer function... but I really need to be functional today.
The way you feel about this new Star Wars movie is the way I feel about Vanderpump Rules every single week
I'm perfectly happy being single until I see a happy couple, a romantic movie, or when I listen to love songs.
All I want is a Spice World type movie but with Little Mix, is that too much to ask?
I'm out of popcorn. - me, before the movie starts.
Unbelievable, but true. I was just given a copy of the new #StarWars movie on DVD by George Lucas HIMSELF. Pretty cool. Can't wait to watch!

I rather cuddle and watch a movie with you, instead of going out to a party.
#Dilwale is SRK's worst movie ever. I've seen adverts with better acting. His downfall has begun. #earlyscreening
Falling asleep watching the Godzilla movie from 1998. One of my favorite movies as a kid. Probably seen it 50+ times.
If someone shoots up a movie theater while Star Wars 7 is playing, I hope they wear a Stormtrooper costume so they don't hit anyone.

Sadly I haven't been excited for a movie release to the point where it drives me to want and need to see it in theaters in a very long time.
sometimes i wish ratatouille was the only movie
Watching Jingle All the Way for the first time since I was a kid, and just realised that the giant fighty Santa is the Big Show! Best movie.
Introducing @petesjams to the movie 'All I Want For Christmas'! One of my favourites because the kids remind me of myself and @tommcfly !
I am writing a song called "Ben Roethlisberger's Breath." Also have optioned the movie rights.
My husband is blaring "Footloose" while I'm watching football. *writes movie "100 ways to die while annoying your wife"
I am LOVIN THIS CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY!!! Daddio is 92 and a terrific spunk!! Does everything himself and still looks like a damn movie star!
Our car now looks as though it's been in a Die Hard movie. If anyone else would to smash into it or use it in a ram raid I'm taking bookings
Pulp Fiction is probably the least talked about movie. I just never hear anyone mention it ever.
"I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her." The perfect (and perfectly awful) quote from a perfect Sunday movie.
Last movie, where is this quote from. "I see me... I see me too!"
I'd happily watch an eight hour Harry Potter movie if it meant that every single detail from the book was kept in.
For Colored Girls is one of those movies you watch once just to see what it's about I can't watch that movie again... Too sad
I'll wait until that new Star Wars movie shows up on Crackle.
#WhenICaught the Star Wars movie marathon, I can officially say I am ready for the new movie release! The Force Awakens will be epic!

I'm only medium into Star Wars, so this week is a win/win. Either the movie is good, or a bunch of nerds will cry, which is also good.
Sorry to burst your bubble but I haven't watched any Star Wars movie like ever .................. don't hate me
Wish I had someone to watch a Christmas movie with
I love how #MaryPoppins is such a great movie for kids but also has a deeper meaning for adults. They don't make 'em like they used to...
ROTJ is now my favorite movie of all time. In a few days, I'm going to see its sequel with my best friend and our significant others.
I wish my life was a christmas movie
In 1987 my neighbor gave me a box of Return of the Jedi toys & said "These are yours now." I went on to rent that movie until the tape died.

I feel like Gally was the unwanted but valid voice of reason in the first movie. Teresa plays that role in this movie. #survivethescorch
I feel like the beginning of this movie is basically the beginning of DEATH CURE. A little reordering was necessary. #survivethescorch
I love how this movie starts up right where the last one ended. #survivethescorch
"What are you in for?" "I robbed a bank at gunpoint. You?" "I curb-stomped a man who spoiled the new Star Wars movie." "Respect."

The best description of Donald Trump I ever heard was "he looks like the villain of a movie where the hero is a dog."
