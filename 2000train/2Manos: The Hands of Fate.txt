My own answer is Manos: The Hands of Fate. The MST3K episode around it was great, but the movie itself was still so bad it was stunning.
@AliceRadley If you want a really bad movie watch Manos The Hands of Fate
Just saw Manos: the Hands of Fate @FantasiaFest... worst movie ever! Not sure if should thank @synapsefilms for restoring this :P.

Watched "Manos": The Hands of Fate for the first time last night. I can see why it's called the worst movie ever. I lost the will to live.
@gregsestero The original legendary bad movie, "Manos: The Hands Of Fate".
@BigHeadSports Also, Manos: The Hands of Fate (not really, don't go anywhere near that movie)
Kiefer Sutherland has the best speaking cadence in this movie. he sounds like Torgo from manos, The Hands of Fate
At least Manos The Hands Of Fate has good lounge music. (The movie sucks though.)
I know the NBA Finals are on and all...but somehow I got sucked into MST3K Manos: The Hands of Fate. Such a terrible, terrible movie. Torgo!

Possibly unpopular opinion?: I absolutely think The Room is a worse movie than Manos: The Hands of Fate.
@MichaelLWhite My trainwreck movie of choice is Spice World, the Spice Girls movie. Also - Manos: The Hands of Fate.

@AliSilversmith @jkbeeler99 "Manos, the Hands of Fate" is the worst movie ever, with the possible exception of "Plan 9 from Outer Space".
Just to illustrate how bad I thought that movie was - I managed to watch "Manos: The Hands Of Fate" w/o being bored to sleep.
@werdstraws @hepgeek They're doing another Riff Trax live at Century in August. Manos The Hands of Fate, possibly the worst movie ever made.

I watched "Manos: The Hands of Fate" for Friday's #movie review #blog--it is definitely one of the #MoviesThatShouldBe3D

Elvira's Movie Macabre ~ Manos, the Hands of Fate on now.
This Weekend On Elvira's Movie Macabre, Manos: The Hands Of Fate!!!!
We're watching the 1st Transformers movie with #RiffTrax, but it's still an even more painful experience than "Manos: The Hands of Fate".
Oh oh!!! Manos: The hands of fate Special edition contains the MST3K and the original version of the movie... #mustnotspendmoney
Manos: The Hands of Fate In My Pants #improvefilmtitlesbyaddinginmypants (Also quite possibly the worst movie every made)
Attn Manos: The Hands Of Fate - your movie is actually devoid of movie. You re not actually a thing. Rectify this situation. Thanks.
Transformers 3 is the worst movie ive ever seen. Worse than Manos the hands of fate.save your money. Fuck you michael bey.sp?
Watching "Manos; The Hands of Fate" with @Huntermoseley, and he fell asleep within 2 minutes of the movie starting. #wow
I mean i would watch a syfy movie for the same reason i would watch manos: the hands of fate or megashark vs. Giant octopus. #schadenfreude
Couldn't make it ten minutes into the first #Transformers movie. Manos the Hands of Fate is better than this piece of garbage.
@cryingcrowgirl Aaaahh, I love bad movies! XD If you want to ever get a terrible movie going: Manos the Hands of Fate. #youmightdie
http://bit.ly/mRJtx1 Another awful awful movie, Manos: The Hands of Fate!
'Manos: The Hands of Fate' is the good kind of bad movie. 'Megashark vs. Crocosaurus' is the bad kind of bad movie.
The worst movie ever made is not Plan 9 from Outer Space, not Gigli, not Manos the Hands of Fate, not even Troll 2. It's Shakespeare in Love
Next band hangout night we need to have classic bad movie night and watch Manos: The Hands of Fate & Plan 9 from Outer Space :)
My video response to "So... Which movie is worst, Beverly Hills Cop 3 or Manos: The Hands of Fate?" #VYou http://vyou.com/a/510780
@YayeDozergirl es que neta esa movie esta horrible pero e visto peores ;D manos the hands of fate
No seriously. Real Steel looks like it might be on the level with Troll 2 and Manos The Hands of Fate in terms of WORST MOVIE EVER. Wow.
And the night ended with MST3K presents Manos the hands of fate. The golden thing about it was Shengs reaction at the end of the movie
Manos: The Hands of Fate is a poor excuse of a movie. I've never seen editing done like that before. #movie126 #movies2011

Manos: The Hands of Fate. Seriously. RT @lori_claire: @ryan_buell what's the worst scary movie you've seen?
Elvira's pick for worst movie of all time? MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE.
The boys have been watching lots of MST3K. The proclamation here is that "Manos: The Hands of Fate" is the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE.
Manos the hands of fate: I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen, even beating Plan 9, which is enjoyably bad.
a) Just found a station that carries Elvira's Movie Macabre! b) I see she's showing Manos The Hands Of Fate tonight! c) WOO-HOO!

"Manos: The Hands of Fate" is not worse (more incompetent) than "Plan 9". "Manos" does actually work as a horror movie.
Tonight: seeing a puppet-version of 'Manos: The Hands of Fate'. In describing the movie to Andrew, used word 'hellbitches' at least 8 times.
So, yeah. "Manos the Hands of Felt" is indeed a puppet version of the wonderfully terrible movie, "Manos the Hands of Fate."

Out of every movie I have ever seen "Manos the Hands of Fate" MST3K style is my favorite; with "Spider Island" coming in a close second.
Journey to Promethea is by far the worst movie ever made. I have new respect for Manos: The Hands of Fate.
@TomServosBlendr I agree.. Makes me long for a good movie like "Manos: The Hands of Fate"
HOLY CRAP. Just discovered that the worst movie ever made, "'Manos,' the Hands of Fate," was shot in El Paso. Is there a museum I can visit?

"The Room" is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. It has more plot holes than "Manos: The Hands of Fate," which is a huge accomplishment
@floptastic Monsters Crash the Pajama Party is one of those little gems, much like Manos: The Hands of Fate. It is a feel good movie.
A descent into movie hell with @mollynussbaum, the 1960's immortal classic "Manos: the Hands of Fate" and jello. BBL!
I must question the popular notion that PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is the worst movie of all time. Because I've seen MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE.
@l0sername B Movie night! things like "Manos" the hands of fate
I have now watched Manos: The Hands of Fate, aka the film unanimously voted by everyone as the worst movie ever. I agree with everyone.
Manos: The Hands of Fate. "Why does every frame in this movie look like someone's last known photograph...?"
Manos: The Hands of Fate. Worst movie ever. Currently in the DVD player. Epic lols ahead.

Manos, the Hands of Fate: the one movie where I can honestly say, just gimme a camcorder, I could do a better job! #fb
@stefanbrogren It's bad but I wouldn't say worst movie ever. That dubious honor, I believe, belongs to Manos: The Hands of Fate.
I'm currently watching MANOS : The Hands of Fate. A movie everyone should be forced to watch at least once.
Outdoor movie night at the Hoover house next Friday. Trying to procure "MST3K Manos: The Hands of Fate", "Army of Darkness", etc. BYOchair
Just reminded myself that Manos: The Hands of Fate is truly the worst movie ever made.
I am watching the movie "The Room" ... it's bad. It may actually be the worst movie I have ever seen. Including Manos The Hands of Fate.
Death T-2 is watching MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Amazingly bad movie, amazingly good episode of MST3K.
Just watched Manos: the hands of fate. Aka, IMDB's proclaimed worst movie of all time.
I have a sudden desire to watch Manos: The Hands of Fate. Is it possible that I forgot how bad that movie is?
Manos: The Hands of Fate is, without any doubt, the worst movie ever made. Don't watch it. You'll have no faith in mankind afterwards.

"Manos" The Hands of Fate is the worst movie I have ever seen. Harold and Kumar is not though, it's quite the opposite.

"Manos": The Hands of Fate really is an awful movie. Why do I let myself do these things?
Also why is Fuse showing From Justin To Kelly that movie has to be the worst movie ever next to Manos The Hands Of Fate.
"Death Race"...not the worst movie I've ever seen. "Manos The Hands of Fate" still holds that title.
( @papyromancer) Note to self: Ask @mhglover if he thinks _Manos, The Hands of Fate_ would make for a good interpretation as a kung fu movie.
Sarah, having now seen both "Manos: The Hands of Fate" & "Original Sins" declares the worst movie ever made...(drum roll)..."Original Sins".
Watching this movie, gives me hope that I could make something better. However, it'd never be as popular as Manos The Hands of Fate...
Watching Manos: The, Hands of Fate. The worst movie ever made... Crying with laughter. :D
@BillCorbett Schindler's List? A Cinematic Titanic movie? Manos: The Hands of Fate?
stayed up late watching MST3K (the movie was "Manos: The Hands of Fate"). office kickball tournament on friday!
However, "Death Tunnel" is, and likely always will be, the worst movie I have ever seen. Even worse than Manos: The Hands of Fate.
@BadAstronomer Would that be Manos... The Hands of Fate? Best movie EVER.
@Toddly00 that movie is freakin awesome! It's right up there with Manos: The Hands of Fate
This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. Somewhere between "The Godfather" and "Manos The Hands of Fate".

@sailert Oh man Manos the hands of fate is the worst MST3K ever!! The best one is simply called "the movie"

There is no more unbearably boring movie than The Duchess. Future generations will MST3K it as ours MST3K'd Manos: The Hands of Fate.
@BostonTweet are you sure "Manos The Hands Of Fate"isn't the greatest movie ever made?
Oh Archive.org. Youre really the best site ever! Dl'ing what "How I Met Your Mother" writers call the worst movie: MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE.
First movie shown will be Manos, The Hands of Fate, and we will take a shot each time they say the name of the movie. Wait no, we'd die.
@pablod So... are we talking _Manos: the Hands of Fate_ badness here? Sounds kind of ballpark for your movie.
"Joel: You know, every frame of this movie looks like someone's last known photograph." - Manos: The Hands of Fate.

Just watched the bootleg trailer for the Dragonball movie. I rate it 1½ Manos: The Hands of Fate.
@BillyCovington NO way this so-called "Zardoz" could beat my all-time favorite movie to hate, "Manos: The Hands of Fate". It was MST3k'd. =D

@ag_michael I still think "Manos: The Hands of Fate" is the worst movie.
"Manos: The Hands of Fate": How NOT to make a movie...
