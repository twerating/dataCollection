@TheRyanMacLean Possibly because it was the last movie i watched but The Lobster is going to be hard to beat for me
the lobster sounds like the perfect r9k movie
"The Lobster" is quite the movie. A spectacular grotesque comedie, a powerful social satire
The Lobster: An excellent movie, but one that I don't feel safe recommending to those who want, have, or don't want to be in a relationship.
Watching The Lobster at @wshed this evening. Not been here for a movie in a while.

I think 'wtf did i just see' would be the only human reaction possible after seeing The lobster. The movie, not the animal.
Not that it'd have been a contest but The Lobster is easily the best 2015 movie featuring both Ben Whishaw and Lea Seydoux.
The Lobster is a perfect first date movie.

The Lobster is a great movie-it's odd tho!!!
The Lobsterていう映画が1016年に公開決定したのに対してベンウィショーの役がわからず探してみたけど犬って書いてあったしでも四つ足歩行の彼の演技は良かったとか不思議なことが書いてある。ちなみにこないだUKでプレミアあってましたね。めちゃくちゃファンサよくてかわいかった
The Lobster - perfect first date movie … (The Lobster is not a perfect first date movie)
Went to see the new Colin Farrell movie The Lobster last night, pretentious art house nonsense. Farrell badly needs a new agent. Avoid.
So saw the The Lobster movie last night - intriguing, mesmerising, curious, thought provoking, art haus. Still deciding if I liked it!
@ThatKevinSmith so....what are your thoughts on the lobster movie? I think I've seen something with same idea before #walrustheft
The Lobster: Almost a perfect movie! Seriously funny and painfully dark. Farrell absolutely nails this role! - http://plotapp.io/p/3rip72 
Been to see The Lobster tonight. Remarkable and bizarre movie. A black satirical romantic sci-fi fantasy horror comedy.

Went to see the Lobster. I approve of most art that follows a bizarre internal logic relentlessly. Prolly not a good date movie though.
It's taken until mid-October but I've finally seen a 5/5 movie, The Lobster. Don't think I'll ever see anything more unique this year.
Movie on The List: The Lobster.
The Lobster, the best merchandising/advertising/graphic design concept in movie history. Just brilliant! @LobsterFilm #ColinFarrell

The Lobster is the most unusual movie out now. My goodness, it is worth your time and money. Its intelligence is challenged by none.

Taking the good one out to a movie, we're watching a screening of The Lobster
The Lobster was a terrible movie.
The Lobster was without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema. And I've seen a lot of movies at the cinema. Just, awful.
The Lobster, then. Very smart,incredibly cold,half an hour heavy and a horror movie rather than a comedy.

The Lobster is an unusual movie about relationships and touching in a weird way. You will never look at animals the same way again #nyff
"The Lobster" is sickly funny and profoundly unsettling. You may need to watch a Nancy Meyers movie afterward to recover. #NYFF
THE LOBSTER: Best movie about relationships since, I don't know, (Elaine May's) THE HEARTBREAK KID? Ha. #NYFF

The Lobster: Toronto Film Festival review http://buff.ly/1K3udTi  @EW #Movie #Headlines
I'm trying to watch a movie and the lobster tries to get to touchy feely with me
Rachel Weisz Takes 'The Lobster' to the Toronto Film Festival http://www.justjared.com/2015/09/12/rachel-weisz-takes-the-lobster-to-the-toronto-film-festival/ … via @JustJared - I NEED to see this movie!
more praise for The Lobster: yay! a movie that doesn't have an ending spelled out! ambiguity for once is refreshing :) @LobsterFilm
Huge fuck up at the LOBSTER screening right now. Movie stopped then rewound an entire reels, about 20 minutes. #TIFF15
15. The Lobster - quirky fun movie but really felt long. I loved the performances and the premise is very interesting.Glad I saw it #TIFF15

@donwill I'm going to see this movie called the lobster where you get 45 days to find a mate at a hotel or get turned into an animal
Sicario and The Lobster: kind of the same movie in a way sort of?
THE LOBSTER is one big #WTF of a movie. I get the satirizing of societal tyranny, but it may be too bizarre for its own good. #TIFF15

. @jimmerfredette I can pinpoint the exact moment I hit puberty and it was the scene in the movie Splash when she's eating the lobster. RT?
Favorite movie quote: "We have a blind date with destiny, and it looks like she's ordered the lobster."
@katiezoid Sounds like my sort of horror movie. "God Only Knows What's in the Lobster Bisque: An Erotic Thriller."
I watch the lobster lunch scene in My Best Friend's Wedding a minimum of five times for every one full completion of the movie.
We've just discovered there is a movie out next year called 'The Lobster' - the plot is a little surprising though http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3464902/ …
Me and my paisano Luis boutta catch a movie and hit up the lobster
'I say a little prayer' what a classic movie moment!! #mybestfriendswedding Love the lobster hand gloves waving in the background!!

She's Dating The Lobster is way better than She's Dating The Gangster (movie of course)
I guess She's Dating The Lobster is a better movie title.

my fam was playing a "guess what xmas movie this quote is from" n there was the lobster quote and no one knew and I screamed "LOVE ACTUALLY"
bring on the lobster shrimp n pasta,feel like im in a robert denerio movie sitting in this resturant
Line of the day. Guess the movie: "Listen up. Listen! We've got a blind date with destiny. And it looks like she's ordered the lobster."
@slackerpower About the same time for me, my first Godzilla movie was him versus the Lobster monster and the larva Mothra was there too.
@ZaidJilani I am old and love that movie, altho not necessarily the lobster part; it's touching, but maybe because of age and losses.
Nice! RT @RobinSmrtPtient Reminds me of a line from a movie: "We have a blind date with destiny, and she's ordered the lobster!" #hcpt
This how i know i havent seen this movie in a whileeeeee. The lobster got a Jamaican accent .
"We've been given our parts in the #nativity play! And I'm the #lobster!" Is there a better #Christmas #movie than #LoveActually? Nope
@mollynadeau you are the lobster and will forever be my lobster! The best thing about that movie... your epic nickname :)
@DrGMLaTulippe I love that movie. Fallon and Barrymore had great, realistic chemistry. I love his "la la la" moment at the lobster dinner.
The song the lobster sings in the little mermaid movie
@MarkMMerrett that movie had no budget! I wondered why the town just didn't get a pot of boiling water & drive the lobster into it.
Only movie I want to see in the future is a politically-charged Marvel-produced BLACK PANTHER movie. Also Yorgos Lanthimos' THE LOBSTER.
Can you tell which Christmas movie I'm watching from this quote? "We have been given our parts in the Nativity play. And I'm the lobster."
Watching this movie and the lobster looks so good!!

@Pink Great movie. My favorite scene is the lobster scene. The first and the second lobster scene have great meaning.
