First my co-worker gifts me Rocket League, and now my boss comes in and gives me two free movie tickets. Is this The Twilight Zone? Hello?
Sure you could complain there's another Twilight movie out right now. OR you could celebrate that there'll never be another.

In a perfect world, Buffy the Vampire Slayer would suddenly appear in the middle of the movie Twilight, stake Edward, and smack Bella.

That was a big clue I wouldn't be able to take her seriously in the movie. That was some bad Twilight hair.

I bought the twilight soundtrack after the movie came out and it was the best investment I ever made

Hunger games is the only movie i would sit for over two hours for and watch & twilight thats it
50 shades of grey is such a bad movie. Probably not worse than the first twilight tho
I just want another movie on the twilight series
Twilight is still such a good movie lol

Did they choose a Palm Beach Community College film student to direct the first Twilight movie????
It would be unfortunate to dismiss Hunger Games as another teen movie. Surprisingly good in most aspects. Makes Twilight look like a peanut.

I mean i knew it was similar from reading but everything in the movie is exactly like twilight.
Pixar literally created a better love story in 8 minutes in the movie UP than Twilight did in 4 movies.
Among all 5 Twilight movies, the first movie has the best sound soundtrack.

Nollywood Movie Review: Twilight Sisters http://nollywoodforever.com/twilight-sisters/ … #AdaAmeh
The Twilight movie came out 7 years ago... Feel old yet?
Questioning why I ever thought Twilight was a good movie
Never realized how terrible the movie twilight was until this very moment...
Twilight was such a trash movie but I loved it so much
I'm watching twilight and just realizing how stupid this movie actually is
Twilight is such an awkward movie
Watching twilight makes me realize how much better the book was than the movie
Is it bad that I can quote the entire Twilight movie?
Twilight is a terrible movie. TERRIBLE.
Someone have a Twilight movie marathon with me asap pls
I forget how awkward the first Twilight movie was..
twilight is such a terrible movie
if you are ever sad watch twilighT THATS MY MOVIE
the first twilight movie is so monotone

When I watch twilight now I just laugh at every scene bc it's so dumb. Why did I ever even remotely like this movie???
twilight has got to be the worst movie with the worst actors and the worst plot.
My favorite movie twilight is on
I love the filter on the entire first Twilight movie
why does it look like they put a filter on the movie twilight?
Twilight is such a dumb movie, if some guy was all up on me like Edward was I would actually drink bleach.
A New Twilight movie would be everything
Twilight will forever always be my favorite movie
This movie makes me feel so awkward but I love the books so I always overlooked it #Twilight
why is the twilight soundtrack the best movie soundtrack of all time
I love the twilight saga but damn the first movie is crap
WHY IS THERE ONLY ONE TWILIGHT MOVIE ON NETFLIX
I'm pretty sure there's a filter on the whole movie of Twilight..
I love the twilight series but the movie is just so fucking cheesy I'm
Why is Twilight such an awkward movie....
No joke twilight is the worst movie ever but the actors are beautiful so I will finish it
i used to think the twilight movie was romantic ️
Love this movie! #Twilight
I was crazy about twilight when it was popular but when the last movie came out I didn't mind tbh
should I have a twilight movie marathon
Thank you @ABCFamily for showing the #twilight extended edition! love this movie, specially the soundtrack
You know it's bad when you can't tell the difference between the real twilight movie and the parody
Maria's watching Twilight, she's really into this movie
twilight is a good movie idc what anyone says
I'll never get over the excitement that'd build up in me when a new twilight movie would release
Twilight is my favorite movie to watch when I'm in a mood to completely tear apart the hard work and creativity of someone else.
I watch Twilight like I've never seen it before every time it comes on. This movie still has my heart.
twilight is actually the worst movie ever created lmfao
In Twilight, the eye staring and body movement is half of the movie
Never forget that Anna Kendrick was that bitch Jessica in the first twilight movie before she was a cool quirky girl in an A Capella group
Flash Sentry's element of harmony is definitely Defense, as he protected Twilight Sparkle with the cut out pictures in the first movie.
The movie twilight is so different from the other 3 movies it's not even funny
I'm watching Twilight, and I didn't realize how awful this movie was
The first twilight movie is like a low budget lifetime movie... w/ bad lighting
I love the first twilight movie so much I could watch it a million times
I remember how my fam would get so annoyed bc I used to knw all the lines of the movie Twilight. ALL.& I would say all of it while watching
Watching Twilight & omg the fuckin teen angst this damn movie brings back
Twilight will always be my favorite movie
only twilight movie I'll watch more than once is the last one....mostly for the fight scene.
Omfg twilight is such a terrible movie
less than 30 minutes into fifty shades of grey movie and this guy is terrifying wtf this is more mentallyviolently psychotic than twilight
PSA: the first Twilight movie came out in 2008. Thank you, carry on
@PinkRabbitPro LOL...no, my goto burned out movie is not #Twilight. clue #2: its made before 1988
I always get the most random urges to watch twilight and then I just laugh the whole movie
Mom: "Let's watch a Christmas movie!" *puts in Twilight*
@EsterTekla @ritzy_jewels @peddoc63 @JohnJwso like a bad dream in twilight zone movie!
Eclipse was my fave book in the Twilight series, but my least fave movie. It was awful tbh
Tonight's movie lineup: Hocus Pocus, Hunger Games, Twilight, and Sleepy Hollow. Not bad, #ABCFamily. Not bad at all.
