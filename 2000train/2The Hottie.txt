I'm watching this fighting movie and it's in Spanish but I'm not paying attention because I'm just focused on the hottie kicking ass
Watching a movie about a man cheating on 3 girls, his wife, the mistress, and the hottie mistress. This is so damn stupid.
I just found out Al from Step By Step plays the "nottie" in that movie The Hottie & the Nottie with Paris Hilton. Pretty cool, right?
There are a reasons why "Showgirls", "The Hottie and the Nottie" and "Bratz: The Movie" pass the test.

This guy in my psych class looks like the hottie from the movie sleepover
A clumsy movie that tried to send out a positive message but kept putting both size 10s in it. Wouldn't have been better without The Hottie.
@zombiewes retweets are from The Creeping Terror, which was last weeks movie. Tonight @colhewobbles watches The Hottie and The Nottie.

Next week's movie and #40 on our list, The Hottie and The Nottie (2008) starring Paris Hilton. Please shoot me now....... #100badmovies
The "hottie" character in every movie wasn't attractive to me. She was a MALE fantasy, not just a "people attracted to women" fantasy.
Psycho pass movie was really amazing I loved the action it's extremely awesome! Wanted to see more of the hottie enforcer & less Kougami
Movie date last night with the hottie! @justineeydevvv https://instagram.com/p/5mTE-Bw7oy/
