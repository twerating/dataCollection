Daddy's Home is gonna be an absolutely hilarious movie. I got a damn good feeling about it.
There is so much wrong with Home Alone. It's not a comedy. It's a movie about neglect and bad parenting. But I still like it.
My favorite holiday movie is the one where Macaulay Culkin's family leaves him behind for 8 days. You know, "Home Shalom."
I gotta see that movie "Daddy's Home" with Will Ferrell in it
I want to by the Home movie sound track
home alone is the greatest Christmas movie series of all time
The Daddy's Home movie trailer looks like one of those fake movie trailers they used at the beginning of Tropic Thunder.
I am watching this crap movie on W that actually has the Canadian Tire guy and a Home Depot guy in it... Good ol' Canadian content TV haha
Home Alone RT @TheAcademy Question of the Day: What #movie gets you into the holiday spirit?

Home Alone really would be a better movie if Catherine O’Hara left her husband for John Candy at the end.
Mom: when we get home I got a movie for us to watch Me: what? Mom: sideshows & hoes
