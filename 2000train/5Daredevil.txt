@SoleroLady Gotham is good. Daredevil. Fargo is brilliant but watch the movie first (also on Netflix).
Are we going to see a new #Daredevil movie, with our Matt Murdock Charlie Cox as well? #AskMarvel
I find the weirdest things hilarious like Matt hissing during the Daredevil movie.

@theladymea 5. I love to marathon tv shows & movie sets. Just finished Daredevil & Jessica Jones this week.
Daredevil = best thing out of the comic book movie/TV world this year.
@30_Helens “batman uses PRISM to get daredevil powers, from the movie Daredevil.”
i want to rewatch the xmen movies, elektra and daredevil (movie); to catch up on ouat, ahs n htgawm and start daredevil (show) n supergirl

@beca1780 @SuperHeroSpeak Haha the Netflix show: @Daredevil. Don't waste your time with the movie. Utter garbage. Show is great though!
@AmyTheFrone @Darius_Spencer I was thinking either Daredevil or the non-Ed-Norton Hulk movie but either way.
#PointBreak daredevil stunts was breathtaking. But movie in totality? Not too good, not too shabby.
The only thing I care about in life right now is the Deadpool movie and season 2 of Daredevil

@ghostnessie or just watch the 13 hour Daredevil movie on Netflix
melanie asked if daredevil was about russia, and i've just said "didn't you see the movie with ben affleck?"
. @caitmiller Daredevil is a great choice especially if you are referring to the newest TV show and not the Aflleck movie :D
@AdrianaGameOver Current Daredevil is more of a crimeshow than the movie. More like the Wire in some respects
I'm running out of interesting shows to watch. Considering Daredevil, but the 2003 movie traumatised me.
After Jessica Jones and Daredevil, I'm not gonna be able to watch another Avengers movie the same way.
Not seeing #Daredevil in a MCU movie pic.twitter.com/ym60iOawbP
this Daredevil movie is a 6/10 tbh
@syn_esn @MissMintMav However, Jessica Jones is unlike all of Marvel's movie products. Dark, grim, violent. Similar to Netflix's Daredevil
I secretly liked the Daredevil movie but Ben Affleck as Batman is still ugh for me
Daredevil is insane, almost makes up for that god awful movie
The soundtrack from the 2003 Daredevil movie is my favourite historical artifact
I'm going to criticize Ben Affleck as Batman in that movie just because he didn't do Daredevil any justice.
@ZARYAN0VA I mean, him flipping out over netflix daredevil is literally identical to how alan moore reacted to the watchmen movie

I've only seen the Daredevil movie once because I don't like it but I remember it so well what the fuck.
Just watch the first episode of #Daredevil and its way better then the movie....
Man if Daredevil and The Punisher were included in the Civil War movie..
I'll be really mad if Daredevil doesn't show up in a Marvel movie.
@StarleeKine More than Daredevil, less than any other superhero show/movie. Super powers are justified through science-as-magic.
They should reboot the Daredevil movie using Christian Bale, not the other way around.
@emilyadoll I forgot about the shitty daredevil movie but I'm not counting that as existing because it was so bad

im watching the daredevil movie and no offense but the first three netflix daredevil episodes I watched are way better
Daredevil (2003) is the most early-00s movie ever.
I'm high af and I'm just realizing how bad the Daredevil movie actually is. Holy shit.
I hope Daredevil gets into an Avengers movie too. I love shit linking across multiple tv series and movies. It's genius.
Totally not watching the Ben Affleck Daredevil movie right now. Nope. *nods lots because I'm lying and am currently watching*
A reboot of the movie Daredevil with Charlie Cox would be nice. @Marvel @Daredevil
@Jacopo_della_Q @BillyZane @ZackSnyder cause he daredevil and that movie blowed, that last trailer spoiled BvS anyways

Marvel’s Daredevil TV series on Netflix is better than any superhero movie ever made. And now Jessica Jones is even better.
@somekindalova @blogdiva somebody must have forgotten his greatest crime. The daredevil movie.
I haven't seen any movie that's part of the MCU, but there's absolutely no way any of them are better than Jessica Jones or Daredevil
They should reboot the Daredevil movie using Christian Bale, not the other way around.

Oh yeah Marvel fans. Don't forget how that "Daredevil" movie was

@Pokey_19 @ladyhana Well, to be honest, the script of Daredevil was bad. A good actor can't make a bad movie good
y'all didn't like Ben in Daredevil? I thought that movie was pretty good.

@ty_carlton @Rowdogeaster daredevil is the worst super hero movie of all time and he owns up to that he's about to kill this role
That Daredevil movie left a bad taste in everyone's mouth but, the writing,tone,casting and directing was horrible. Wasn't Ben's fault
But from Argo to Gone Girl,ever since that Daredevil trash,he hasn't put out a bad movie. I'm excited for him
@brendan_zang because that daredevil movie is 12 years old. Plus it was awful and didn't make it anywhere

Starting Daredevil now, one question.. in both this the old Affleck movie, and this new Netflix series, why is it always raining??
Y'all don't know what it's like to watch Daredevil (The affleck movie) and be forced to like it because there is nothing else

@kbruce313 @SuperheroFeed I've only seen the 1st episode, but wasn't impressed. Daredevil shut me up in 3 minutes & made me forget the movie
@_amyygee as far as shows I recommend daredevil and Jessica Jones and I have a lot of movie recommendations
People who think DAREDEVIL is better than JESSICA JONES also think THE DARK KNIGHT is the best movie ever made and eat dirt. Presumably.
Daredevil is a KungFu movie, Jessica Jones is Humphrey Bogart noir.

On the old Movie Channel, Daredevil would be flagged with VIOLENCE and Jessica Jones would be ADULT SITUATIONS. Luke Cage = NUDITY?
DC Movie (MoS) > Marvel Movies DC TV > Marvel TV The only thing beating DC right now is Daredevil & Jessica Jones.
Lol. Punisher did such a good job in Daredevil season 2 that Netflix decided to give him his own show and turn Iron Fist into a movie? Ha
JEEZ Why the hell @vincentdonofrio isn't in every movie and tv series?!? He is so great, AMAZING ACTOR!!! #Daredevil
Finally watching Daredevil (new series). It's pretty good. I honestly liked the movie, so wasn't sure what to expect. But I like the pilot!
Marvel via DareDevil and Jessica Jones on Netflix do a better job of fleshing out villains than in any Marvel MOVIE (sans Loki)
@the_moviebob Daredevil was a nice proof of concept, but Jessica is clearly the better show. Still, JJ feels less fit for movie than DD.
At this point who from Marvel TV gets the bigger pop if they do a movie cameo, Daredevil or Jessica Jones? I feel like Jessica.
That's like debating what's better between Taken 3 the new Fantastic Four movie n Ben Affleck's Daredevil

@9er7torm Precisely. Superhero movies may be a little formulaic but if they are poor (Daredevil, Green Lantern) then movie goers say so.
So many things to watch! #JessicaJones again, #Daredevil again, a holiday movie... Hmmm
Daredevil, except he's the character Whistler from Sneakers, the greatest movie ever made
When they eventually have Daredevil, Jessica, Cage & Iron Fist team up in a crossover Netflix movie >>>>
@_Kellz_xxx he doesn't have great superhero movie form - the Daredevil movie was awful but I trust him. Actors have surprised us in the
@Basic_Chunnel I am thankful for the Daredevil movie soundtrack.
Daredevil on nexflix is pretty good makes up for that terrible Ben affleck movie

@ZombieObed I love the spidey daredevil team ups. Those are the best. Id love to see Daredevil pop up in a Marvel movie with spidey
I think I know why I'm a bit lukewarm on Daredevil and Jessica Jones: they both feel like movie narratives stretched out to several hours.

If Daredevil and Jessica Jones aren't in the next Avengers movie I'm gonna be so mad.

Affleck wasn't bad in daredevil, the movie itself was just bad (script, story, etc)

I'm talking about Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin in the Daredevil TV show, not Michael C Duncan's from the movie. He was epic as Kingpin.
The only superhero movie I can manage to watch is Daredevil. The rest. are. trashhhhhhhh

@suburbansane The DareDevil movie was my favorite. I think after that movie that's when I started getting into superheroes
cuz you know this kind of stuff wouldn't be in a Captain America movie lmao #JessicaJones #Daredevil
@PhillipeMeUp some Goliath guy Also no Daredevil here Just Spiderman in the movie
@s13msadiq Just watch Daredevil in one big run and its the best movie.
I wish daredevil was in this movie now that would be awesome #CivilWar
I can't believe I (and you too I guess) get a new #starwars movie, #batmanvsuperman a 2nd season of #Daredevil AND #CaptainAmericaCivilWar
. @JessicaJones is officially better than Daredevil and is the greatest movie/TV/media related thing Marvel has ever made #Aka1000cuts
im kind of glad daredevil n jess jones are not involved in all the flashy movie stuff tbh for once in my Life i prefer the gritty shit
Dawg, we get Season 2 of Daredevil, with the Punisher, before this movie even drops. Marvel casually shitting on everyone.
You could make a terrific DAREDEVIL movie out of the DAREDEVIL series.
So Jessica jones isn't as good as daredevil but man it's fucking insane. It's pretty fucking brutal for a comic book show / movie
I hope one day Marvel makes a movie as dark and gritty as Daredevil and Jessica Jones, would be incredible

@devincf I have a theory that your hatred for Foggy Nelson on DareDevil is why you didn't like the final Hunger Games movie
@JonSchnepp @Daredevil What would you think of @vincentdonofrio showing up as #Kingpin in a spiderman movie?
@JonSchnepp @Daredevil what was more enjoyable a show about a marvel character or a movie ?
@iamlaurenp Absolutely. Comic book movie world has gotten too bloated & fx driven. #JessicaJones & #Daredevil show what the reality would be
The daredevil movie was a wild experience I can't believe that I watched that movie on loop when I was a chile
I want to make a Punisher monster movie. They cast the Punisher Perfectly for Daredevil Ssn2. But they're probably gonna bork the execution
@spacetimeayy pretty much every marvel movie is if you compare it to daredevil and jessica jones. these are so much darker and more violent
Jessica Jones was good. Real good. Plays out more like a movie than Daredevil did. Helps that Netflix autoplay now skips opening credits.
Jessica Jones completed. Amazing series. This and Daredevil really are a tier above any other Marvel show/movie. #JessicaJones
One thing i'll say about the Daredevil (2003) movie: Wake Me Up is in the soundtrack. Thats all you need to know. Its 2003.
@badwolffe YES both Daredevil and Jessica Jones got some of my favorite villains in any superhero show or movie
Most interesting part of Spidey is that he can be big time (carry a movie with Avengers) or street level (work w/ ppl like Daredevil)
Daredevil the show > Daredevil the movie

@GnomeGnuts ... less walking around. I havent seen Daredevil the series, as I prefer the movie, which I love.
Really loved the #Daredevil series on #Netflix . Going to check out the movie & see how it really is @johncampea @JonSchnepp @5150ellis
also i didn't realize foggy from daredevil was in the movie until the end credits lol i was like I KNEW HE LOOKED FAMILIAR
@hoodedu i think this is a problem daredevil had. they use the binge-watch format as an excuse to treat it like one long movie...
@SawxUtero daredevil the show not the movie.
This church looks like the church from the daredevil movie
"The Daredevil movie was better than the Netflix TV series" - said no one ever.
The problem with #JessicaJones is the same problem #Daredevil had. It doesn't know how to end. Is it a 13 hour movie or TV show?

Me in the guy from 12 stones in that evanescence song from the Ben affleck daredevil movie voice regarding social justice: wake me up
If u don't like the Ben affleck daredevil movie then like we can't b friends
Bugbear: #JessicaJones + #Daredevil both set in the MCU, both reference movie events... Yet in the NY skyline Avengers Tower is nowhere.
Nah but really. Jessica Jones is nothing like Daredevil. Jessica more of a mystery noire. Daredevil was a fight movie.
So Norman Osborn, Theon Greyjoy, and Wesley from Daredevil are all in this movie along with Neo. Cool.
@hellopopbot NICE!! The look of those pops are still better than the Affleck Daredevil movie hahaha

I'm gonna check out this Daredevil series, if it's anything like the movie i'm gonna enjoy it a LOT.
Finished watching Jane Eyre and Netflix recs Daredevil as movie finishes, what kind of logic?
"I'm Ben Affleck. I mean 'I'm Batman'. I mean 'I'm the idiot that ruined Daredevil and every other movie I've ever been in.' Much better."
You apparently can't have a flashback in a movie or tv show without the Rolling Stones playing in the background. #Daredevil

The movie daredevil was & still is od wavy
Thanks to a certain early 2000’s movie, I had zero interest in Daredevil. The Netflix series, though, is so engrossing and well-done!
When was the Lundgren PUNISHER movie? 89? Could have gotten the Van Damme DAREDEVIL movie after that and had them crossover.
If Marvel Studios excited like 20 years earlier we'd absolutely have gotten a DAREDEVIL movie starring Van Damme right?
@Brian_OConor518 poor Daredevil this netflix sites is like watching a die hard movie. So beat up at the end of an episode.
idk why there was a daredevil trailer after this movie review but that's okay bc daredevil

Did you know "Right Before Your Eyes" by Hoobastank was on the "Daredevil" movie soundtrack? #HoobastankFacts
@cultjer Great movie. Man portraying the Grandpa is also Father Lantom on Daredevil Netflix. Good actor
You could remove every movie reference from Daredevil and it wouldn't change a single thing in that show.
I bet when they created the Daredevil movie they thought they were creating something really special.
I keep forgetting daredevil is a TV show too. Keep wanting to slap people who say daredevil is good (movie).
Watched this today. 2 of Evanescence's finest songs in one movie?.. That's too much goodness! ★ Daredevil — https://path.com/p/1ZaAm8

daredevil should be in the civil war movie cause he is hella in the civil war comics
Think, for a second, how shitty Daredevil (2003) would've been without "Bring Me to Life." That song made the movie.

Putting off all of my Tuesday night TV to watch the original Daredevil movie. This movie was everything to me as a kid, this started it all.
@SuperheroFeed But what if you are white and you really want to go as the Kingpin from the movie Daredevil and you hate the one from tv?
My friend: i'm watching the Daredevil movie again. me: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO YOURSELF.
The Daredevil movie has surprisingly good bones. I feel like most of why it sucked was studio interference. And Colin Farrel
The soundtrack for the Daredevil movie was perfect it really suited the character unlike everything else.
Is there a line in a superhero movie truly dumber - not sillier, dumber - than Daredevil's "How do you kill a man without fear?" I'd say no.
Thinking about walking out of my class because they all said George Clooney was the best batman and that the daredevil movie was good
The new Joker reminds me of Bullseye from the original 'Daredevil' movie. IE a massive mistake.

Daredevil is on. The old daredevil movie during my childhood
Never watched the Daredevil movie, but after glimpsing at 15 seconds of on TV, I get it. I get the hatred.
I still think daredevil was a good movie
I actually thought the Daredevil movie was pretty good. obviously not nearly as good as the show but I liked it.
Daredevil a dookie ass movie lol
wait if they kill elektra in 2003's daredevil, how did her movie happen? was it a prequel? i have so many questions

Why am I watching the Daredevil movie right now?
Back in the day, I thought Daredevil (Ben Affleck) was a decent movie. Now I think it's absolute trash.
Man the Daredevil movie is an atrocity. It makes Spiderman 3 look like high concept art.
I didn't think I would sit through this whole daredevil movie but I'm really focused in right now
i've never seen the old daredevil movie but it just came on and i didn't change the channel and it's so bad i'm screaming
Daredevil the movie is nothing like the show. I like the show way more.
the daredevil movie is on & i'm laughin god bless charlie cox & netflix & charlie cox
Daredevil was great because as a show, it was movie quality on all levels in the best way. The fights, acting, drama, suspense. #TBGPodcast
The stupid daredevil movie is on tv tonight so of course i'm going to skype with my twin brother so it kinda seems like he's watching w/ me

Some batman movie cliches sprinkled in this one. Although, I don't remember the bats setting his symbol ablaze until TDKR.... #Daredevil
The 2003 #Daredevil movie isn't bad... if only they ended it after the first 15 minutes. I'm so glad #Netflix made up for it.
Good afternoon @BenAffleck, hope all is well. Just wanted to remind you of that Daredevil movie you starred in. Cheers!
ITS GIVING THAT SHITTY DAREDEVIL MOVIE WITH BEN AFFLEK AND IT HAS WAKE ME UP INSIDE PLAYING FOR AN ENTIRE SCENE IM DYING
For some reason my family is watching the Daredevil movie and oh my god its so terrible.
The director of the Daredevil movie was obviously a huge Evanescence fan
Grabe talaga 'yung Thai movie na The Raid, tagalized version pa. Daredevil stunt sa hallway. US version, where na you?

The Daredevil movie is on TNT. That's a better option than streaming the shitty Jacksonville-Buffalo game.
Why is daredevil such a bad movie
Was worried Daredevil might have "case of the week" but it really has zero filler in it which is godlike. Makes it feel like one long movie.
@_icze4r That site looks like it should be in the movie "Daredevil" as a fake ad
I liked Daredevil, but the costume was horrible. Even that awful Ben Affleck movie got the Ds right. #netflixvirgin pic.twitter.com/AwK07tQItC
We got a long shot in what, episode 2 of Daredevil? I don't think I've seen one in a modern superhero movie. It's basic filmmaking.
If we count Daredevil as a movie, then it's one of the MCU's best.
Daredevil and Bucky in one movie is all I need in life
Yuuup. Daredevil movie a writers frown. Think Affleck can play Batman w/caliber he hinted at in Hollywoodland & recent. #BlackComicsChat
I really think Marvel's Netflix shows will be better than the movie universe. Daredevil was amazing, Jessica Jones looks dope.
I'm a supporter of not translating the original movie/show english titles. "Demolisher" sounds weird instead of "Daredevil"
That Jessica Jones trailer is just fueling the fandom to try to merge TV & the movies. What I mean is seeing Daredevil or Jones in a movie.
@ztiworoh @pkollar wait you saying daredevil the movie was bad or daredevil the series was bad, because movie = the worst, series = amazing
#LT And you thought @Daredevil was as dark as Marvel was going to get. Ha! Kinda makes you wish they'd make a rated R movie just to see.
Ben Affleck Daredevil movie has a funeral scene with Evanescence playing so it is basically the best super hero movie ever made
girls don't want boys girls want daredevil in a mcu movie
Am I the only one who thinks the Daredevil movie costume is alright?
Also, say what you will about that Daredevil movie, but it has the greatest funeral scene ever...to feature an Evanescence song during it.
Thinking a lot about Daredevil. The movie, not the show.
@Tlieso @Daredevil Great thing about netflix is the barage of shows... I love the 13 episode movie absolute game changer for tv.
@SuperBroMovies daredevil was a mediocre movie, but not "So bad".
Did you like season one of Daredevil? Did you like the movie 300? Do you like Ben's suit in BvS?

Even though I don't like the Daredevil movie I wanted to cry when Bullseye was setting church bells off and Matt was in pain the poor soul.
I'm more hyped about the TV shows than the movie, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Ironfist
@amsavanna alright, if you're into Marvel: Daredevil Non Marvel: Dexter Movie: A Clockwork Orange (weird fucking movie but awesome)

https://soundcloud.com/evan-ross-ney/intro … I rewatched the Daredevil series on Netflix. This just popped into my head. #daredevilseason2 #tv #movie #videogames
@Emi1yRogers Daredevil was better than any Marvel movie. TV format gives more time for character development & movie pacing feels rushed.
I feel bad for the Fantastic Four cast, but if Affleck could come back after that terrible Daredevil movie, they should be ok too.
@johnolilly Narcos, Daredevil, or Merlin. I can't stop watching Merlin, it's like a buddy cop movie with adorable antics, & John Hurt.
I like Daredevil (movie) Sue me.

Daredevil vs Spider-Man movie; it begins with them being pals and teaming up ends with Daredevil becoming evil.
I always lean more towards #DCcomics over #MarvelComics but #Daredevil might be the best superhero ever put on screen. Movie or TV show!

The first thing I watch on my return to #Netflix: Marvel's #Daredevil and it's awesome! Much better than the 2003 movie.
@AgentDorian daredevil cameos in civil war and since Bruce is playing games she moves on dates him and the movie is them taking on a boss
@MichaelROLeary @PushGlassesUp @JessicaJones @Daredevil hey that's the OLDBOY movie poster!
DareDevil is my favorite movie
Definitely had better weeks, but finishing it off early rewatching Daredevil* *The series, not the movie. Do you think I'm masochistic?
Whenever I see my bath I always think of the unexplained bath in the Daredevil movie.
There's really no such thing as a dark Marvel movie except Winter Soldier. Hell, Daredevil is light years beyond the movies in darkness

@Heyvain duh duh duhhhh hahaha yup got alot of crossovers. After you're done with flash, go watch daredevil. Wayy better than the movie
Marvel did a great job with "Daredevil" series making us forget that there was a daredevil movie that came out.
It just hit me the other day that the gym Matt trains at in Daredevil is the same where Steve was in the first Avengers movie
my granddad said th daredevil series isn't good compared to th movie w ben affleck n i want to brawl
@emancan i walked out on the Ben Affleck daredevil movie and never finished it
"Last night was a one-off. It was like the movie Daredevil or Gremlins 2." Sex with the ex. #PHFinale
That Ben Affleck Daredevil movie had some really cool ideas, Michael Clark Duncan as Kingpin rocked and the costume was actually great.

@drmoore The Daredevil series on Netflix is a blast. BBC’s Sherlock is the best show I’ve seen in years. Each episode is a mini-movie.

@Twerkshley Well Trigun is really good. It's on Netflix. Unanime related Daredevil, Mortal combat the movie and courage the cowardly dog.
The daredevil movie is like a time capsule of terrible things Hollywood thought was good in the early millennium.
remembers why Daredevil 2003 was so bad? it wasn't Ben Affleck's fault, it was because the movie was nothing like the comics!
Started watching Daredevil by accident cause i thought it was a movie
@Hammyhok Yeah? I've always been so.. turned off by daredevil after that awful movie lol.

Daredevil the TV show is better than the movie, but that’s not saying much. it’s a good show.
You know the goodside of Kingpin being in Daredevil is, if they choose to do Sinister Six for a Spider-Man movie he'll get transferred there
My only problem is, Spider-Man HAS TO appear in Daredevil at least once. Or Daredevil can appear in the Spider-Man movie. It has to happen
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/xKh9nLGa5pg?a  Action movies 2014 Full Movie English Hollywood Daredevil 2003 Ben Affleck American

|: If Matty came out as Daredevil and it's not like the time Miley Cyrus did in that movie, I'll be super disappointed.
We need Daredevil... I need Daredevil in this movie.. @Marvel please let Daredevil in Civil War. Please tell me he's in it
The Daredevil movie is like watching the Daredevil tv show while intoxicated.
@BitikoferAustin I have to admit, I didn't really dislike Daredevil (the movie w/ Ben), so I think he'll be great as the Bat :) & what...
watching the stardust movie is so hard after daredevil came out
The movie 'Daredevil' earned in total only a bit more than 'The Avengers' did in a single day.

it is a daredevil loaded griller thing surely named after the daredevil movie staring matt damon
The daredevil series is better than the daredevil movie imo
Do I actually like the Daredevil movie or do I just watch it for Jennifer Garner is a question I ask myself all the time.
ok honestly why isnt daredevil in the civil war movie he plays like such a big part in civil war but ok marvel OKAY
The daredevil series has to be sick to make up for that horrible movie in the early 2000s
Finally finished Netflix’s #Daredevil. Overall I liked it but they could’ve cut 85% of the fluff and made an extended origin story movie.

The daredevil netflix original series is 100x better then the movie
@rahulmalik1997 do you mean the Netflix tv show of Daredevil or the movie Daredevil?

Sometimes I watch that Ben Affleck Daredevil movie before going out on patrols. Then let the rage do the rest.

So, Daredevil on Netflix was so much better than the movie. Wow.
Daredevil Series Just Embarrasses The Daredevil Movie....They Should Stop
Two hours of Daredevil on Netflix is better than any movie Marvel has produced.
IF DAREDEVIL IS IN THE MOVIE IM GOING TO FLIP OML
I can't wait for that Daredevil vs Superman movie to come out next year!
I'm watching Daredevil (the movie) on TV and there's an Evanescence song in every other scene.
//also yes the Daredevil movie is on tv
i need to make dad watch daredevil but he's wary because of the movie lmao
Just finished Daredevil, and oh my god, it's amazing. Didn't expect it to be this gritty. Glad Marvel chose a show over a movie for this.
My dad has the daredevil movie kinda want to steal it from him

daredevil IS in the civil war comics so if they make another movie in addition to This civil war movie then daredevil is bound to show up-
Jackie Bradley, Jr. ended Boston's Ben Affleck birthday losing streak, but unfortunately he can't erase Daredevil from movie history.
Ok.. my work colleagues have persuaded me to give Daredevil a 2nd shot.. I didn't think the first few episodes were better than the Movie
what if there's secretly a daredevil cameo in cw that we'll never know about until the movie
Jysk needs to stop playing "Bring me to life" by Evanescence. People wanna shop for furniture, not be in that mid 2000's Daredevil movie
If the series is like the movie, there should be a female vigilante alongside #Daredevil
It's literally hard to believe that Matt Murdock in "Daredevil" show was Tristan in "StarDust" movie.
i kinda don't care about the doctor strange movie, probably less so now since they sniped night nurse from daredevil for it.

Fun fact I nearly cried during the Daredevil movie because I was just like what the hell is this and it was upsetting.
"IM3 was the worst marvel movie" Have you SEEN the 2003 daredevil?? Like, are you aware that this movie happened???
I wish I could watch the Daredevil series for the first time again. I also wish I could forget that I ever watched the 2003 Daredevil movie.
As a longtime fan of #Daredevil comics, I had hoped the movie would be half as good as the #Netflix series... #bombdiggity

outside of ghost rider 2, it might be the worst comic book movie ever made. yes, worse than daredevil and green lantern
in other news I've watched both captain americas and now the daredevil movie I'm trash

You mean to tell me the studio that made Daredevil, Elektra, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, X3, & 2 Fantastic Fours made a bad movie?
@jasondashbailey @scottrenshaw Yeah. The Netflix Daredevil show wasn't a reboot of the Affleck movie right?
Why they use the black dudes character? And Catwoman ain't the last Superhero flop. Daredevil and first Hulk movie came out after Catwoman..

I know you like that 2003 Daredevil movie, my love, but the Netflix version is clearly better #BadWeddingVows @midnight
Daredevil is on par with the first Iron Man movie for me. I can't stop thinking about it.

Fox bought movie rights to X-Men and Fantastic 4 and Daredevil because Marvel was broke at the time.

Instead of watching a new show, or movie, or anime, or NEW ANYTHING, I've decided to re-watch Daredevil. Then Sherlock...Buddha save me.
@migueldeicaza Daredevil on Netflix. (1) Not a movie. (2) Not super but still hero. (3) Only takes care of a neighborhood, not the world.

before i die, i NEED to see team red unite on the big screen, idc if it's on daredevil or on a deadpool/spider man movie i just NEED IT
"Fantastic 4" is the worse marvel movie ever. Daredevil was better.
The daredevil show is infinitely better than the movie.
cuz Daredevil was 'OMG W0rsT SupaHEro movie evahhh!!1' and I adore that film. Director's Cut more than Theatrical, but neither are BAD
Was the Daredevil movie really bad? I dont remember
This was worst than affleck in daredevil and green lantern. No sice worst superhero movie I can recall

Scared af to watch Fantastic Four. Did worse than the Daredevil movie I see.
Daredevil, Elektra, Howard the Duck, the previous Fantastic Four movies all have a higher rating than the new Fantastic Four movie.
@mrjafri marvel got the rights back to daredevil and made a great TV show, they could make a great F4 movie
I just love how Netflix has the films about other characters associated with Daredevil but not the Daredevil movie.
i request a new and improved daredevil movie starring the current actor from the daredevil netflix series @Marvel make it happen pls n thank
We watched the daredevil movie and it's just so bad so so bad
Think about it.... Daredevil movie, trash. TV show, amazing.
also no superhero movie can be worse than Ben affleck daredevil so (sticking tongue out)
I know that its a shame that I have the 2 Disc Special Edition of the #Daredevil movie but a true collector and #Marvel fan needs everything
@GoodBadFlicks was right. Daredevil's director cut was essentially an entirely new movie. A complete one, this time.
Every non Marvel Studios movie that got bad reviews, I still liked (Ghost Rider, ASM2, even Daredevil). But the new FF, can't defend, sorry
I would laugh so hard if I ever went to see a movie and for some unexpected reason they put an episode of Daredevil on instead of the film.
Basically finished the DareDevil series in one sitting LOL. Felt like a really long movie. Overall it was pretty good. End suit was tacky...
The fact I will be going to the cinema to see another Marvel movie but with a Daredevil top on.

I hope fantastic four is the next daredevil. Really bad theatrical movie but the director's cut is so much better it helps the movie.
Not gonna lie, #Daredevil, the show not the movie, actor's got a really nice ass.

Daredevil is actually a good show unlike the atrocity that was the called a movie years back.
to watch a movie or to rewatch daredevil, that is the question
This is worse than the Daredevil Movie, the first "Fantastic" movie, The Phantom Menace, The Super Mario Bros movie... Just depressing
@GoodBadFlicks Picked up the director's cut of the Daredevil movie for $5. Sounds like a good deal.
Should've trusted my gut instinct on not watching #FantasticFour, but congrats, Daredevil, you're not the worst Marvel movie I've seen now.
Like really his enemy is a paper clip throwing sniper ... Daredevil absolutely worse marvel movie
Daredevil has to be hands down thee worst super hero movie ever beadle why you even wasting time watching this crap
I'm about to make my grandma watch Daredevil. She loves Ben Affleck but she hates the movie. She said that wasn't the one she read.
Ain't no way on God Emperor Doom's green earth fantastic four is worse than the Daredevil movie
So they took nothing from the movie to the show #Daredevil Its good though.
Fantastic Four might be the worst superhero movie letdown since Green Lantern or Daredevil but I didn't have hopes for those movies
@indulgentgeek @cougar78 I'd give anything for that to be a thing I think this movie's going to do that. That's how daredevil was given back
*forgets that there was ever a Daredevil movie*
Fox is the absolute worst movie studio when it comes to superheroes. 3 bad Fantastic Fours, 2 bad Ghost Riders, Daredevil, Elektra, X3. Ugh.
I could be wrong, because it's been many years since I've seen Daredevil, but Fantastic Four might be the worst Marvel movie yet.
Y'know, Fox also had their hand in the first DAREDEVIL movie, ELEKTRA, and X-MEN 3. Why's anyone surprise the latest FANTASTIC FOUR sucks?
@thecherness I have a feeling Trank's cut will be like the director's cut of Daredevil - same bad movie, just longer and with Coolio.
@SuperheroFeed movie would have to be age of ultron but if we can count tv series as well then daredevil
All I'm seeing are bad reviews for Fantastic Four....might have to give it a miss if they're saying it's worse than the daredevil movie
F4 is badest than daredevil movie But daredevil movie isnt that bad
Fantastic Four right rhere with Daredevil Movie with Ben Affleck
So fox pulled a Daredevil and took out about 20-30minutes of the fantastic four. movie ?
The movie 'Daredevil' earned in total only a bit more than 'The Avengers' did in a single day.
Fox let Marvel have Daredevil back because they had zero, I REPEAT, ZERO plans for a DD movie. They have/had plans for Fantastic Four.
@ponfarr4lovers IM HOPING!!! I've just never seen a superhero movie with such low ratings even daredevil had 44%
@JakeBaldino He then blows the smoke into Trump's face and explains how the 2003 Daredevil movie wasn't that bad.
And the Daredevil movie
Like this is worse than the original fantastic 4 movies and the daredevil movie. I don't even think I wanna stay to watch the credits
I'm watching LEGACY and finally seeing some Daredevil qualities in Cox's older work, but I dunno. TV movie that cuts "2 yrs" a bit short.

The netflix series for daredevil is sooooo good. Much better than the movie. And the movie was excellent.
#Daredevil the show is better than the movie!
I've only seen bad things about the new Fantastic Four movie. So I'll just rewatch the Daredevil Netflix series.
@blakjordanbreen @Smooth_Orator Same thing Fox did with DareDevil. I just wants the F4 characters back w/ Marvel for future movie purposes.
Watching Daredevil and the first 5 minutes was better then the entire Affleck movie.
@nonprophetess Daredevil (the Netflix series, not that shitburger of a movie) is fucking fantastic.
@Linaanatorr the DareDevil series is good and this movie called "The Nightcrawler" with Jake Gyllenhaal is dope but it starts off slow
I forgot how good of a movie Daredevil is.
@IanGWB @racoavfc all I remember is that nu metal rap part of that song in the daredevil movie
Mom: why are you such a daredevil? Me: c'mon, it's just basejumping off the Golden Gate bridge. It's not like I'm going to a movie theater!
@bisexualalpha ehhh it's ok in like, an old marvel movie way (think maybe daredevil movie only a bit better)
I thought DareDevil on Netflix was just a movie but noo it's a season long, hell yea!!
Top Daredevil stunts in 2015: 1.) Kitesurfing 2.) Basejumping 3.) Going to an American movie theater without a bulletproof vest.
Disappointed really, I guess this is another Daredevil case, a movie that I enjoyed it pretty much, but everyone else hated it.
FIRST EVER FRIEND TO LIKE DAREDEVIL THE MOVIE?! Finally. " @radnovales @biirod yes. Loved it"
@InSessionFilm Spider Man 2 is so easily the best superhero movie so far overall. But the Director's Cut of Daredevil is distant 2nd for me
I'm sure Ant-Man and Deadpool will be better than the atrocities that were Daredevil (movie), Elecktra and Ghost Rider.
Have you ever and woke up from a nightmare and realize it is actually real? Well that happened when I woke watching the Daredevil movie
Deadpool would have been better as an MCU netflix series Daredevil-style and the fact that I have realized this is ruining the movie for me.
Now that I am finished with Sense8, I should probably watch Daredevil. After Ant-man, I feel a Marvel movie... http://fb.me/BwEt8n3W 
I just watched Daredevil for the first time on TBS. Good lord, that movie really was a disaster. So many obvious... http://fb.me/7NWMjc4Yb 
Michael Clarke Duncan, god rest his soul, was wasted in this movie. Yes, somehow the main villain of the movie was underused. #Daredevil
i really really hope that marvel are considering daredevil seriously daredevil needs a movie
Daredevil with Ben Affleck is a badass movie. I think he'll make a great Batman
Watching bad movie Daredevil lmaooooo
The movie Daredevil is dope
how is the daredevil TV series way better than the movie back in '03
On that Buzz Hahaha This song was a damn waste on that Daredevil movie zzz mean jam. Glad they used… https://instagram.com/p/5_hwojC81i/ 
Just now watching the daredevil movie and Ellen Pompeo is in it
Daredevil is my favorite movie its bad ass
I love the movie daredevil so much it's been a minute since I've watched it
And I am watching DareDevil (movie) and I don't know what I am doing with myself tonight.
DareDevil is still that movie
The daredevil movie is on. I understand why no one liked it. The TV show is SOOOOO much better.
U know you're in a hospital when you're watching the movie daredevil bc why would I watch this movie on my free time
@BittrScrptReadr this is what every Deadpool fan wants. Most comic fans like to forget the first Wolverine movie happened. Like Daredevil
Related: the kid who plays young Matt in the Daredevil movie looks exactly like a baby Charlie Cox, this is incredible.
Oh, boy. I tuned in just in time to see the Daredevil movie. This should be fun...
@Jam883 the Ghost Rider movie have potential but the movie flops especially the 2nd movie. Really hoping for a Netflix reboot like Daredevil
tomorrow I'm gonna have a movie marathon and watch all those old marvel movies from the 2000's like daredevil and fantastic 4 and spiderman
I want there to be a deadpool show like The Flash or DareDevil, one movie of Deadpool awesomeness isn't enough :L
this is who u need to add for the second movie daredevil and spider-man goodnight @deadpoolmovie
Antman, Elektra, Daredevil & Deadpool get a movie, but still no Black Panther? Smh...
Can't see the Batman vs Superman movie being good I mean Ben Affleck couldn't pull off being Daredevil what makes u think he can be Batman?
me, watching a 3 minute trailer for the deadpool movie: so where's daredevil
Daredevil was the first superhero movie that influenced my love for them now back when I was like 9
@ABigDumbBaby @GregCapullo Tim you look like Bullseye from the crappy Daredevil movie.
RT: tony_DAbaloney: BenAffleck Daredevil was a great movie!! Especially for its time #Favorite #MarvelSuperhero… http://goo.gl/JLlVzb 
The movie is also only 100 mins long- shorter movies can be good, but the last superhero movie with that length that I watched was Daredevil
I've only seen 4 episodes of daredevil it would have been 5 but netflix kept crashing so we watched teen beach movie
@Obiba_Qwajo lol. Ever watched the movie daredevil? Amazing what a blind man can do
The reason why I don't want to watch Daredevil the tv show is because the movie in 2003 was the most horrible movie I ever watched.
You think @BenAffleck watches @Daredevil on #Netflix and cries a little? Y'know... b/c his movie was a debacle but the show is pretty good
I had a FIT when I heard Ben Afflect was going to be Batman for the movie, cause Daredevil. However, seeing the trailer, I ain't mad at all.

Here's a confession: I love the original Daredevil movie. I don't know why people hate it
I know that I cant say anything before watching the movie but only because its ryan reynolds, for me daredevil is better than deadpool...
Finally I know what movie that dude was in before . He was kingpin in daredevil series.

So #bennifer lasted from #daredevil the movie to #daredevil the @netflix series
@kitlerc Watch Daredevil anyways. It's awesome. (unless we're talking about the Affleck movie, in which case we should have an intervention)

- the #DareDevil series is like wayyyyyy better than the movie... Movie was dumb to me. I like the series a lot better.
The only time DeKnight got a no on #Daredevil was Rosario Dawson's character name. Marvel has movie plans for Linda Carter/Night Nurse.
Rosario Dawson's character was going to be night nurse from comics, but movie side had plans for her. Name was changed. #Daredevil #TCA15
DeKnight says the only big time they were restricted in #Daredevil was using Night Nurse’s comic name (Linda Carter) due to movie plans.
a daredevil movie Charlie would be so cute and excited omgmf

And that was only because they did #Daredevil first, just to introduce #Elektra as her love, that was the reason why they did her movie lbh
For years and years I was afraid to watch the movie Hostel when in fact I've seen much worse in Daredevil and Game of Thrones.
@arisrmd @torantula is it unforgivable if I can't recall Daredevil's movie?
Alright like Ant Man was at least better than the Daredevil movie. And the first Captain movie. And the first Hulk movie (lol)
Finally starting @Daredevil on Netflix...here's to hoping it's not the abomination the movie was.
I wonder when Marvel is gonna make a reference to the Defenders (Daredevil, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage) in a movie.
Daredevil is a badass movie.
@JakeGratto I thought everyone agreed to pretend the Daredevil movie never happened

@jjensen1998 daredevil on Netflix literally resurrected it after how bad this movie was
Watching Daredevil(the movie) eeh lol on TNT, with Michael Clarke Duncan, #RIP
@_Ruckerish yep yep yep STEALS THE MOVIE so fucking good that's when i became a fan SAW DAREDEVIL IN THEATERS IT'S STILL GREAT FUCK HATERS
Daredevil has to be my favorite marvel movie
Daredevil is quite possibly the worst movie ever made in the entire history of film. I mean...like...abysmal.
I'm so pissed the daredevil movie is on right now lol
The old Daredevil movie screams 2003 so much.
Dawg I forgot how garbage the Daredevil movie was lmaoo got Elektra cutting sand bags to the rhythm of Emo music
suddenly a haunting evanescence song is playing during a funeral scene in daredevil: the movie and I can't take this
The Ben Affleck Daredevil movie is so good
watching daredevil. love this movie.
Pretty sure the 2003 movie Daredevil started my superhero obsession. Like this movie was badass to third grade Stasi.
Bruh I'm watching Daredevil for the first time since I was like 10..... This movie is so corny.
u know when you're flipping channels & you hit a bad movie & it's just like..I guess this is how it has to be anyway I found daredevil movie
When i was younger, i had enough sense to hate that awful Daredevil movie w/ #BenAffleck but i liked fantastic four i blame #ChrisEvans

I'll admit. The Daredevil series is surprisingly good. Kingpin is a more intriguing character than any villain Marvel has done in a movie.

ok but legit tho if they ever put Charlie Cox's daredevil in an mcu movie....
I'm just glad @Marvel didn't give up on Daredevil after the movie. The series is a real treat.

I would be super excited 4 batman v superman movie but I don't like Ben affleck. He already ruined the daredevil movie now he's batman? No.
My theory is, that, much like Ben Affleck's Batman, Daredevil could have been great if they just never have him his own movie.
when will i get daredevil and deadpool in movie form or tv i dont care i wANT IT

Tonight's movie is Ben Affleck's much maligned Daredevil. Have to admit I've always rather liked it.
@DefGrappler Affleck is a better actor than Lee Pace. Daredevil was a bad movie. You could have any actor in that role and it would be bad.
I wish @daredevil was at @Comic_Con. There's this space which no movie or TV show panel can fill other than daredevil
Deadpool has always been my favourite Superhero & Im looking forward to the movie but I wish it would be a Daredevil style TV series instead

#BatmanvSuperman Movie is all hinged on whether Ben can pull off acting all "angsty", or will he be acting in 'daredevil range' again.
With Ben Affleck playing Dark Knight in Batman v Superman, hope Christian Bale plays a cameo in the movie as Daredevil
@electricceleste OR DAREDEVIL ITS NOT A DISAPPOINTMENT LIKE THE BEN AFFLECK MOVIE

I want to see Batfleck vs Daredevil Afleck vs Hollywoodland Superman Afleck. Even if the movie stink i still see somthig bad hapen to Afleck
Hating on daredevil smh that movie made me fall in love with Ben when I was little
The daredevil TV show is more accurate to the comics and better overall quality than literally every marvel movie
Did Ben Affleck do that daredevil movie as well? Is he destined to do only shitty superhero movies?
I'd rather have a movie about the Chinese Gambit who's Daredevil's new sidekick.
@cbanks420lol I still don't know how I feel about that movie. Ben Affleck as batman? You think we forgot daredevil?

Rj & I are having a txt argument over the Daredevil movie. It's the little things like this I'll miss when he's gone.
If #BatmanvSuperman turns out as great as the trailer looks then all will be forgiven for that piece of Daredevil movie Ben Affleck was in
It wasnt even like Ben Affleck acted bad in Daredevil. movie production in general was poor. Blame the Director & film team. Not the actor
there was a reason why daredevil (the movie) was such a flop
Ben Affleck honestly can't afford to mess up batman v superman after Daredevil cause that movie was trash Hopefully he redeems himself
Exactly, wasn't Ben's fault from the jump, that movie was just horrible, plus the Director's Cut version of Daredevil was better anyway
Is the Daredevil show on Netflix better than the movie somebody PLEASE give me that info.

As cool as the batman and superman movie I can't get over the fact that casting Gal Gadot for Wonder Woman is like casting me for Daredevil.
job with that Daredevil movie. Also that Man of Steel movie was horrendous. So I'm iffy about seeing any sequels.
@ScottNiswander @ricky_ii afflec has to be a better batman than a daredevil. that is all the confidence i have in this movie
Batman fans are getting the Batman they deserve. May the spirit of the Daredevil movie wash over Ben Affleck. Gigli too
So what’s daredevil doing in the new batman vs superman movie?
That Daredevil movie way in the past now. Pretty sure Ben Affleck will ace this role as Batman.
They for real needa remake daredevil as a movie
@jcotera1106 @DCComics imagine a 13 episode movie like Daredevil but for Batman or Weapon X program... Griddy no censors
@robertcyoung Though, it could be like the movie Daredevil vs Netflix Daredevil? Well... probably not...
@Jason6440 but if you watch the directors cut of daredevil its sick. They cut scenes that make the movie work.

@IMDb After that terrible Daredevil movie, I don't trust him with superheroes.

Between Deadpool getting his movie, The Punisher returning in S2 of Daredevil, and Wesley Snipes in talks for another Blade...
Man, Punisher and Elektra are coming to Daredevil Season 2, Blade 4 is in discussion, might we get our first 16/18 rated MCU movie soon?

Blade on Daredevil? Yes please. A Blade movie? Yes please. A Blade Netflix series? Yes please.
It's daredevil, it's fun, it's clever. There's a B Movie element that still survives, Capaldi says #comiccon
@AgeOfMyself Yeah and that movie Is just crazy and doesn't fit the MCU But Blade Should be in Netflix Because Look At Daredevil

@KarthikKakarala We can definitely work out the details. Maybe a review of the Daredevil review, or the Avengers movie reviews, too.
What even is the Daredevil movie I haven't watched it but what even.
@sassniss The Daredevil movie kind of disappointed me but, you know, there's nothing like the TV show and Charlie Cox's Matt :)
After seeing the Daredevil and the Elektra movie I'm getting more and more excited about #Daredevil season 2.

After the failure of the movie Daredevil, Ben Affleck vowed to never play another Superhero in film.

@stone_hands83 this daredevil blows the movie out of the water
Daredevil the best movie ever made man

This Netflix series, #Daredevil , has almost made me forget Ben Affleck was once in a movie of a similar title. #TVisMuchBetter

I want to watch the Daredevil movie but at the same time I don't because everyone says it's really bad so yeah.
@TheAmitie Please don't ask me what baseball team I root for. Or about whether or not I think the Affleck Daredevil movie is good.
@Unblock_Us TV Show - Daredevil Movie - Edge of Tomorrow #unblockus
I'm about to just have a movie day after I finish daredevil
If you've already played a superhero in a movie you shouldn't be eligible to play a different one as well. Ben. Affleck. Is. DAREDEVIL!
Watching the DareDevil movie again and totally forgot @ThatKevinSmith had a quick cameo

I know I'm all about #Daredevil, but... holy crap, I cannot wait for this movie. :-) #deadpool https://twitter.com/superherofeed/status/618800691528790017 …
I'm easily more excited for Season 2 of Daredevil than any other upcoming Marvel movie.
@PhotosByBeanz i agree the movie was trash but she wasnt that bad. I guess it's compared to affleck as Daredevil.
@mt_pathfinder Also it looks like the teenage Matt Murdock in the Daredevil movie
@IamKarlwithaK So Daredevil was a breath of fresh air after seeing how superhero movies are gaining casts of 8+ cape characters per movie.
First look at the new Ghostbusters movie, Daredevil Se2 starts filming and Fallout 4 wins E3’s best of show. https://axbymag.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/coffee-time-news-080715/ …
Daredevil don't really enjoy dat movie " @thatsureboy: Punisher, Elektra and The Daredevil."
>Electra confirmed for Daredevil S2 Skeptical since that was what potentially made the movie silly but we’ll see.
#YouDidWhatForTacos I sat through Cat Woman, Steel, Daredevil, and the George Clooney Batman. Hate when movie night's on taco Tuesday.
#JenniferGarner was terrible in the #Daredevil movie, but I thought she was ok in the actual #Elektra film - even if the film was really bad
Next year we will see Civil War , Batman fighting Superman, a Deadpool Movie, Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse, And Daredevil fighting The Punisher
Daredevil on Netflix is sooo much better than the movie
#Daredevil Show so much better than that horrible movie they made w Ben Affleck. No clue why he's the new Batman didn't DC comics learn
