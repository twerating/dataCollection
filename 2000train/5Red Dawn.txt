MOVIE REVIEW: "Red Dawn" (2012) Remake http://goo.gl/ccA7z  #PrepperTalk #doomsdaypreppers #preppers #prepping #Survivalist #TEOTWAWKI
Was gonna watch a Christmas movie to get in the holiday mood but then I saw that Red Dawn is on T.V.
Red Dawn will always be my fav movie
Are Americans really terrified about an attack from North Korea? The movie Red Dawn wasn't a convincing scenario btw #GOPDebate
damn red dawn is a really good movie
Honestly I have a hard time believing @tedcruz 's favorite movie isn't the "documentary" Red Dawn http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/14/ted-cruz-princess-bride-mandy-patinkin/?_r=2&utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link …
Red Dawn=Best movie ever.
"Smack bang in the middle of dub dub tre as the douchebags have been saying." @RiffTrax Red Dawn is a great movie for Christmas.
In the comic book rendition of how the world works in your brain, you see something like the movie Red Dawn. It don't happen like that.
just bought something at. She seen her friend. I tell you what. It looks like the movie Red Dawn out there sometimes.

Why do people hate the Red Dawn remake? This is a good movie. Sure, it's an unnecessary remake, but still, it's a good movie either way.
As much as that Red Dawn movie was mass fiction if something like that did happen - it would happen with a guy like Justin as leader
After Red Dawn, Point Break, Roadhouse and now Dirty Dancing, the only Swayze movie left to remake would be Ghost.
If #isis wants to come to America I think they first need to watch the movie Red Dawn the one with Patrick Swayze of course. #wolverines
Red Dawn is a good movie one of my favs
The RedDawn Movie Is
Red dawn is such a good movie
The new Red Dawn could've been such a great movie, but as usual, they blow it.
@BewareOfMyBeard the old one. My movie has the old Red Dawn and Navy Seals together. They're both so good
The 2012 version of Red Dawn is on TV now. It seems more far-fetched than that alien invasion movie 5th Wave
I like the movie red dawn. They only gave it 1 star tho
Red dawn=Great movie
OMG red dawn is on, red dawn is my fav movie
Watching the movie Red Dawn. Or as I like to call it, pre-planning. G #thewaronterror #iftheywantafighttheyllgetone #theemslounge
I'm convinced the dude that plays Pita, is a pussy in every movie, he doesn't even pull the trigger in Red Dawn either..
Red Dawn is such a badass movie. Every time it comes on I HAVE to watch it!
Red Dawn was really a good movie in my opinion
Red Dawn is my favorite movie ever
If you don't like the movie Red Dawn, we have some problems.
Really really like the movie Red Dawn
lmao the movie Red Dawn is insane. Josh Peck got me too weak, cant picture him in anything but Drake & Josh
Currently watching the 2012 Red Dawn movie.. My mom asked if it was the one with Thor and Josh #nailedit
Have none of there Democrats seen the movie Red Dawn? The old or the remake? They tell the same story about privare gun ownership. #Libtards

"Let's make a movie that is half One Tree Hill and half Red Dawn. The bad guys will be Asian. This is a good idea." pic.twitter.com/mLivomTaMV
I want people in my neighborhood to own guns. Red Dawn wasn't just a movie, it was a fact of life.
REMEMBER the Original RED DAWN movie. If ISIS invades, that will be our world. WE MUST DEFEND & EXPEL the INVADERS. OR WE DIE DOING IT #RT

Red Dawn (4/9) Movie CLIP - Guerilla Warfare (1984) HD http://fb.me/2pZBbIblo 
@LeaKThompson. Watching you in "Red Dawn" what a frighteningly good movie. Love seeing you then and now
I had never seen the original Red Dawn before today. It's a terrible, terrible movie. #WhyOnEarthWouldTheyTryToRemakeIt?
This "Red Dawn" movie is a joke. Can't believe Chris Hemsworth's in it
Red Dawn (1984) is a Christmas movie, right? #Wolverines!
Weird red dawn over London right now, like a lighting effect on a movie. Surreal!
@ChrisCuomo @Kim_Bruning <====== Has been watching the movie "Red Dawn" again.

.... And if the Black Helicopters come do you really think you and the HS FBall team stand a chance? Red Dawn WAS A MOVIE! #smartguncontrol
@vicenews Don't forget 1984 Red Dawn movie! By your lame phrasing America is as good as occupied territory of the USSR, precursor of Russia.
ME: [dying from a gunshot] this was worth it in case Red Dawn, a movie, happens
Let's be real people don't want to give up their guns cause they're afraid the Red Dawn movie will come true
Red dawn, Just like the movie it's coming to America! The leading roles of this event will be American Patriots fighting for liberty&freedom
Pretty decent Aussie/Teen Red Dawn-type movie Tomorrow When The War Began http://fb.me/7A5THoVnL 
I can't think of a better Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey movie than Red Dawn.
A great movie to watch is the Red Dawn 2012 version
This is going to give me nightmares just like Red Dawn did when I was a kid. No horror movie ever scared me in... http://fb.me/4Pdt7SLHB 
I've been banned from watching Red Dawn with Hubz and MiniBeast. I made the comment, "There are a lot of cute guys in this movie." #JustNow
So... They've remade Red Dawn. Point Break is on the way. If they'll redo The Lost Boys, my early movie life is just about covered
@DrBlueJeanns actually Red Dawn probably gets it right as silly as that movie is
@TedAbbie @joe_perdue08 @vpete12 @alexboss13 @atpowell3 Remake of "Red Dawn" shoulda been in Deep South, would've been a short movie though.
@da_breezman worst remake I've ever seen has to be Red Dawn, which was a remake of a mediocre movie to begin with.
Red Dawn (original version) is a great Thanksgiving Day movie. I'm marathoning #Jericho because it's awesome.
@CaptBeezer Were you convinced 'Red Dawn' would happen? I always went to school with a 'survival tin' after that movie. #Wolverines!
SQotD: Red Dawn, now Point Break. Do we really need a remake of every Patrick Swayze movie?
@joemierzwa @9NEWS You're right: on Aug. 10, 1984, Red Dawn became the first PG-13 rated movie.
gonna take more than a rocky movie or red dawn to convince the world russia are the enemy now thanks to turkey
My parents just asked me if I'm a "Russian sympathizer" Like really, it's not the 80s anymore, red dawn is a fictional movie /rant
He's a groveling fool. He's "Mayor Bates" in the original Red Dawn movie https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/669164579763716097 …
@BarackObama reminds me of the mayor in the movie Red Dawn. Afraid to fight the enemy and kissing ass to save his position. Shout WOLVERINES
I hope you don't go see the new Point Break movie. Makes the Red Dawn remake look like Citizen Kane. #JustSayNo
I'm still remembering how disappointing it is that Red Dawn (the original) is my favorite movie and I still do not know why. WOLVERINES!
Red dawn is such a good movie
Watching Red Dawn for the first time, funny they play that movie in times like this..
Red Dawn: A movie where a group of kids defeated North Korea

Kirk Cameron's Left Behind was truly a weird movie. It's like the Book of Revelations crossed with Red Dawn and The Devil's Advocate.

@adamjohnsonNYC @DavidKlion fair enough. Good list btw. Though for me it's RED DAWN #1. Though that's true of all movie lists. Wolverine!
@BenBlanchard6 that's a Heath movie and as such is sacred. It'd be like when they tried to remake Red Dawn without Swayze, without magic.

Now that the #ColdWar is back on, can we at least get a halfway decent remake to the movie Red Dawn? And can we clone Patrick Swayze too?

Fun Fact: The original Red Dawn was developed as a "Wolverine" movie until Marvel Comics backed out of the agreement.

1984: The PG-13 rating is introduced by the MPAA, with Red Dawn becoming the first movie to receive the ranking. #thisdayinhistory
Watching Red Dawn from 1984. Movie is About the Invasion of the USA saw it when I was a Kid around the Time it came out
Red Dawn was the first PG-13 assigned movie because the blood and violence in Gremlins & Indian Jones was too much for the little chillens
#OTD in 1984 @MPAA established the PG-13 rating. The first PG-13 movie, ‘Red Dawn’, was released in August that year. pic.twitter.com/GjgHh3v3q8
This day in 1984, the movie rating PG-13 debuted. The first PG-13 movie was Red Dawn with Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen #ThisDayInHistory
Red Dawn is basically a movie about terrorists attacking peace keeping forces deployed to the U.S.
1984 July 1st introduced the new rating systems for movie pg-13 Red Dawn was first pg-13 movie
On 8/10/1983, Red Dawn, starring Patrick Swayze & @charliesheen became the first-ever PG-13 movie released in theaters #WhatILearnedToday

God. Patton is the ur-Cold War movie. Red Dawn plus. Just amazing.
Red Dawn is probably the best movie I've ever seen.
RED DAWN IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE HOLYY GARBANZO BEANS
This Red Dawn movie starts pretty abruptly
So this movie red dawn is making think I may need a truck instead
And the award for "worst movie plot in the planets history" goes to Red Dawn.
Red dawn is such a good movie
If you've seen Red Dawn, the movie of the American insurgents, replace Wolverines with Allahu Akbar and you have Kandahar '03.
The movie Red Dawn would be 10x better without Josh Peck. He shoulda just stuck with Drake and Josh.
Because I have older brothers: the movies Deer Hunter and Red Dawn are the same movie
The original red dawn movie is an all time great
watching red dawn for our Christmas movie
Red dawn is probably my favorite movie
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/DxamzMUFvZ8?a  Red Dawn (1/9) Movie CLIP - Paratrooper Invasion (1984) HD
Yeah I get it- you got an IT degree in the late 90's & you've seen the new Red Dawn movie- that doesn't make you a North Korea expert.
That Red Dawn is a horrible movie that took two hours of my life and I'm still looking for an opportunity to go hulk on it.
@IAMZENAS We CREATED a movie about that. Check out the remake of Red Dawn.
John Milius's RED DAWN is a classic example of a movie where its detractors are right on almost every score, and yet it still works somehow.
Red dawn is my #1 favorite movie of all time! No doubt, best movie ever filmed
Soo the movie Red Dawn just broke my heart.
Red Dawn is a decent movie, right until Chris Hemsworth dies
red dawn is such a gr8 movie
I wonder what movie will North Korea let us watch this holiday season? Probably Red Dawn..
it's a wrap for us now. it's gonna be like tha movie "Red Dawn"
All this North Korea stuff might turn into Red Dawn…. The movie is slick starting to play out in real life…
If I would've known beforehand that Chris Hemsworth dies in Red Dawn I wouldn't have watched it. Now I'm in pain from watching that movie
Josh Peck ruined the movie red dawn smh
Red dawn is a great movie
I've never seen a better movie than Red Dawn!! #bestmovieever #JoshPeck #HeGotSkinny #TweetLikeTyDay
It's okay for Korea to release Red Dawn where they try and take over America but we can't release our movie... #Unbelievable RELEASE IT!!!!
Red Dawn may be the most BA movie I've ever watched
The movie red dawn is sick
The Red Dawn movie is about to become a real life scenario.
Red dawn is the ultimate bros before hoes movie
@greta @WhiteHouse @FoxNews Just remember "Red Dawn" The original movie against gun control! Watch it and you will see
@ParasiteCoD Its gonna be like the movie Red Dawn where the koreans come to the US and borrow our internet and then josh peck saves theWorld
“ @YngBlkPin_Up: Son. If the Koreans come for us…”that movie red dawn...lmao
North Korea and US is at it again, hope we don't really have to experience that movie red dawn for real, well sha for now we can say its 1-1
Watching Red Dawn on @netflix. My wife walked in during this scene & said, "What movie is this? Footloose?" pic.twitter.com/W2aMNhALDk
Don't forget that this started years ago with the remake of Red Dawn (shitty fucking movie that I will never watch).
Why is North Korea concerned about The Interview and not Red Dawn? That movie is pretty iffy too.
Red Dawn is a tight movie
North Korea is about to make the movie Red Dawn come true....
Red Dawn is always the movie to watch.
Red dawn is good movie
Red dawn is official my new favorite movie
I love the movie Red Dawn
@FreshBlackz watch Red Dawn the modern version it's a great movie !!
Remember a lot of white people's reaction to Red Dawn? That movie got them so hyped to want to kill Korean folk, it was very scary.
The movie Red Dawn makes me want to kill Koreans.
“ @Jazlezz: I love the movie red dawn”
Had no idea @markschlereth was in the movie Red Dawn. He was the coach of the high school team and let his QB walk all over him.
MOVIE REVIEW: "Red Dawn" (1984) http://goo.gl/3V4U4  #PrepperTalk #prepping #preppers #Survivalist #TEOTWAWKI #doomsdaypreppers
like I was surprised nothing bad came out of the newest Red Dawn and people are screaming bloody murder about this movie being cancelled
"Red Dawn" round 2 #merica #TheInterview i wasn't too excited, but now i have to seek this movie out to support freedom of speech
Ten minutes in and Red Dawn seems like just the dumb action movie I was looking for.
This one girl I know has been in 5 seconds of a movie and has played as an extra in red dawn AND SHE THINKS SHES SO FAMOUS I WANT TO DIE
Red Dawn #Movie
The original red dawn might be the worst movie I have ever seen
red dawn is the best movie I swear
Red Dawn: teens fight off NKor invasion. The Interview: movie execs surrender to NKor saber rattle. Both ridiculously implausible storylines
the last movie about North Korea we ever get might be the 2012 Red Dawn remake. y’all should get on that, it’s pretty good
So the the N Koreans didn't find the movie Red Dawn offensive after we wiped out their entire military on U.S. Soil????? #tcot
The reason red dawn didn't get any flack is because it was a terrible movie.
Red Dawn is such a great movie, both the original and the remake.
what if the movie red dawn predicted what's going to happen now and north Korea is going to attack the US #mindblown
if you haven't seen the movie red dawn... keep it that way
The situation we're right now with North Korea is exactly like the movie Red Dawn, watch it
Red Dawn TRAILER (2012) Chris Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson Movie HD: http://youtu.be/nGoe7BdGdlg  via @YouTube
Mr. Bennett told Carpenter all we had to do was watch a Christmas movie or whatever, so we're watching Red Dawn.
Red dawn would be such a better movie is josh peck knew how to act.
As a child of the '80s, the real Red Dawn is one of my faves. First movie w/Patrick Swayze & Jennifer Grey together, not Dirty Dancing
Anonymous should go fuck those North Korea hackers up with some truth. It's a movie. Who gives a shit. Remember Red Dawn? ROCKY IV?
Since we made the movie Red Dawn about North Koreans attacking us, showing The Interview should just make us even with them
Movie plans for this weekend: - Every clip available for The Interview - Team America - Red Dawn (2012... http://tmblr.co/ZyAtZw1YN2rje 
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/pzAgyr64h-A?a  Film Fact - Red Dawn (2012) Chris Hemsworth Movie HD
Needs to be re-retweeted RT @TimAlbrechtIA: You know what movie release wasn’t canceled? Red Dawn. Twice. #usa
USA worried bout NKorea attacking us? We all saw the new Red Dawn movie right? We win. Not worried.
@mrgeology @alenesopinions red dawn filmed in my backyard(not exactly) I would not join NRA 4 40 years because of this movie, GO WOLVERINES
Movie where North Korea attacks USA OK (Red Dawn remake). Comedy about CIA having stoners kill leader of North Korea not OK. Got it.
Damn brah we made a movie that motivated north Korea to attack (Red Dawn)
I'm now writing a film where 2 actors make a movie & lead us into a war w/ North Korea called Red Dawn 2: the Interview. #TheInterview
I can't believe they're pulling the movie. So stupid, it's not like America has ever created a movie that offends communists (red dawn)...
We watched red dawn till 5am....haha it was a very good movie! I didnt want the ending though.
Red Dawn is low key a great movie! Maybe even high key, I haven't decided yet!
@mrgeology @Trumandie28 Milius (guy who made Red Dawn) was basically blacklisted after that movie. Hollywood made him pay. Bastards.
it's ridiculous that we could release Red Dawn during peak Cold War but got punked over this weak ass Interview movie
The movie Red Dawn is scarily relevant to what's going on with N Korea right now
If I owned a movie theater I'd set up a double feature of "Red Dawn" (the original of course) & "Zero Dark Thirty." See how they like that!
The movie Red Dawn released why can't The interview
If u think red dawn was a good movie you probably don't have ears or eyes or ever seen any other movie made in history
I thought the Red Dawn remake was just a movie, feeling like the North Koreans really did invade
North Korea did not hack or anything when the movie Red Dawn came out. And the interview movie made them mad? That's stupid. 1/2
@FaZeMozey RED DAWN is a great movie
Hate to see free expression fight over what's probably a dreadful movie. Remember Red Dawn remake? Do N. Korea right or do something else.
Though, seriously, North Korea, you CAN have ALL the copies of the las "Red Dawn" movie.
We must make Team America the #1 most-viewed movie in @netflix this Christmas or the terrorists win! Red Dawn is also acceptable.
Damn. Now I need a new movie to complete my North Korea triple feature. Team America, Red Dawn remake, and ..... ?
Is Cuba Castro pissed off of Red Dawn movie from the 1980s???
Red Dawn is such a badass movie
If movie theaters aren't going to show Team America, they should screen "The Great Dictator" or one of the "Red Dawn" movies.
My love for red dawn is unexplainable but basically that movie is straight gold and now it's all mine
Wanted: a theater to find its cojones and schedule a Team America / Red Dawn 2 / Die Another Day movie marathon
I think @Sethrogen should make a movie about Rogan and Franco going Red Dawn on North Korea in lieu of their movie being cancelled
red dawn is my favorite movie ever omg
Why couldn't the North Koreans have taken issue with a movie that truly never should have seen the light of day. Like the Red Dawn reboot.
Guys, Red Dawn was a terrible, terrible fictional movie. I don't think North Koreans can *actually* take over the entire country.
Ok next step is all these movie theaters scheduling screenings of the terrible Red Dawn remake...
@UrbangirlFab @KingSethay @iammikemuse @RealSway Was red dawn a movie about killing their leader? Its irrelevant
@FearDept @YourAnonNews y'all wasn't saying all that when the movie RED DAWN came out
MGM, the studio behind the remake of the 1984 movie "Red Dawn," last year digitally altered the invaders... http://fb.me/6Tfu7mseF 
Shout out today to the poor web content producer that has to watch RED DAWN '12 and find any hint of a movie theater.
Old enough to remember the original Red Dawn movie? Obama and new age Democrats aka neomarxists must hate that movie. #Wolverines
The Interview was a stupid movie to make. People always f-ing w/ folk & then act shocked when something goes down. Ive seen Red Dawn tf.
The movie Red Dawn is exactly how I imagine it would happen if a foreign country tried to invade the USA #Wolverines
Somehow the homefront games and the Red Dawn remake are fine with North Korea, but a James Franco movie isn't.
If we had to lose a movie to the North Koreans, why couldn't it be the remake of "Red Dawn"?
(PT 1/2) Rogen & Franco should make a movie where they're at the premiere for the Interview & N. Korean troops drop in all Red Dawn style.
LT: Also, the official movie of North Korea must be the first hour of the Red Dawn remake.
RED DAWN movie enemy changed from USSR to China to North Korea, now to? @benfritz http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/16/entertainment/la-et-china-red-dawn-20110316 …
We released the movie "red dawn" ... Twice..... Just sayin.
I hate Red Dawn because Chris Hemsworth dies.. just ruins the movie Enough said #ChrisHemsworth #RedDawn #EnoughSaid pic.twitter.com/2QnTUiFmT3
That red dawn movie was alright
We should be vigilant and protect our movie theaters from the wrath of North Korea's Red Dawn and.. oh wait that's right that makes no sense
@ChuckCJohnson Red Dawn scenario def. bogus (was so 4 original movie too) but 2 assume they DON'T have operatives in US is bad bet IMHO.
Red Dawn is a fucking great movie
@ShawnElliott so did the remake of red dawn. they delayed the movie and digitally edited it to change the invading army.
Any movie theater that pulls The Interview should replace it with Red Dawn http://instagram.com/p/wuzWrmPIjM/ 
I would love to see movie theaters play the old "Red Dawn" in place of "The Interview" just to prove a point.
@comebackasfire @weird_jerk but haven't you seen that RED DAWN movie where they invade us?!?!
I can't believe Red Dawn is going to happen just because Rogen and Franco made another bad movie. #TheInterview
14. Making a movie like the Red Dawn remake plays into both paranoia and self-important fantasies of North Korean elite.
This whole fallout around this movie is confusing. Most confusing of all is why didn't it happen for the remake of Red Dawn
Why couldn't the hackers be this pissed off about the red dawn remake? That movie sucked.
@PGourevitch @nytimes 2011 remake of Red Dawn was switched from China to North Korea as the "enemy". The movie was sadly not pulled.
guess nobody told North Korea about the remake of Red Dawn... or maybe they thought that movie was torture enough.
#FilmesQueValemAPenaVer Red Dawn, best movie
James Bond had NoKo as the bad guy, Red Dawn 2 had NoKo as the bad guy, why choose THIS movie to throw a tantrum?
@spidercircle @TheInterview @Sethrogen @JamesFrancoTV we are scared that the events in the newer Red Dawn movie might happen for real.
I feel like if we played that movie It would've been like red dawn but for real
Remember Red Dawn? That movie was so fucking awful. Why wasn't that ever pulled
We make a movie where North Korea actually invaded US (Red Dawn '14) and nothing happens. A comedy is made and they become terrorists.
anyone remember 'The Red Dawn' movie from 2012 about China invading the U.S.?...who's signing off on this stuff?
Red Dawn 2012 Epic movie and really good music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9PJ-0vx0U8 … go watch the move its really good :D
Red Dawn has been retroactively eliminated from movie history due to portrayal of Russian soldiers dying at the hands of The Wolverines.
I don't understand where these North Korean hackers were when they remade Red Dawn. Because that movie was HILARIOUS. @Sethrogen
Will they delete the new Red Dawn from Netflix once they remember NK is in it? Or is Kim Jong-Un like "Who cares, that movie was shit"
Legis: TimAlbrechtIA: You know what movie release wasn’t canceled? Red Dawn. Twice. http://ift.tt/1wiEAj4 
the scary thing is about the movie (red dawn) is that how likely it could happen after watching it i keep looking out the window for planes.
Watched "Red Dawn" for the first time today... Holy shit, that's a damn good movie.
How come no backlash to Red Dawn? Oh, yeah...“The Chilling Effect: Steve Carrell North Korea Movie Canceled http://ift.tt/1sB7YeZ ”
@joestarr187 hahah. but Red Dawn the movie itself wasn't cancelled was it? haha #meta
Sony scraps #TheInterviewMovie... somewhere Gorbachev is mad, because he really didn't like Red Dawn.Or any Bond movie. Or any 80s actioner.
This Sony/The Interview movie stuff is B.S. Where was this outrage over the Red Dawn remake? During Team America? Why now? Over a comedy?
In the Red Dawn remake North Koreans were killed. No threats of bombing movie theaters happened.
Even that second time when it should have been RT @TimAlbrechtIA You know what movie release wasn’t canceled? Red Dawn. Twice. #usa
You know what movie release wasn’t canceled? Red Dawn. Twice. #usa
@ShouldISeeIt every movie theater should be running a triple feature. Team America, the new Red Dawn, and The Interview. #peacethrucomedy
@GregCampNC @BaltJoe @scaruso5555 @razor8ack71 Then you're paranoid, and an idiot. You don't have the firepower - Red Dawn is just a movie.
Maybe the Red Dawn producers can retroactively blame the failure of their movie on this.
So continuing on my movie spree.. Red Dawn is a great movie
Why didn't the North Korean hackers attack RED DAWN remake instead? That way I could have missed that train wreck of a movie.
If you think NK operatives are laying in wait near your local movie theater, you read way too much RWNJ news or paid to see Red Dawn.
Did North Korea make a big fuss over Team America or Red Dawn or that one White House Die Hard movie with North Koreans as the bad guys?
The Red Dawn remake featured North Koreans invading the U.S. The DPRK didn't say a word. Movie flopped and was never heard from again.
Red dawn was a pretty bad ass movie
Wait, the North Koreans are flipping over The Interview but the Red Dawn remake was ok? THAT was the insulting movie...to fans of Red Dawn.
Red Dawn is better than every other movie ever made all time. Any time. Past, present and future. Except for maybe Road House. #swayze
The movie Red Dawn is crazy
@dltnjcbs @daltondawg21 I had a dream me and u relived red dawn the movie but in our hood

@Dosta1 @HankusMackimus you've seen the movie Red Dawn, now replace the foreign invaders with UN Forces and Homeland Security.
No action movie will be better than "red dawn"! That movie got my heart
A kid is really using the movie Red Dawn to defend his anti gun control speech like an idiot ass

Red dawn is a great movie n Chris hemsworth is the hottest person
Red Dawn on in 30 minutes. A movie about a group of teenagers stuck in the woods for months and they STILL won't have sex with Jennifer Grey

SO I JUST WATCHED RED DAWN AND I WAS IN TEARS THAT MOVIE WAS SO GOOD
Red Dawn is such a great movie like I can watch it all the time
Finally watched Red Dawn (from the 1980s). Next 80s movie I should probably watch: Top Gun. How did I miss it?
Mental note: finish watching Red Dawn. Once I start watching a bad movie I have to finish it.
This "Red Dawn" movie remake is such bull unlike the original 1980s version which was basically a documentary...starring Patrick Swayze.
i love the movie red dawn
Red dawn is a fucking sick movie if you like action
there is this movie called Red Dawn and i do not believe it is a thing that is actually real that people paid money to make
