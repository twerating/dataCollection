Divergent is the best movie and book, The maze runner is slightly okay. The hunger games is just boring, but let me not comment.
I'm like 35 minutes into The Hunger Games and I've cried 4 times already. I love this movie so much.
Date day with the wifey. Did some shopping and saw The Hunger Games. Movie is INTENSE! pic.twitter.com/ueLXXhhvld
Mocking Jay Necklace from The Hunger Games movie just $3.04 with free shipping. Great reviews. http://amzn.to/1czUCcI 
Lol the Hunger Games came on which brought horrifying backflashes to 8th grade when I decided to memorize all the lines of the movie
The movie adaptation of Hungry Hungry Hippos was pretty good but I'm still not sure why they changed the name to The Hunger Games.
Omg I've been loving the hunger games since 7th grade and now I just watched the last movie and now it's like a part of my life is over

man i'm angry that the holiday horror movie krampus is number two in the box office and the hunger games is number one.i call bs on that.
Too bad idk wtf that movie is about since I've never seen any of the hunger games movies lmao
I have real movie-hangover from the Hunger Games
Personally, a prequel seems pointless, because the hunger games series isn't about the games, so a movie of past games, probably Haymitch's-
Only ones here at the movie theater to watch The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2
The new hunger games movie would be way more entertaining if they put the hunger games back into it.
Watch The 100 it's like a combination of the hunger games and that one movie with Will and jaden smith about the abandoned earth

Actually not hating the HUNGER GAMES prequel movie idea. I'd totally pay to see Haymitch's Hunger Games, or even Finnick's and Johanna's.
So my mom asks do you want the hunger games movie or a CD. I legit asked why are you asking definitely a CD without a question

I hate the Hunger Games. Well I don't, but seeing the last movie made remember how much I hated the ending of the book.
I WAS CRYING CONSTANTLY AND REALLY BREATHLESS THE MOVIE WAS SO INTENSE IM SO SAD THE HUNGER GAMES SERIES IS FINALLY OVER
I remember when I thought the hunger games were stupid and now its like my favorite movie series lol

Here's My Review on "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2" (Movie Review) https://youtu.be/3RJIbfNCdsM  via @YouTube #mockingjaypart2
@mytwidds did the Hunger Games in the movie have big billboards for Bridgestone and Coke?
Maddy and I literally screamed,cried and clapped in the hunger games movie pretty sure that's not supposed to happen @MaddyyyRogers
wanna go see the hunger games movie but I have no one to watch it with :/
Saw the Mockingjay finale, seals my opinion of the Hunger Games as the finest book-to-movie adaptations since LOTR. Masterfully done.
//Just finished a movie that was messed up, kind of like the hunger games only not ... Circle.
After seeing the last movie, I can say that if the hunger games franchise has taught me anything, it's that fashion ALWAYS saves the day!!
If you'd rather watch the hunger games movie instead of watching Creed, we can't be friends.
I'm not okay with the Hunger Games series being over, but the last movie was so good!!
Omg I just saw The Hunger Games movie and I am emotional and so happy!!! I'm gonna miss the entire series forever. *buys all movies*
the hunger games was such a gooood movie i love me some josh hutcherson
I just wanna see the hunger games movie that's really all I want.
the hunger games is my life honestly best movie series and book series ever

the hunger games movie was okay, I wish there was more woody harellson, I also wish I was watching kingpin
I cried like a baby. The movie is literally epic. True love prevailed in the Hunger Games.
The Hunger Games series were the best books turned into movies ever. Every movie was absolutely amazing
Watching commercials with Jennifer Lawrence before the movie? "What else is she in?" - mom...uh the hunger games which we are here to watch
That was definitely THE best movie out of the hunger games movies.
the real question is, why was the baby Asian at the end of The Hunger Games movie?
the hunger games movie ended six different times
Miles garret thinks he is in the hunger games movie
It makes sense that in a movie called the hunger games she falls in love with a piece of bread.
The Hunger Games movie felt a lot like a Pinter play... Too many dramatic pauses.
Who is willing to go see the hunger games movie with me....

Went to watch a movie, before having breakfast. The movie was appropriately titled "The Hunger Games".
I feel so left out when everyone talks about the hunger games and the new movie mockingjay bc i've never seen or read the books so like ???
The last movie of the hunger games was such an emotional rollercoaster
I love The Hunger Games series, can't wait till the last movie come out on DVD so I can buy all of them all together

my parents are having a movie date night in our living room and watching all of the hunger games, so that's my Friday night summed up
the hunger games is the first movie Ina long time to actually scare me with a jump scene
I'm indifferent on the hunger games. I thought it was good but Idk if that's just bc it's the final movie and I'm forcing myself closure

The hunger games: Part 2 was really good! Haven't watched a movie & gave my critic opinion so I'm back at it again ha! I'd give it an 8.5/10
the hunger games is seriously one of the best movie series
The hunger games movie has me pissed at the world I'm so mad
Just saw the Hunger Games finale! Loved the movie, but I'm not sure about the ending. I didn't read the books, so I was shocked! Thoughts?
I should've saved my free movie pass to watch Creed instead of wasting it on the Hunger Games tbh
I know I've surrounded myself with good people bc no one wants to see the hunger games movie w me
The hunger games mocking jay part 2 was probably the worst movie I have ever seen IN MY LIFE don't waste 2hrs of your life on this
the hunger games was a gooooood movie
When you try to explain the hunger games to your sister but you get to excited and you ruin the whole movie for her
The Hunger Games is always a good movie to watch!
PSA: don't take @triceratommy to see the hunger games because he will cry the entire movie and make a scene
Props to the hunger games for using a former feral as the cat in the movie. Just noticed the notched ear

The Hunger Games Mocking Jay Part II was disappointing. I'm not at all pleased with how this movie got put together.
@maes_lauren the hunger games is more likely to happen then what was in that movie
On the real did the Hunger Games cast wear Kanye West Yeezus wardrobe for the movie???
