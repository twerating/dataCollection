The Martian movie Director: Ridley Scott http://www.like4you24.com/the-martian-movie/ …
The Martian movie Hints: Genre: Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi http://www.like4you24.com/the-martian-movie/ …
& those who vote for huge hits have Inside Out & The Martian. Not to say a Best Pic nom can't happen, but no movie has a slot to itself. 2/2
The further I get from it the more THE MARTIAN has become the "Oh right... That happened." Movie of the year for me.

I like The Martian a lot, and Damon is very good, but I could see SAG members skipping it because it's not an "actor's movie."

The Martian Movie: The plot features the concatenation of so many extreme improbabilities the story descends into the domain of the silly.
Acknowledging that Interstellar and The Martian are very different, of the two, how did the /Nolan/ movie have more interesting characters?
Underwhelmed by THE MARTIAN. Felt completely full and sterile. Seems like it was cut down from a four hour movie.
@_ClaireLanglois read the Martian. Smart, funny, and thrilling (even if you've seen the movie)
I now have the Martian the movie and the Martian the audiobook but I still don't have the Martian the book. Gonna watch it tonite

"The Martian" is a very good movie, wonder when nollywood with attain that level. Much into research..

Mad Max was a fine, fun movie but I hope it doesn't take over all the critics awards. Beats The Martian though
I saw The Martian today and it was amazing. Even though sitting in an uncomfortable movie theater chair hurts my back terribly.
Dinner and movie date! Finally seeing The Martian with @Neon_Sweetie, can't wait to see how lost she'll get

Part of me wants to go to The Martian now but I don't know if a nerd movie can keep my attention now im amped up on Jock tears!
So, The Martian is the best written + directed movie of the year + contains the best leading male performance but is NOT the best picture?

The Martian movie was great. Nice to see a good Ridley Scott movie after a few crappier ones. Roll on Prometheus 2.
Lithuanian the martian cover is with movie poster why @ god i dont deserve this i am good hardworking person
@GraemeHarwell @DDoherty_ Academy always have a popular movie get a bunch of noms to get more people to watch but it'll be The Martian tho
Yall should see the Martian! Kinda lengthy movie but it was great! But if you're opposed to F-bombs it's not for you....
The Martian looked excellent in 3D! The movie was just as good as I anticipated.
Saw the Martian last night and that movie is as great as advertised. I love everything about it.
Dear NASA, you know how in that movie The Martian the guy gets left on Mars all by himself? I'd like to sign up for that please.
Having just finished The Martian, looking forward to the movie but wondering how many casual references to cannibalism they'll work in
the only part of the movie "the Martian" I enjoyed was when Starman by David Bowie was played
Reading the Martian so I can then watch the movie and complain about how it's not as good as the book
The Martian was an awesome movie but it kinda ruined that oops I did it again video for me.
the martian movie gave me inspiration to do my physics hw for the next 3 hours but not actually do it, just inspiring me to do it
the Martian was such a good movie

We watched The Martian tonight #betterlatethannever It was so good! Probably my favorite movie this year!
Just saw CREED, think it beat "the Martian" and I thought it was the best movie of the year! — watching Creed
The Martian is still my favorite movie of the year so far
Holy Shit The Martian was an amazing movie! Hands Down 10/10
#CREED is FANTASTIC!! Up there with The Martian for movie of the year so far
I can't begin to explain how much of a great movie The Martian is. 100% of people should go see this movie.
The Martian was the best movie I saw this year not titled Selma
So now that I've seen The Martian movie I am now re-reading the book. Didn't you?
Donald Glover is in The Martian. Needless to say it's my new favorite movie
For a movie The Martian was entertaining. However I much prefer the book to the movie. What did you think when you saw it?

Finally saw the Martian movie. Liked it a lot, but for completely different reasons than I liked the book. Crazy.

I'm certain THE MARTIAN is still the same very good movie I saw a couple months ago. This is the problem with awards.

@AndrewMayne "The Martian", because of Weird Things :) and the movie was pretty good too (although no pirate-ninja units).

After watching Hunger Games pt3 tonight I still say the best movie of 2015 so far was The Martian followed by Terminator & Mad Max.
Watched 'The Martian' this afternoon in an entirely empty movie theater. Haven't been to the theater in years. No one goes anymore it seems.
@AStone_79 I haven't seen the Martian, I thought that was just like a sub movie from interstellar Ahahah but since it ain't I wanna see it
I’m aware that I’m late to the party, but: The Martian is a good movie, you guys. Also, @donaldglover. So go watch it if you haven’t yet.

@lorhaun The Martian if you haven't read it yet or seen the movie. Grisham's Sycamore Row was good too.
My favorite part of watching The Martian was when the movie ended, someone in the back of the theater sighed a very audible "Whew!"
The Martian was pretty darn good. I should stop watching movie trailers, I didn't need a trailer to enjoy this movie.

Re-reading The Martian by @andyweirauthor. Such a great read. I haven't watched the movie yet but I hope the screenwriter kept the humor.
. @violet1818 @JewelELeonard Right, I remember @andyweirauthor had a Q&A on Reddit for The Martian before the movie premiered.
Saw Jim James outside the movie theater last night. He said he was going to see the Martian.
Honestly after seeing the movie "The Martian" I've realized it's just "Castaway" in space.

About the movie and book "The Martian." What Mark Watney went through in the movie is nothing compared to what he went through in the book.
Started reading The Martian! It's even better then the movie! And what's even better is that I'm reading it in Matt Damon's voice
okay but Sebastian Stan was so beautiful in the movie the Martian, it brought me tears just looking at him

The Martian was a phenomenal movie
I finally watched The Martian today with my son. WOW! What a smart and thrilling movie. I'm excited for modern Sci-Fi again.
The Martian was a pretty cool movie
i read the martian and it was soooo hilarious and made me cry a bunch of times i'm gonna watch the movie soon i'm so excited
The Martian is suchhhh a good movie
I finally saw the movie The Martian. What an incredible story and amazing filmmaking! Now I want to read the book.
The movie "The Martian" should have been named "The Space Pirate"
the Martian is a movie about how NASA hires a bunch of hot young astronauts and they make America care about science again
Finally saw The Martian. Can't decide whether I like the book or the movie better. Movie was REALLY good.
Was hesitant to watch The Martian. Book was really good. Movie didn't disappoint. #discoisunderrated
The Martian movie is wonderful example of the power of mind set and creative problem solving. 21C skills in deed. #sd42 #newteach42
the martian was a good movie, minus the fact that they TOOK OUT HALF THE BOOK
These old ladies behind me at the movies said that The Martian is a stupid movie how insulting -_-
HOLY SHIT THE MARTIAN IS A GOOD MOVIE.
the martian is my favorite movie and I'm getting the book I am SO happy
The Martian is an *amazing* movie. Much much better than Interstellar for my taste…
a great reason to watch the Martian is because Donald Glover (childish gambino) is in it!!!!! (Plus,it's just a gr8 movie overall)

the martian is an awesome movie, recommend it to anyone, really worth watching
Accidentally butt-tweeted earlier while I was watching The Martian. Sorry about the half-winky-face-thing... That was a great movie, btw.
Just saw The Martian. Weirdly excited that a movie which mentions Zork II and Leather Goddesses of Phobos is a possible Oscar candidate.
Finally saw The Martian. Glad to see Ridley Scott had at least one good movie still in him
I recommend The Martian 100% if anyone is looking to a see a movie soon
Anyway, time to go see The Martian. Feel like I already saw this movie...http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692  (The jokes, I keep them topical)
Everyone needs to go see The Martian. It's playing at Sun Valley Movies and it's $4.50 a ticket. Go. Now. The movie is freaking awesome.

Not only was The Martian an awesome movie, it had an excellent movie soundtrack lol
Finally saw THE MARTIAN. Good job, Ridley Scott! You made your first good movie in like a decade!
He asked me to go watch the Martian movie. I said no. But it's the thought that counts.
Maybe I'm still in the honeymoon phase, but THE MARTIAN was the best movie I've seen in a long time.
If for some reason you have been feeling a little low over the past few days, allow recommend the movie THE MARTIAN as a pick-me-up.
@ltdstn @justkhoai It's from the movie/book. If you've not seen The Martian yet better go before its out of theaters. It's great!
Just saw "The Martian." Excellent film. Good representation of black people. Rare for a movie where we not the focus.
The Martian is such a fantastic movie. 5 stars, would see again.
TIL there are people who don't like Matt Damon and that The Martian is an incredible movie.

I highly recommend the movie The Martian. It's truly beautiful.
@IamFlaurentSoki I would love it if it went to The Martian. A movie about the best of humanity should be celebrated.
The Martian is yet another fantastic space movie omg
THE MOVIE THE MARTIAN IS AMAAAAAZING AND IT HAS CHILDISH GAMBINO IN IT
The Martian movie turned one of the most scientifically accurate sci-fi books into a frustratingly dumbed-down sci-fi movie
Finally got to see "The Martian". Very Interstellar. Drawn out, intriguing, captivating, moving, etc. Solid movie, nothing special. 7.1/10.
That movie was so good!! Go watch the Martian! Shows if you are determined and don't give up you can achieve ANYTHING! 
The Martian might be the greatest movie ever.
The Martian was honestly the best movie I've ever seen.
The Martian was the best movie I've seen in a while, wasn't expecting Donald Glover to be in it either!

Seeing people reading “The Martian” in the airport makes me (a) want to read it again, (b) see the movie again, and (c) ask if they like it.

Woah. The Martian was the best movie I've seen this year. What a roller coaster ride of emotion. Wow. If you haven't seen it: go do it!
I found the martian much better tho as i didn't know what was going to happen& although it was a long movie it kept me on edge throughout it
Saw "The Martian" it was decent but a very long drawn out movie and very predictable. I would give it a 6 or 7 out of 10.

There are like a billion people in India and they couldn't find one Indian to play the role of Vincent Kapoor for the movie The Martian #sad
2 BM in The Martian. 0 BW. Ultimately a very mediocre movie. 2 hours of the planet doting on a white cis man. Same story, different setting.
The Martian was so intense! Such an amazing movie! My brain still hurts from thinking about it all but I love it!
Double feature at the sac drive in. The Peanuts Movie and The Martian. Lmao

The Martian. Did not work for me as a book, but I freakin' loved the movie.

The Martian was really good, imho. Ridley still got it. That feeling of solitude throughout the movie... so good. And the music!
The Martian is the best movie I've ever seen.
"The Martian" is what I call a movie. In many ways it's different from the usual Hollywood rhetorics
BREAKING NEWS: I just FINISHED WATCHING THe MARTIAN and IT IS OFFICIALLY MY@FAVPRITE@MOVIE
The Martian was a much more interesting movie than I thought it would be. Right up there with Inside Out for my favorites of the year.

This "The Martian" movie isn't as lit as I thought...

@bellathorne rent "The Martian" and if you rent "Crimson Peak" (horror movie) tweet your review abt it considering watching it
"Everest" was a pretty good movie. I'll try "The Martian" during the week. Watching those back to back might not be a good idea.
The Martian was a great movie

I was gone for 5 hours because most of that time was spent watching The Martian and that movie was sick as hell
no one got shot at the movie theater and the martian was so good it made a bitch cry!!!
Just saw The Martian. Ridley Scott knows how to make a good space movie. I dunno what happened with Prometheus.
The Martian resonated long after the ending. Illustrated the angst and euphoria of solitude. Perfect metaphor for the single life. #movie

honestly The Martian is the best 10/10 good movie
the Martian is honestly such a stressful movie oh my god I was ready to cry every time something went wrong.
The Martian: 3/5 rating. Supporting cast poor. Background score in movie out of sync. Feels silly at times instead of serious. Book better.
