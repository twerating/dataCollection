obviously, I urge one and all to seek out the old movie The Witchfinder General alias The Conqueror Worm. Great all around.

Watching a Vincent Price movie I haven't preciously seen: WITCHFINDER GENERAL (aka THE CONQUEROR WORM) based on a Poe story. >P<
@TeamRickandIlsa Wow this could be on par with a Charlie Chan movie or maybe even The Conqueror. #TCMParty
2hour movie The Conqueror taking 3 cuz hubs keeps rewinding the truly bad scenes for 2nd look. Movie introduced as "the best of the worst."
Tonight's date: The Conqueror w/John Wayne. This is a 2 bottles of wine movie. At least. So bad. pic.twitter.com/Fa2R5a7kE3
Watching 'The Conqueror' said to be worse movie of the 50's....I like it. What's not to like? John Wayne ( as Mongol) captures Princess.
Wow. The Conqueror really is the silliest movie ever made…Husband expects me to answer ? like, "What the diff between Tartars & Mongols?"
John Wayne as Genghis Khan? How have I never come across this movie? Behold ... THE CONQUEROR! On TCMHD right now! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHt0Pb8rkXU …
Need a horrible movie to laugh at? Watch The Conqueror, with John Wayne as Genghis Kahn w/ Charlie Chan 'stache & Susan Hayward as a Tartar.
Watching 'The Conqueror' ... John Wayne plays Genghis Kahn…very interesting casting throughout the movie
So this movie called The Conqueror just came on, John Wayne is playing Genghis Kahn and Susan Hayward is his love interest. Enough said.
surprised no one's made a movie about the making of THE CONQUEROR, especially since Howard Hughes AND a nuclear testing site were involved
Emily and I are watching a movie called The Conqueror. The premise: John Wayne plays Genghis Khan... complete with his western drawl.
@TheAmitie @mongo_ebooks The Conqueror is an amazingly bad movie and may have actually killed a huge number of its cast and crew
tonight's movie is the infamous "John Wayne as Genghis Khan" flick THE CONQUEROR. And oh lord, it is a T-U-R-K-E-Y
Ok so I really need to do my homework but there's a movie on with John Wayne playing Genghis Khan called the conqueror and I'm entranced.
The Conqueror next? I'm excited! That is some stinky cheese parading as a movie. John Wayne's bare legs! #TCMParty https://twitter.com/rsmon77/status/644688938431479809 …

Wow! That was a helleva movie! Part 2 in store, that means...... Kang the Conqueror!! #Avengers
Next Avengers movie needs some Kang the Conqueror action.
when is Marvel going to give me a movie with Kang the Conqueror, MARVEL PLZ
@The_Black_Amigo it has to be Kang the conqueror to really make the movie worth seeing or baron zemo and a giant supervillain team up
------->Avengers<-------BEST FUCKING MOVIE EVER! An hour line was worth the wait! Extra scenes @ the end, introducing "Khan The Conqueror"
220 workers on movie,The Conqueror, 91 got cancer likely because their location was used for nuclear tests.
So was that thanos or Cain the conqueror at the end of the movie?
Man, if the Justice League movie actually features Starro The Conqueror as the villain, I'll die a happy man.
"The Conqueror was filmed during the Upshot-Knothole nuclear tests... I think I saw that movie once."

Kull The Conqueror. Now *that* was a good movie. :-)
I can hear my brother watching Kull the Conqueror. Which is sad that I can tell it's that movie by the dialogue alone.
Movie time! Watching Kull The Conqueror starring Kevin Sorbo. This should be a blast!
In 1956, John Wayne played Genghis Khan in "The Conqueror." I need to see this movie.
5 things I've learned today: 1. Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shambala is a great movie...
Not only was "The Conqueror" a bad movie, the choice of a lethal location led to the later deaths of cast & crew... »» http://bit.ly/HCbcZx 
The Conqueror of the Orient (1962), First-Time Watch. B-Movie Score - 3.5/5 (DVD)
"Kull the Conqueror" or "Seven"! Movie time!
Watching the Conqueror , I think its a Spanish movie & of course its better than the french one. #ButBoring
Hercules on TV. RT @Obefiend_SRS: Tim Krul looks like Kevin Sorbo. He played Krull the Conqueror in a movie once

Watching Full Metal Alchemist Movie 'The Conqueror of Shamballa'
Loki as the villain in the Avengers movie is interesting. Would have wanted to see Kang the Conqueror as the villain & Vision in the movie
Wait so the Conqueror of Shamballa movie was made because the first anime had an "open" ending... Does that mean Brotherhood is "closed"?!
@MindReels The movie was renamed for the US audience as:The Conqueror Worm.It raised a few eyebrows when it first came out.

I forgot there was a Kull the Conqueror movie. From 1997. With Kevin Sorbo. Can't. Look. Away.
I am mentally casting the movie version of THE CONQUEROR'S SHADOW. This is probably the textbook definition of "getting ahead of yourself."

Playing catch up, just saw Pelle the Conqueror. An amazing movie. I think Max von Sydow's was born old.

@ksorbs Yesterday night... the movie "Kull the Conqueror" was on German TV... really liked it! nice story! I love the background-music! xoxo
Pretty much the most well done anime movie I've seen that isn't a Miyazaki is The Conqueror of Shambala. Even One Piece can't top it. ^^;
KULL THE CONQUEROR: Great movie or GREATEST movie? Discuss. Check your work, cite all sources.
I miss FMA so much!!!! Gah...i gotta watch all of the conqueror of shambala movie again...gawd...i remember why i'm so obsessed...

@charzmendoza Coolness. Tell him there's a movie (The Conqueror of Shamballa) and a 2nd season (FMA:Brotherhood). :D
Is there any movie suckier than The Conqueror with John wayne? Because of this movie, when I think Genghis Kahn, I think of the duke. Awful!
You know what, the re-racing of The Conqueror is so wild and surreal I'm just going to ignore it and judge as, like, a movie.
Ah, Vin Diesel to play Hannibal in 2011 movie "Hannibal The Conqueror" it'll still be great for Black / African American History sake
@gunnihinn also known as "The Conqueror Worm" in europe. hahaha, just had to release some nerd facts. Enjoy that movie. its awesome.
@time_zoned yup it is, an anime movie titled "The Conqueror of Shambala", release some years back after the first FMA series
