The Vow is a terrible movie so far. It's basically: Channing Tatum: remember me Amnesiac Wife: no I'll remember everyone BUT you
An amnesiac, Henry inspired the movie Momento. He always had a book of crosswords nearby, to keep his detective skills sharp.
I keep thinking Dark City was a videogame movie but that's probably because it's about an amnesiac who has special powers saving the world

@Nathanhph I agree! It's a great movie. Research on the true story of the amnesiac who keeps loving his wife. Now that's just great
Sometimes I think I want to be a sexy tattooed amnesiac out for vengeance like that guy in that movie that goes backwards. So romantic!
@narend133 you should watch this movie too then: "Memoirs of Teenage Amnesiac". A bit too drama, but still lots of good quotes. Haha~
Actually "Supremacy Clause" sounds like a movie starring Matt Damon as an amnesiac assassin who become the new Santa Claus.
@Amnesiac_R I need to see that movie like I need a hole in the head.
Movie idea: Lawyer defends an amnesiac who regains their memory during the trial and it turns out they didn't do it after all

moral of the movie: if you exploit a rich amnesiac woman you'll get banged and eventually make her a better person, and also your wife
@ghostfinder Not very. They take the basic idea of the amnesiac spy and go their own way. Still a good movie worth watching.

From my point of view, I suggest you to read "Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac" by Gabrielle Zevin. The movie is... quite different.

Wonder why Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac movie (based on the novel by Gabrielle Zevin) is a Japanese movie.. interesting.
@Amnesiac_R You should definitely check out the movie, "Awakening." It's absolutely awful, and it's a "scary movie:" a change from drama.
