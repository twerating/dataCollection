"I'm gonna make a gut wrenching movie about child soldiers in Africa with a lot of shock value and call it *BEASTS* of No Nation!"
Overall, "Beasts of No Nation" was a shit movie. Just African brutality porn designed to inspire sympathy from white liberals.
beasts of no nation was a hard movie to watch but it was pretty good. great performance from idris elba and abraham attah. wonderful score.

Bugsy Malone by way of Jacopetti & Prosperi, Beasts of No Nation is harrowing stuff, but aesthetically it's very much a modern TV movie.
While watching BEASTS OF NO NATION, I was wishing I liked it more. It's a good movie with greatness in its grasp. http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/child-war-is-hell-in-the-gripping-important-only-slig-1736231282 …
