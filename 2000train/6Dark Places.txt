No, it's not just a movie to me. I grew up with #StarWars. It was an amazing fantasy world that was an escape from dark places for me.

@sweetiemoretz I haven't seen "Dark Places" yet,does she have a big part in that movie?
Dark Places I a good movie, it's not scary but I think it's show how much humans can be desperate and how some of them can lie so easily
Btw, Dark Places is a really good movie. Go watch that.
Tonight's DWA movie "Indigenous" starts at 9PM EST. Are you ready to go to dark places? #ScarySocial
Watching Dark Places. We'll see how this Gillian Flynn movie stacks up to the book.
dark places looks like a good movie
The movie adaptation of Dark Places was sooooooo bad, did the book (which was so good) no justice.. even by itself it was just a bad movie
Sometimes a movie adaptation of a book worth watching. "Dark Places" is not one of those times

listen, as an avid stan for charlize theron I must admit the movie adaption of dark places by gillian flynn is..........not....that.....good
After reading Dark Places I must say the movie was extremely disappointing, star cast full of improbable plot twists that don't make sense
Just don't ever watch the Dark Places movie, it's so horrifically bad it does the book not even a sliver of justice.
It'll be Dark Places by Gillian Flynn. Cuz then I can watch the movie for free.
@kolo515 Dark Places is my favorite and it was turned into a movie but it didnt have very good views
Finally watching the movie adaptation of one of my favorite books, Dark Places. If you haven't read it, put it on your list.

Yo, the movie Dark Places is on demand I have to watch it. The book was so good
So after i read Gone Girl and went amd bought all Gillian Flynn's books and i just found out she has a movie to Dark Places
MUSINGS Dark Places It lacks something from the book but was a pretty good movie. (See my home entertainment blog post coming soon for more)
Its Saturday! how about a movie night? "Dark Places" showing at CinemaCity Citymall Beirut Souks Cinemacity VOX... http://fb.me/3OatvyHBr 
Is the Dark Places movie any good? I don't trust Charlize movies anymore.
This movie is telling me to move to a place with no windows, attics, basements and dark places. #insidious
Delicious stir fry + Dark Places movie + wine + warm cookies = great girls night in compliments of @cddeck
Don't ever watch the movie "Dark Places" with Charlize Theron. Horrible movie, with an even worst ending.
Was excited to watch Dark places the movie, but so far everything is just off.
Ooooooh, there's the new Poltergeist... and Dark Places... I guess tonight I'll do a movie night :3

So the Dark Places movie was good but the book was better because it left more to be revealed right at the very end for a bigger shock.
Charlize Theron looks so good in the movie Dark Places btw

Disappointed with the movie version of Dark Places
Omg they're making it into a movie!?? RT @cultjer: Review: Dark Places leaves a lot to be explored (cont) http://tl.gd/nkql1e 
Movie didn't give justice to Gillian Flynn's "Dark Places". So what if Libby's Charlize Theron and Chloë Moretz is Diondra. Disappointing.
Oh God. Charlize Theron and Christina Hendricks are both in this movie "Dark Places". Ooooooh
Dark places movie with charlize theron fell flat. Good acting but story all over the place. Not a must see !!!
just finished dark places by gillian flynn and i'm watching the movie trailer, nicholas hoult is lyle!!!
Dark Places movie kinda boring to me!
Watched Gillian Flynn's movie adaptation of Dark Places last night and it was good though Charlize would not have been my choice for Libby

Just watched "Dark Places." As often is the case, the movie doesn't do the book justice.
Dark places is such an amazing movie it made me cry
I loved the movie dark places, but I guess it's cause I didn't read the book because everyone is giving it horrible ratings online
Watching the movie adaptation of Dark Places by Gillian Flynn I still can't believe the feminists accused her of misogyny #AppleTV
Gillian Flynn is queen of the curve ball. The Dark Places movie was just as good as the book.
I WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE "DARK PLACES" SO BAD BUT IT'S NOT EVEN PLAYING IN ANY NEARBY THEATERS HELP

"Dark Places" wants to be a movie about forgiveness. My review @CTmagazine: http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/august-web-only/dark-places.html …
Ouch, Dark Places (the movie) is bad. Like lucky-I-watched-Gone-Girl-first-or-I'd-lose-faith-in-a-Gillian-Flynn-adaptation bad.
Dark Places looks like a bad movie that I would enjoy. Essentially the inverse of Gone Girl.
@kellierowe Dark Places was SO good. Gillian Flynn is amazing. I can see how this story wouldn't work for a movie though.

Just finished reading Dark Places. Read it before you see the movie people. Educate yourselves.
Just finished "Dark Places" by Gillian Flynn, author of "Gone Girl". Enjoyed it. I gather it's now a movie starring Charlize Thieron.

Next movie based on Gilian Flynn's novel, Dark Places
Dark Places is a good movie.
It's weird how little they've marketed the Dark Places movie. You'd think they'd want to ride on Gone Girl's success...

Dark Places was a good movie. Not as good as Gone Girl but still a pleasing adaptation of a Gillian Flynn novel. Midwest representer!
THERES GOING TO BE A MOVIE BASED ON THE NOVEL DARK PLACES....I can't wait I can't wait (same author of gone girl)
Dark places is an underrated movie, less than 10 people who watched it in the same cinema as I am. Probably because of Ted 2.
Dark places was awesome. Can't beat gone girl but still it was awesome. That movie is underrated but still good

FUCK YES. DARK PLACES IS GETTING A MOVIE.
The scariest movie trailor is here: @CharlizeAfrica in Dark Places : http://bit.ly/1Revw55  pic.twitter.com/iZmnBnL02I
It's so weird to me that Dark Places (the movie adaptation of Gillian Flynns book) is already out here in Nicaragua
Dark Places is being made into a movie! I cannot wait because the book was phenomenal!
They are making Dark Places into a movie and @ChloeGMoretz is gonna be Diondra YAS
Definitely eager to see the Dark Places movie!!!! Wow, what a cast.
The Dark Places movie. I read the book and it was a lot to take in. Gone Girl seems tame in comparison. Have you read it, @kinksncupcakes?
@DallasDietzenba @boomerknowlton Those are two very effed up books. Dark Places is being made into a movie.
@blharris4 The book is SO good. The movie followed very closely, but it's just SO well written/executed. Dark Places...messed with me.
Wow Dark Places trailer is terrible. Whoever put that together should be fired, but the synopsis of the movie still intrigues me.
Dark Places is going to be a movie... Yes!
I had no idea they made Dark Places into a movie.
Maybe I should start reading Dark Places before the movie comes out. How to squeeze it into my schedule, I have no idea.
so. the dark places movie is a huge pile of garbage
Dark places is going to be a movie I've never been so excited in my life
Dark places movie is coming out and Charlize Theron is in it. YAAAASSS!
@CallMeAmburrr the movie was a pretty good adaptation so I was pretty happy! You should read dark places, the movie is coming out soon!

Dark Places. Brilliant book. Loaded with suspense. It doesn't get better than this. #DarkPlaces Wait for the movie begins. @CharlizeAfrica
Sad to hear there's no "Dark Places" U.S. release date yet, that's a movie I want to see! Trailer sounded awesome! #BookNerd

Very excited about the Dark Places movie adaption.
I hope they make a movie out of Gillian Flynn's Dark Places like they did Gone Girl. I can't put it down. #nowreading
@nickmeece I really enjoyed the book. I also liked Gillian Flynn's Dark Places which will soon be a movie too.
Dark places is being turned into a movie ... I'm almost done with the book .. It's creepy but dope

Doing some mental recasting for the Dark Places movie. I think Kate Mara would have made an amazing Libby, tbh.
@ccorrinaa Sharp Objects (next movie) and Dark Places. They are just as good.
Self discovery can lead to some dark places. My real favorite movie is The Mask?!
Wait, Dark Places has been turned into a movie? Huh. The cast are not what I pictured at all.
I'm SO excited they're making Dark Places into a movie! The book was AWESOME haha I'm so excited
And Gillian flynn's 'sharp objects' is becoming a TV show and 'Dark places' is going to be a movie! I'm so pumped!

Can anyone please tell me when Dark Places will be screened here in Malaysia? Pleaseeeeeeeeeee I'm anticipating this movie so much

Finally finished Dark Places!!! Only took three nights highly recommend checking it out and super excited for the movie!!!

“Sharp objects” was so much better than “Dark Places”. Wish they'd make a movie out of that one instead. Amma is a true psychopath.

Oh snap. Dark Places is being made into a movie? But who is Charlize playing? She's too old to play the main character. Maybe the mom.
dark places was such a shit book anyways (might make a better movie if it was done well tho) but it's gonna flop

@shanerzz I wanna read "Dark Places" before that becomes a movie. That book caused less outrage.
Time to get home and watch a movie before my mind wanders to dark places
The movie goes into some really rich dark places in the 3rd act with everyone at their lowest with ironic twists of fate. Then, happy. Hmm.
I'd like to apologize to @BryanlMarquis for cussing through the entirety of Dumb & Dumber To. That movie took me to some dark places.
Dark Places will be a movie! Wooohoooo!!
@AshleyRayMusic both twisted! Sharp Objects shorter. Dark Places will be a movie next year with Charlize Theron
I don't even want to know how someone comes up with a book like dark places but I def won't be going to see that movie
I loved both the book & movie Gone Girl but after just finishing Dark Places I regret wanting to read other books by Gillian Flynn

@Stayshift @Mpr53188 I love that movie...in a very real way. It's got me out of very dark places after breakups.
Regarding "Dark Places" as a movie, is Gilles Paquet Brenner serious about bringing Ted Bundy, Manson, the Black Dahlia to the story?

Gillian Flynn needs to write faster. Cannot consume enough of her books. Highly anticipating Dark Places movie

I just found out that Dark Places has been made into a movie staring Charlize Theron.

@Mayaaloha still a good movie!! I bought her other 2 books. You should read dark places and sharp objects.

@notken If you have time, I recommend Dark Places from the same author Gillian Flynn. It's going to be a movie also next year with ...
@pinkypoinker @crazyjane13 Loved Gone Girl! I hear the movie is awesome. Also read Dark Places, another top read by Gillian Flynn.
#GoneGirl #gillianflynn presently in the middle of Dark Places. Saw GG movie last night. Do all her books have twisty endings?
#GoneGirl was one of those books I couldn't put down. The movie was just as good. Rereading Dark Places. Waiting for the movie!
Hear #GoneGirl writer GillianFlynn has another book-to-movie for us: Dark Places, her 2nd novel, stars #CharlizeTheron + #ChristinaHendricks
@ninanesbitt Dark Places will also be a movie in 2015 with Charlize Theron, Chloe Moretz, .. And yep I would hesitate marry Gillian Flynn ;)
@Mm_Howell @Mr__JT Dark Places movie comes next year!! I gotta charge my kindle so I can finish it
After Gone Girl, Dark Places is going to be a MOVIE
Is the Dark Places movie ever gonna be released??
@foreignlolly I'm a little wary of the Dark Places movie, but I adored the book. It was the first of hers I'd read.
Sharp Objects is going to be turned into a TV Series and Dark Places is bound to hit movie theaters sometime next year. What is this life?
We love books as much as we love movies Dark Places by @gillianflynn Here is a trailer movie base on this book. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vWfJa1dfl8 …
@NicholasHoult had a blast filming DARK PLACES with you last year, any idea when the movie is coming out ??
@gillianflynn @VanityFair I read Dark Places I WANT THE MOVIE !!
if u liked #GoneGirl try reading dark places. It's sick, creepy and weird and I loved it! Ps it will also be a movie soon! #gillianflynn
Attention Attention: They are making Dark Places (another book by Gillian Flynn who wrote Gone Girl) into a movie. #SoHyped
Charlize Theron is playing Libby in the ‘Dark Places’ movie. Christina Hendricks is her mother. Hmmmmmmmmmmm.
@CNHarder @VanityFair And here I was thinking Dark Places would be her best movie, a classic “whodunit"
The movie adaptation of Gone Girl was amazing. I really hope they do Dark Places next. I loved reading it. I also need to get Sharp Objects.
@LauralizHibbard Yeah there's a "Dark Places" movie coming out next year with Charlize Theron and my nemesis.
The movie Gone Girl left me amazed and shocked. I'm so glad I was able to watch it on big screen. Now I'm excited for Dark Places!
Finished reading Dark Places, just found out Nic Hoult is gonna be in the movie I THINK IM GONNA PEE MY PANTS
isn't dark places being made into a movie too? that's my favorite book of hers
Everyone said Annabelle was a terrible movie.. But here I am... Staring at walls.. And dark places.. And wanting to keep all the lights on
Are they making a movie from Gillian Flynn's "Dark Places" as well? Because they should. Did I ask this already? It's so good.
Filth is an amazing movie. It's goes to all the dark places and back. Really fucking solid
@PMH360 Its pretty good. I liked Sharp Objects more, but they are making a movie of Dark Places next I think.
Forget #GoneGirl. Gillian Flynn's best book is Dark Places (and they're making it into a movie). http://bit.ly/ZkvoMZ
