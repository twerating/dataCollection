Them: duhhh A Christmas Carol is the best Christmas movie Me: no it's actually Die Hard or Gremlins Them: *boneless flopping on the floor*
my Christmas movie tradition comes down to two movies A Christmas Carol with George C Scott and Scrooged @BenningtonShow
Still my favourite Christmas TV classic. It's a tradition that I re-watch every year. In black and white, natch:) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lRrlurEKg1w …
#tcmparty I know this is a movie crowd, but if you've never read A Christmas Carol, do yourself a favor and spend the couple of hours.
@markhoppus isn't a Christmas carol a Christmas movie?
If Die Hard is a Christmas movie simply because it takes place during Christmas then by definition so would A Christmas Carol.
Anyone ever seen A Christmas Carol? That movie's creepy. Especially when you figure out that dude at the end is the grim reaper.
A Christmas carol just might be my favorite Christmas movie ever

They should make a film where Carol Burnett plays a miserly old movie star who discovers true holiday spirit and call it A Christmas Carol.
@braak categorically, all versions of A Christmas Carol are *more Christmas* than any other kind of movie
@MikeDrucker I've often wondered if republicans see a Christmas carol as a cautionary tale or a horror movie with socialist monsters

@GregGerschenson i love this song and this video! ps. bill murray and miley cyrus just did a christmas carol duet. this movie is now iconic.
I wonder if others are as militant about their favorite movie adaptation of A Christmas Carol. Though the 1938 version is clearly superior.
Disney's A Christmas Carol has to be the creepiest Christmas and kids movie ever.
#Krampus is the 21st century "A Christmas Carol." It's been too long since we had a movie like this. Equally great horror/comedy/Xmas flick!
