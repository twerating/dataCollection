@JasonFattorusso @mrjafri @ClaireLanay favorite obscure movie? I'm going with Zombie Nightmare. Because Adam West and Tia Carrere
@aldwinning Devil's Rejects was the only RZ movie I liked. I'd say it's a classic actually. Worst? Zombie Nightmare is up there. Horrific.

I had another zombie nightmare, this was one that scared the shit out of me but would look great in a movie.
Zombie Nightmare (1986) is a gem. Definitely not your average "zombie apocalypse" movie. Truly unique and heartfelt. give it a watch!
Rifftrax did my parent's movie as their latest: http://www.rifftrax.com/rock-n-roll-nightmare …. Also recommend MST3K's Zombie Nightmare. https://twitter.com/itsanooray/status/607258308525760512 …
I have to say Zombie Nightmare the movie has a great soundtrack

@gratepool Oh yes I saw it and loved it & it reminded me of the British Movie where the guy wakes up in the Hospital to a Zombie nightmare.
I didn't even watch a zombie movie... Why did I just have a zombie nightmare?
Watching MST3K's Zombie Nightmare in honor of the Halloween season. Yikes, this is a particularly putrid movie.
Ugh, zombie nightmare woke me up. It was a full-on movie but kept playing Jefferson Airplane during the fight/attack scenes.

After a long time, had a zombie nightmare, which seemed so much like a movie. Probably set in the 80s.
Who would think that a movie called Zombie Nightmare would live up to its non-plural name? Only ONE zombie. #MST3K

Watching ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE. Not only do I get Adam West, but the director of NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM plays one of the punks in this movie.
This time the small band of survivors in my apocalyptic zombie nightmare were a film crew from a zombie movie. Have they done that yet? #©
Never seen a zombie movie or show, but last night I had one heck of a scary zombie nightmare #norepeats please
Zombie movie marathon this weekend - kicking off with "Zombie Nightmare" starring Adam West and Tia Carrere (MST3K version)
Tia Carrere's best movie is obviously Wayne's World, but Zombie Nightmare is a close second.
Movie of the Now- Zombie Nightmare (mid-80s) A somber reminder that the 80s are over and why we should be thankful.
Zombie Nightmare...the first murder victim was treading H2O when he was supposed to be doing dead man's float. Bad editing. Bad movie.
Watching MST3K: Zombie Nightmare on Netflix. This movie is horrible on so many levels. Hence it is a MST3K classic
@zombiefreak ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE (1986) is the other Thor movie I was thinking of. Fasano acts in it & was Assistant Director.
Word. RT: @74000Riffs: Overdrawn at the Memory Bank is a terrible movie. So terrible its awesome. MST3K week. Zombie Nightmare is on now.

Zombie Nightmare is a really bad movie.
I just found out a local movie theater is playing the MST3K version of Zombie Nightmare in July too awesome for words
So I wanted to watch a really great horror movie tonight. I finally settled on the MST3k version of Zombie Nightmare. Woo.

Watching "Zombie Nightmare" MST3K. I wonder if they originally made that movie to be made fun of one day.
So my daughter and her husband have chosen the next movie....Zombie Nightmare..starring Adam West....I'm sure it will be cheeeeezeeey!
Watching a MST3K movie: Zombie Nightmare. Horrible, kinda like the movie @texasnate is watching right now...
That was my first zombie nightmare since '05, though. Our dorm floor had a couple zombie movie marathons at WSU in '05. Scary stuff.
Watching the MST3K movie this morning (HBO/DVR magic) got me all revved up for the next MST release, Vol. XV. Out 7/7. Go Zombie Nightmare!
@Autumn_Rose07 No, Adam West was in a movie called Zombie Nightmare.
