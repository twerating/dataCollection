@carrieunderwood my favorite christmas movie is deck the halls. So funny
tbh Deck the Halls is a pretty ok movie. Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick, Fred Armisen, Maeby Funke.. can't beat that lineup in a xmas movie
tonight's Christmas movie of choice, and probably the last movie I will see before the world ends, is Deck the Halls starring Danny DeVito.
I know Ann Heche is in Wacko World half the time, but see looks good in this Hallmark movie. Deck the Halls with MILF!
