Last time I saw a movie audience clap and cheer after a movie was "Saving Private Ryan."
Strange that many are saying Bridge of Spies is Spielberg's best movie since Saving Private Ryan. Did they see Catch Me if You Can?
But anyway the movie started with a weird prologue in the present day (kind of Saving Private Ryan-ish) followed by a ridiculous gunfight.
Castaway + Apollo 13 + Saving Private Ryan = a really good movie (The Martian)
All I want is a super hero movie or TV show with the same direction and dark/somber context of like a Saving Private Ryan or Argo

"What's that movie again?" "Uhhhhhh, Saving Private Ryan?" "No.... The Purge..."
16. Favorite movie(s)? -- Random Order Good Will Hunting Saving Private Ryan The Warrior Immortals Hercules Aladdin Lion King.
Tom Hanks and Spielberg have a new movie coming out, ppl acting like these men didn't change everything with Saving Private Ryan smh
@adamrutherford @francinefilm I do hope you'll be discussing that new movie… whatsitcalled?… Saving Private Ryan on Mars
So i just watched American Sniper today. Pretty good movie! Nothing beats Saving Private Ryan though.
Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan, The Social Network Movie and more top @EW list of great movies. #watchlist http://ow.ly/TjNuE 
I want to watching saving private Ryan like right now but it's not on Netflix @netflix @Netflixhelps @Netflix_CA PLEASE ADD THIS MOVIE
Now watching Saving Private Ryan. Love this movie so much. @BarryPepper as Private jackson the sniper. pic.twitter.com/EhYnWHd51C
@Zoe_Beckford "save" him. It says basically "Saving Private Kondogbia", I guess you know the movie "Saving Private Ryan"
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/wgHRj2-vvs8?a  Saving Private Ryan (5/7) Movie CLIP - Private Jackson (1998) HD
saving private ryan is the best movie hands down
Time for a movie classic: Saving Private Ryan!
From saving private ryan to interstellar, the movie entertainment industry learned that leaving mat damon stranded is always a good idea.
saving private ryan is a greatt movie
Hebrew translation for @MartianMovie is "Saving Mark Watney". I think every Matt Damon movie since Saving Private Ryan is named this way.
"Saving Private Ryan" ... Apparently some kind of "Saving Matt Damon" themed movie week.
I've seen the first 25 minutes of Saving Private Ryan four times, but I've never seen the entire movie.
#funfactfriday the movie Saving Private Ryan debuted 17 years ago! Hope that doesn't make you feel too old. pic.twitter.com/MMzwFVz0ga
War movie marathon tomorrow. Any suggestions? Hamburger Hill is on the list. Platoon: seen too many times. As well as Saving Private Ryan.

Watching Saving Private Ryan aka my favorite movie I'm sO EXCITED I'M GONNA DIE
I swear every movie Matt Damon is in is about bringing him back. The Martian, elysium, saving private Ryan, interstellar...
Saving Private Ryan is honestly my favorite movie of all time!
Lone Survivor is one my favorite war movie, right underneath Saving Private Ryan
#download_free_songs saving private ryan movie mp3 http://yourfreesongs.info/pJk 
Saving Private Ryan is my all time favorite movie and I never noticed that Bryan Cranston is in it
Saving Private Ryan may possibly be the best movie ever made
MOVIE REVIEW: The love child of 'Apollo 13' and 'Saving Private Ryan' is....'The Martian'. Highlight is the Bowie song.
The only good thing about basic was watching saving private Ryan and meeting lt Dan from the movie Forrest Gump
@HeatBoner @BiscayneBae the aftermath of that would make the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan look like a kids movie.
Favorite Tom Hanks movie: Saving Private Ryan. Best Tom Hanks performance: Philadelphia. He is AMAZING in Philadelphia. Classic.
The last hour of Saving Private Ryan gets me, what a movie
Interstellar, The Martian, Saving Private Ryan, what is it with Americans spending millions of dollars to make a movie of finding Matt Damon
Was going to watch 'Saving Private Ryan', but then I remembered how much toxic masculinity is on display in that movie. Ditto 'Gladiator'.
From Saving Private Ryan to Interstellar Movie to The Martian, America has spent a ridiculous amount of money trying to retrieve Matt Damon.
Wonder what the next movie Matt Damon will need to be rescued in will be? Saving Private Ryan Interstellar The Martian ???
Saving Private Ryan is such a great movie
I'm alone in thinking "Saving Private Ryan" is not a good movie, right?
@neiltyson @nathorne @MartianMovie Between Saving Private Ryan and this movie, we've spent billions rescuing Matt Damon...
The US seems to have spent a lot of money saving @mattdamon. With Saving private Ryan, Bourne series & now the Martian. Awesome movie.
Besides Bourne, I havent seen a movie with matt damon in it where he is not being saved (e.g saving private ryan, interstellar, martian)

@d1DuM1SSm3 @wannabeJarhead @sawmilltaters @KCarslin @DemonTwoSix @_Dakotastorm you know....the movie. Saving Private Ryan.
I don't know how, but @JKru92 has slept through the entire movie of Saving Private Ryan. Like 3 hours of loud machine guns and screaming
The opening scene of the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is loosely based on games of dodgeball Chuck Norris played in second grade.
In movie plots Matt Damon is forever getting rescued. Saving Private Ryan, Good Will Hunting, even t http://pinterest.com/pin/318137161155763538/ …

I'm a fan of the "Rescue Matt Damon" movie genre: Saving Private Ryan, Interstellar, and The Martian. #fb
People, go see #TheMartian. It's the BEST "Rescuing Matt Damon Movie" since Saving Private Ryan.
With semi-action movie in midway bw Cast Away and Saving Private Ryan an antagonist's needed. Mars isn't bad enough https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/650185679213842432 …
@Rudderbutt why is every movie about saving Matt Damon in some way The Martian, Interstellar, Saving Private Ryan, Good Will Hunting
I was wondering. Which is the best rescuing Matt Damon movie? Saving Private Ryan or The Martian? Back to you!
@arontoad99 why watch this movie about saving Matt Damon when you can watch Saving Private Ryan/Interstellar, both also about saving Damon?
saving private ryan is an all time classic i love this movie
American sniper is a really good movie but if you think it's better than saving private Ryan your fucking nuts
I want to watch the movie about saving Private Ryan in Mars.
saving private Ryan is such a hard movie to watch
