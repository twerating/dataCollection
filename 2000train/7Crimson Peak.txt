Honestly, I give "Crimson Peak" a D+ rating. Horribly disappointed with this movie.
Crimson Peak was a total letdown for me. The trailers made it seem better than it actually was. There is more to a movie than pretty visuals

I lived the owning of the movie, but once she moved to Crimson Peak, it was all very much by the numbers Gothic horror...
Normally when I disagree with Chris Stuckmann it's on a movie he loves and I don't. With Crimson Peak it's kind of the opposite.
I adore Crimson Peak so much. Everything about it. Seeing it again I focused on the movie's aesthetic and it was even more gorgeous.

Crimson peak wasn't just an ordinary horror/thriller movie. It was art. It was beautiful.
"Crimson Peak" is the best movie of the 1920s. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is the best film of the 1980s.
Crimson Peak isnt even playing anywhere in binghamton I havent been waiting for this movie for over a year nope wasnt even excited

Crimson Peak wasn't that good of a movie but the film score is incredible and I can't stop listening to it
Crimson peak was an incredible movie
That moment when you want to buy tickets for Crimson Peak four hours before the movie but they are all sold out.
Crimson peak was easily the best movie I've seen this year. so good
Bout to go do this Crimson peak movie with Oomf
I was a fan of Mia Wasikowska for Stoker and Crimson Peak but keep forgetting she was the star of a movie that grossed a BILLION dollars.
Took the day off. Went to see Crimson Peak (which is LUSH). Had movie popcorn and Diet Coke for breakfast. I am winning at life.
My favourite movie up until last year was Pans Labyrinth. Then I saw The Babadook and loved it. Now @RealGDT is back on top - Crimson Peak

Saw Crimson Peak last night. A bit predictable and the ghosts didn't work for me, but not a bad movie.
Crimson Peak biggest flop this year, doing terrible at the box office and the movie just sucks in general, I don't recommend it

Movie review - Crimson Peak http://www.northernstar.com.au/news/odd-beauty-in-red/2814827/ …
I SAW CRIMSON PEAK'S POSTER AND I NEED THE MOVIE NOW OK
@TyleKurner @loudmouthjulia Yeah. STOKER was 2013, MAPS premiered in 2014, CRIMSON PEAK 2015. Three consecutive incest-movie years, bravo.
@thehexfiles we need to dish about Crimson Peak asap! It was a movie that I saw.
if you plan on watching crimson peak, it's NOT a horror movie; it's a gothic romance story that's really pretty. I was pleasantly surprised.
Crimson Peak was the worst movie I saw in 2015 hands down
I feel bad for all the people I sold tickets to telling them Crimson Peak was a scary movie.
Went to see Crimson Peak, phenomenal movie! And omg Tom Hiddleston...no wonder he's my favourite actor! Love him so much!
"Crimson Peak" is just the girliest monster movie ever and I like it so much for that.
Jessica Chastain saves Crimson Peak but the overall movie I... I'm so disappointed

This Crimson peak movie a little good
just got home from watching Crimson Peak. It was an okay movie, the story was interesting but predictable and so were the jumpscares...
We are getting the movie Crimson Peak this Friday. #gemtheatre #CrimsonPeak
Crimson Peak is a shitty love story, not a ghost story. I didn't even finish the movie. I want my $8 back.
@twhiddleston @jes_chastain @RealGDT Hi Guys ! Just saw Crimson Peak again this afternoon. Such a wonderful movie! Thanks so much ! Tami
Stunning visuals, a gorgeous cast and score- Crimson Peak finally satisfies the hunger for a new original movie. Del Toro never fails.
I quite enjoyed CRIMSON PEAK. It's a gorgeous movie and I really liked the design of the ghosts.

I saw Crimson Peak yesterday. I was naive enough to think that Guillermo del Toro could direct a Tim Burton kinda movie.
I looked through the Art of Crimson Peak book and I NEED IT it is as beautiful as the movie I want it for Christmas
Halloween Movie #1 this year was Crimson Peak. Old school gothic romance rather than horror. Gorgeous visuals. Good cast. Pretty good story.
I forgot to say this but I saw Crimson Peak last night and it was a really great movie! I loved it!

When you get to the 18 minute mark of @insanityreport's crimson peak review...shit gets too real. He legit got mad at this movie lmao
Just saw Crimson Peak. A pleasant murder romp. Poor Ol' Jim Beaver is running up on Sean Bean's movie-to-death ratio.
Crimson Peak was a dope movie
I just gotta say I loved Crimson Peak and it's simply a visual masterpiece. I wanna live in that movie.
Saw a trailer for a Christmas horror movie with Crimson Peak. I think if I want a holiday horror movie, I'm going to stick with Gremlins.

It speaks volumes for Crimson Peak that even though I'm not in a movie mood, I had fun. Also, horror is the best genre.

The most disappointing thing about Crimson Peak was that I had a way better movie in my head when I first saw the trailer.
I think Crimson Peak will disappoint those looking for an intense horror movie. Its really more of a story that happens to have ghosts in it
Last time I saw a movie with my buddy Rob, we drank after. Doing the same thing after Crimson Peak and I gotta say this is a good pattern
Crimson Peak was... I don't even know but I loved it, best movie of the year so far!
Crimson peak was such a good movie I'd watch it again.
Crimson Peak was probably the dumbest movie I've ever seen. So disappointed.
Crimson Peak was a good movie but I am done with ghost and murders and all that other stuff. No more. I'm gonna have nightmares for days...
Crimson Peak and Frozen are the same movie.
Crimson Peak felt like a list of my favourite tropes and plot devices condensed into one movie. Ghosts? Check. Tom Hiddleston's bum? Check.

I can't sleep and I don't know why. Crimson peak was a good ass movie though. I know that shit. Twas popping the fuck off.
Crimson Peak is a REALLY good movie
not sure if I hate: Crimson Peak, main character says "the ghosts are a metaphor" about her novel & the ghosts are a metaphor in the movie
@DrPuppykicker "Is CRIMSON PEAK a horror movie" is gonna replace "is X a sandwich" real soon now
#18: Crimson Peak (2015). The ENTIRE movie is eye candy! Only wish it was a bit grittier/scarier at times. 8 out of 10 sips of poisoned tea.
Crimson peak is one of those movie I can't wait to own on dvd
ok but crimson peak is probably my favourite movie rn oh my god
Great Movie date with Morgs Crimson Peak was pretty good. @justMorgan_15
Crimson peak is a gothic romance not a horror movie tbh
the crimson peak movie was sooo good I can't stop thinking about it

@natvana We went to see Crimson Peak, but literally EVERY OTHER MOVIE was sold out
Crimson Peak was a really good movie
...and with Crimson Peak, I'm almost caught up on #31nightsofhorror!! Guys, I reeeeeeaaaaally liked that movie.
Crimson Peak was such a beautifully written horror movie.
Someone could tell me what is the definition or metaphor of the color red, red ring and other red color thing in the Crimson Peak's movie?.
Crimson Peak was really enjoyable, and I recommend it if the idea of a gothic horror romance(ish) movie appeals to you.
Tbh I can see why Universal resorted to marketing Crimson Peak as a horror movie
Crimson peak was an amazing movie
Omg we're gonna go see crimson peak and it's my first scary movie in the theaters I'm gonna vomit
I apologize to everyone in the same theater as @Sarahgalle8 and I as we laughed and talked through Crimson Peak tonight. Terrible movie.
That awkward moment when Crimson Peak starts in Buffalo and everyone in the theater "what's going on? No movie is filmed in Buffalo?"
Just seen the movie Crimson Peak and it's great yall!! Go watch it
@rachaelking70 Have you seen CRIMSON PEAK? Rebecca and I went earlier. It struck me as the most Rachael King-ish movie ever made.

crimson peak is actually a good film!! go into it w the right mindset tho. it's more of a revenge story than a scary movie.
i must see the movie crimson peak
Crimson Peak was a pretty cool movie, would recommend
Crimson Peak was more gross than scary. Lowkey creepy, but idk why Stephen King apparently said it was the scariest movie ever.
After Crimson Peak, I might as well never go see a movie again.
Saw Crimson Peak today definitely recommend it. @RealGDT really knows how to make a gorgeous movie.
CRIMSON PEAK is really really good. It's a horror movie, IF you are scared of what it turns out to be about.
Crimson Peak was a really good movie btw
crimson peak felt more like dark shadows than that misbegotton tim burton movie did
Crimson Peak was the first time I empathized so profoundly with a movie protagonist that I felt like I became them at some points
Crimson Peak wasn't really a horror movie but you get to see Tom Hiddleston's ass so it was worth it

Omg Crimson Peak is the best movie I've seen all year. The acting is incredible! I recommend it to anyone.
Someone behind me kept screaming during Crimson Peak. Like, if this (tame) movie is too much for you, maybe you should wait for Netflix.
Gabbi the real one for curling up with me during Crimson Peak. Movie was scary ad

Any of you seen #BridgeOfSpies ??? I am thinking of going to a movie to get out of the house. Too scared to watch Crimson Peak alone lol
Does anyone know of any free movie websites I could watch Crimson peak on?
I keep wanting to call that Crimson Peak movie 'Crimson Tide' and I'm not even an Alabama fan #sports
Damn. Crimson Peak was an incredible movie. As if I needed another reason to love Tom Hiddleston.

Photoset: maryxglz: You are so different… - Crimson Peak … this movie. http://tmblr.co/Zisdaw1wo5eME 
Crimson Peak was the worst movie I've seen in a while. A little more plot and a lot more Tom Hiddleston and I would maybe recommend it.
Going to see CRIMSON PEAK, so relax. I'm about to settle the "is it a horror movie" debate with my own perfect opinion soon.
Seeing a movie. Been a long since I was in a movie theater. (at @Cinemark Tinseltown USA for Crimson Peak) https://www.swarmapp.com/c/0WTv6M65n8z 
Crimson Peak is a must see movie for the season. Horror meets substance, along with magnificent set design and wonderful cinematography.

Debating what movie should i watch later hm crimson peak or the walk or or or goosebumps idk
I wanted to go to the movie but both Pan and the Last Witch Hunter look extrememly lame :/ And I am saving Crimson Peak for Halloween...
Surprisingly really liked Crimson Peak. If you go into it realizing it's a gothic romance & not a horror movie, you're more likely to too.
So I liked Crimson Peak obviously, but one thing about it really bothers me: the stereotypical horror movie logic. Sharpe just walks right-
@gameofmaximoffs thank you!! Crimson Peak was definitely a glorious experience of a movie.
Whatever you do don't go see Crimson peak... It's the dumbest movie I've ever seen

Have you ever watched a movie so bad that you couldn't wait to tell others how bad it was? Crimson Peak is that bad. Holy shit! It was bad!
Crimson Peak was actually a pretty good movie
Just got back from Crimson Peak. Holy Hell, I cried. It's not so much a horror movie as a bloody, incestuous and heartbreaking tragedy.
Ugh! Why can't @RealGDT make every movie ever?! Crimson Peak was beautiful!
Saw Crimson peak tonight. It started at 8:30.I fell asleep during the movie bc boring & woke up for the last two minutes. it ended at 10:30

Dear Crimson Peak trailer, you've shown up before every movie I've seen the last few months. I've lost all interest. Thanks anyway.
That movie sound like it should be the name 4 when girls have the worst day on their period RT @TroyLadmirault: I gotta go see Crimson Peak
we saw Crimson Peak, and there was a trailer for Krampus-- which I guarantee was pitched as 'National Lampoon's Christmas horror movie'

Crimson Peak was such a creepy and gore filled movie! but since it was a Gothic Romance, it was a given I loved it.
