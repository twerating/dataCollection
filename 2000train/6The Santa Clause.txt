@MalBrotherton because the Santa Clause 2 is an awful movie
Remember the movie the Santa Clause when Tim Allen gets to the north pole & the elves couldn't care less that the other guy is dead? #Dark
I'm sad that the Santa Clause 3 is a movie. Some duos were never meant to be trios. Might as well make a 4th. Charlie as Santa @MiketheLCB
The Santa Clause is my favorite Christmas movie. I could literally watch it 20 times a year pic.twitter.com/vKPfrSBluk

The Santa Clause is my favorite Christmas movie .. Polar Express is close behind
The Santa Clause is basically just a werewolf movie.
I'm such a sucker for the movie The Santa Clause. SB can't stand it though. The little kid's voice drives him crazy.
The real tragedy of the Tim Allen movie "The Santa Clause" is that far too many people in TV spell "Santa Claus" with the extra "e".
