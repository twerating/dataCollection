That moment when you're watching "Pan" and "Smells like Teen spirit" by Nirvana starts playing in the movie... Awestruck @Q_Jaaku
WHY are they singing nirvana lyrics in the new pan movie I'm confused
I remind myself as one of the lost boys from never land in a Peter Pan movie???? or an elf boy snapchat: heyimbee pic.twitter.com/m0YTr7bdJg
I may be biased because Peter Pan is the best fictional character and idol ever but.... PAN is the greatest movie I've ever seen #Yadadamean

The movie PAN for me is boring. Too slow, and the ending was like dam fast.
Pan has leaked. i shouldn't watch it, i'm tempted to see how bad it is but i draw the line at one Rooney Mara movie per year
I hate how the Pan movie created their own concept of Peter Pan and the Neverland and the pirates and the lost boys and wendy and everything

we just finished shooting a movie i wrote!! it's gonna be amazing. we had a crane shot, all these sweet close-ups, this awesome pan shot

when are they doing that yearly live action peter pan movie again
My my my..have we all forgot about PAN THE MOVIE...stop complaining people..
Usually i hate new songs in classic musicals (cough cough Peter Pan last year cough cough Les Mis movie).... but I'm feeling this.
in jan they'll be doing grease live /i've never seen that movie so /might enjoy more /didn't like peter pan live
Im rly not down wit nba fans chanting 7nation army corny af fam. Reminds me of da chanty scenes in dat latest pan movie lmao smdh
@kevvyko And yeah, I've never understood that live-action Peter Pan musical. The Disney movie is livelier and has better songs.
I'm gonna eat an entire pan of French fries by myself and watch the 5sos movie bye
This is SO MUCH BETTER than Sound of Music and Peter Pan! I don't even like #TheWiz movie...
@notjessewalker If "Peter Pan" & "Sound Of Music" are any indication, it could be so bad it's good, like an old Ed Wood movie.
I kind of have The Wiz fatigue. Is this thing going to look like the movie or like how they did Peter Pan?
pic.twitter.com/AsIEmYXpF7 This Peter Pan origin movie is worth seeing for its amazing special effects 3* http://ow.ly/VhkEl 
@actordougjones @Marvel @SpectralMotion *Pan's Labyrinth gets my vote as best movie of 21st century. Thank you for all of your work.
Not one person of color complained that the sound of music was an all white cast (movie & play), or that peter pan was all white.
Whoever at Warner Brothers approved the movie "Pan" needs to be put in the trash.
Was there any outrage about 'The Sound of Music' or 'Peter Pan' as there is about 'The Wiz', which was a legit movie in the 70s?

The first line of that Geico Peter Pan ad is a perfect showcase of everyone's reaction to the movie, from what I've seen: "Oh..."
So, Sunday Dec. 13 against Wyoming is Star Wars Night at the Pan Am. Nice! Did you know the word ewok is never used in the movie?
@BadRobot173 @MD_Junkie I understand you! But I just believe in them! "I believe, I believe" like in Peter Pan's movie.
@CollinOloughlin happy birthday Collin!! we should go see Pan the movie. October 9th!! turn up
I NEED TO SEE THAT PETER PAN MOVIE SOON!
"Pan". The movie named after what critics did to it.
I think @ElPascoTexas said it himself... if America was a movie, reviewers would pan it for being too unrealistic.
This Krampus movie looks like a Christmas version of Pan's Labyrinth for white people
Pan's Labyrinth is a sick ass movie

I'm so obsessed with this movie. Peter Pan, Hook, Tiger Lily, I love them all! ♡
Late night studying, while watching my favorite all time disney movie "Peter Pan."
With Pan, it was one of those times I felt bad FOR the movie. Like a kid messing up a little league game or school pageant or something.
"To die would be an awfully big adventure" - Peter Pan from that one Peter Pan movie from when I was 8.
Okay Pan was super funny and an amazing movie and if you haven't seen it yet you should probably go see it.
mr perez said i look like Tigerlily from the movie Pan
Lmao just came back from watching Pan, that movie is cute.
@jermainedesign We have to at least see the movie, in order to see how the dynamics pan out, entire, tho.
That Michael Jackson movie's portrayal of him was wayyy off and almost fairytale-like. Like he had an EXTREME case of Peter Pan syndrome

@OUATEmmaSwan Killian continued to watch the movie mumbling. "Pan isn't nice, he's bloody evil. Wait....." He looked at Emma as it clicked ~
Peter Pan would have been a much better movie if Captain Hook looked like Killian from Once Upon a Time.

The movie with Peter Pan? Is the movie actually called "Peter Pan?"
Victor Frankenstein was more than a simple movie about a man, a monster and his friend Igor. 8/10. I have no idea why the critics pan this.
Peter Pan will always be my favorite childhood movie
That picture made me think of Pan's Labyrinth. That movie was sooooooo deep.

I get that it's an action movie, but you don't need to pan the camera around every person on the phone to create suspense. No. #Furious7
@Sklernks That was the most out-of-left-field gore in a "serious" movie since Pan's Labyrinth or so
i like the 1953 movie but just the concept of peter pan creeps me tf out idk how 2 explain why tho
Somehow should really try making a legit Peter Pan remake and see how fast it gets shut down by the PC Police. Seriously. Movie is terrible

Peter Pan is actually a really bad movie lolol
I liked the movie Pan's Labyrinth saw last night was a dark film but I liked the dark fairytale fantasy side to it.
@DakoofTacos imagine like, Pan's Labyrinth in feel but a game (not a game adaptation, I'm just saying a feel very similar to the movie
My family went to a movie without me. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel about this. I didn't exactly want to see Pan, so I'll survive.
PETER PAN IS SO GOOD I HAVE NEVER LOVED A MOVIE MORE

PANのサントラはジョン・パウエルファンでなくてもヒクドラシリーズの音楽が好きなら買うべき。映画をさらに盛り上げる素晴らしい楽曲の連発で、今までパウエルさんが培ってきた映画音楽の作曲スタイルが全てぶち込まれた集大成で、宣言通りこれでパウエルさんが引退してもおかしくない仕上がり。

『PAN』はただ単純に冒険譚を描くのではなく細部まで行き届いた演出が光る。この映画では幾度とピーターが落下して地面にぶつかる描写があるけれど、冒頭で海賊船から飛び降りることが出来なかったことやあのラストバトル、エピローグに繋がると、改めてピーターの成長譚なのだと気付かされる。

Pan was a really creative movie
EATING RAOUL, or the movie where the Eighties effectively bludgeon the Seventies to death with a frying pan.
can there be a movie where Peter Pan and Bambi meet
Highkey hyped about the new Peter Pan movie.
The movie Peter Pan begins because Wendy doesn't want her own room, which is less believable than everything else in that movie.
Since it's Peter Pan Tsum Tsum day, I'm watching the Tinkerbell movie for the first time. Oh boy. I nearly cried when they said--

Going away means forgetting. That line wasn't actually in Peter Pan. It was in the movie.
There's a reenactment of the CLASSIC Peter Pan movie out now and I aint even know about it, till yesterday at the Mall. SoO who wants to go?

Isaw Pan; it was cute. But, Kurt Cobain must have been rolling in his grave while Courtney rolled in all that cash from the movie royalties.
@rdt757 @apoure25 Yes! So many Pan Am bags in that movie!
And therefore we must leave the movie, which was 3/4 ABOUT HER and finding out her husband was a POS, with a lingering pan out on his pain.
Pan was such a cute movie I hope my dreams are similar tonight lol

@Pan_is_the_Man right! I'm sad the whole movie
@CaitlinCrandall @audreyvahgnur i watched it for the first time last night and yeah it was like the saddest movie ever

The new Hugh Jackman movie "Pan" was a flop according to my American teacher. When he was young I really liked his face but now not so much
the new Peter Pan movie is seriously so good
Can't tell if I'm having a bad trip or the new movie Pan is just really fucked up
Peter Pan from 2003 was definitely my first movie crush.
So #CrimsonPeak is probably Guillermo del Toro's most visually striking movie. Even more so than Pan's Labyrinth.
Pan was such a cute movie but boy did they butcher the Peter Pan story
I wish apple had Disney movie emojis like Peter Pan, Simba, and etc.
also i found $1 video tapes of peter pan (just watched with brother), nirvana in concert 93 or 94, and the donkey kong "movie"

I'm talking about the 80s movie not Peter Pan tho
My 11 year old's latest movie verdict: 'Pan' is more exciting than 'Spectre'.
I find it funny that Pan is a Greek creature but the movie is in Spain and he speaks Spanish....maybe they just used Pan as a general term
Ctrl+F Pan's Labyrinth's entry in this, a great @ruthlessreviews perspective on what makes the movie such an enduring work.
Guillermo Del Toro is one of my favorite directors of all time. Pan's labyrinth is my favorite movie. But Crimson Peak was not good at all

I could never pick an actual favorite movie, but when people ask, PAN'S LABYRINTH is what comes to mind. If you haven't seen it, you should.
The general consensus seems to be that Pan's Labyrinth is scary AF, but not necessarily a horror movie. I'm good with that.

@loudmouthjulia It's not a good movie and I won't defend it, but to pan it this hard is way over the top and too easy. Expected more/better.
@TVMoJoe @ScottMendelson You DO know he is producer of PAN and writer of the Green Lantern movie, right?
Went and watched PAN earlier at the cinema and now I'm watching Scary Movie! I love films me!
Okay after today I gotta rewatch the classic Peter Pan movie
Pan was such an awesome movie! I love Disney classics that Hollywood turns into live action. #neverland
Just saw the new Peter Pan movie and I was freaking out the whole time. Peter Pan is my one and only love

So excited to see the new Pan movie tomorrow
So I watch the new movie Pan today , it was good but I want a second one to come out soon
Pan the movie was doing OK, but never quite recovered from the Nirvana moment. A strange choice indeed.
i think the best part about the new peter pan movie was when all the lost boys sang Nirvana
