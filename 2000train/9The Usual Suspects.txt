I have some issue with movies like Lucia(kannada) or Fight Club. The suspense isn't interesting enough. The Usual Suspects is my kinda movie
The Italian Job remains my favorite movie, closely followed by, The Usual Suspects, Ocean's Eleven, The Shawshank Redemption and 3 Idiots.
The usual suspects is a great movie.
