@brennenotoole some movie about Lizzie Borden
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/qrNupi0neiI?a  The Legend of Lizzie Borden (TV Movie 1975)
Next year Sundance, promo for all of her movies, maybe festivals like Cannes (fingers crossed), Lizzie Borden movie, Chanel campaign
@AlexStto this is what I'm hoping for I need her to drop the Lizzie Borden movie and work with some great foreign directors instead
I saw her Lizzie Borden movie and it was entertaining. ("Lizzie Borden Took an Ax") And the reviews for "Z" make it sound good.
"Lizzie Borden Took an Ax" (2014) is a layered movie (C) #AhiMovieReviews <nyglz3>
The Lizzie Borden movie is meh to me I'm so over Lizzie Borden movies. I just need K to play a psychotic killer already
I hope she'd look like this in that Lizzie Borden movie. pic.twitter.com/9xPmsDuF3V
At least we know how Kristen will look in the Lizzie Borden movie :)
When does filming start for the Lizzie Borden movie?
How is that Christina Ricci Lizzie Borden movie?
i watched lizzie borden took an ax yesterday it was such a bad movie
So K confirmed she will be in Lizzie Borden's movie?
" Kristen will play Chloe Sevigny's character's lover in the Lizzie Borden Movie" pic.twitter.com/QHJMwG8mnm

Watching the movie Lizzie Borden Took an Ax and it's creepy
I thought Lizzie Borden Took an Ax was going to be a horror movie but Boy Was I Wrong. It’s basically the world’s most boring biopic
Lizzie Borden Took an Axe, a #Netflix original, gets 3 of 5 stars. While more historically accurate than most, it wasn't a stand out movie.
@Kittyk_77 That's the one!!! And the movie's called Lizzie Borden Took An Ax. Movie goes first, the series follows on. was it on netflix?
Alone? Check. Almost 11 pm? Check. Lizzie Borden movie? Check. I'm sure this will turn out well. #poorlifechoices #regretitlater
Ano gani tong Lizzie Borden took an ax na movie hahaha
(when I first met I just 'so I follow your instagram and twitter' and then i remembered it was because of @bethrevis & Lizzie Borden movie)

@daiihuan If you interested ... watch this movie based on true story : Lizzie Borden Took An Ax #Trailer: https://youtu.be/yJBO66pNNf4  #Theory
I really don't understand why Lizzie Borden was used for a Lifetime movie and now a TV show. Like seriously, that's so crazy & freaky! :o
Oh snap they made that Lizzie Borden movie into a series. Christina Ricci killed that role.
This Lifetime movie about Lizzie Borden is everything I never knew I wanted.
I was very disappointed w the lifetime Lizzie Borden movie why are they making it into a series now
Lizzie Borden took an Ax >>> love this movie.
They are showing movie "Lizzy Borden Took An Ax" on Lifetime often until Sunday when the new series "The Lizzie Borden Chronicles" starts.
my parents are watching the lizzie borden movie & im listening to pandora
I'm currently watching a Lizzie Borden movie.... Would definitely want to know that answer. And Jack the Ripper. And JonBenét Ramsey.
Until then I'm watching this Lizzie Borden Movie Crazy bitch
There.........is a lifetime movie................about lizzie borden...................i am loving this concept
This Lizzie Borden movie is on and I can't stop thinking of the Boy Meets World Episode. LIZZIE BORDEN HAD AN AX, GAVE HER HUSBAND 40 WHACKS
Christina Ricci is playing Lizzie Borden in a new movie. Somebody's been reading my erotic fanfic.

Lizzie Borden Chronicles the movie Lizzie Borden Took An Ax was good.
I'm feeling down, so imma go eat some nachos and watch a 1970s Lizzie Borden movie.
@juliashleyy @Mathew_Mata she also played in Lizzie Borden had an axe, it was a pretty good movie
Why is Lifetime making a series about Lizzie Borden the movie was enough
Just went from the campy Lifetime Lizzie Borden movie to the documentary about installing the 340-ton boulder in LA #gottalovenetflix
@CryssAlyssa I did I watched all the surrogacy movies and probably every lifetime movie there is. Lizzie Borden was good too
Christina Ricci replaced Mila Kunis in the Lizzie Borden movie because Mila got too excited with the axe - #MovieFakeFacts
Sometimes TV confuses me. "When should we premiere Salem & a Lizzie Borden show & a Flowers in the Attic movie?" "Oh, Easter, absolutely."
I'm excited for The Lizzie Borden Chronicles. Christina Ricci was so good in the movie.
So I need to watch that Lizzie Borden TV movie. Apparently it is going to be a TV show?!
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/qrNupi0neiI?a  The Legend of Lizzie Borden (TV Movie 1975)
Great News: The Lizzie Borden movie w/Christina Ricci is being made into a series!!! Terrible news: It's gonna be on Lifetime D:
@moraven12 @ChristinaRicci have you seen the 2014 Lifetime movie of Lizzie Borden? It's same cast and series follows it :)
Ooooo new Clea in a Lizzie Borden movie on April 5th! Yessssss @lifetimetv

@JokerXtreme78 I love her, she really does. And she did play Lizzie Borden in a Lifetime movie! I knew it.
@JokerXtreme78 I feel like she already played Lizzie Borden in a made for TV movie. Either way I'll probably check the show out.
I didn't particularly like the Lizzie Borden movie. Curious as to why they made it into a show. There's not much left.
i am so excited for the lizzie borden chronicles because christina ricci is a total babe and i loved the movie she was in
So, there's a new Lizzie Borden movie coming out..

if anyone wants to watch a good movie on netflix check out 'lizzie'. it's about the crime in 1892 of the hatchet murder lizzie borden.
If anyone has watched that Lizzie Borden movie on Netflix can we agree that whole soundtrack is amazing?

Wow this Lizzie Borden movie is odd, it actually has me questioning if she really did it
This Lizzie Borden movie is a damn mess.
Netflix has the Lizzie Borden movie with @ChristinaRicci movie time!
There is just altogether too much acting going on in this @lifetimetv Lizzie Borden movie.
I've told the twins so many times that I want to watch the Lizzie Borden movie and we finally are, but I'm really scared.

"Lizzie Borden took an ax" Great movie
btw that new Lizzie Borden movie on Netflix is fye.

Whoever chose the modern rock soundtrack for this Lizzie Borden movie should be shot from a cannon into another cannon in perpetuity.
"I think Lizzie Borden killed both of her parents with an ax." - actual dialogue from a real movie made, presumably, by professionals.
did they have house parties back when lizzie borden was alive or is this movie just very historically incorrect.
watching lizzie borden took an axe with my sisters and so far this is the funniest movie i've ever seen
//So I'm watching "Lizzie Borden Took An Axe" & Its an ok movie, except for the music.

From what I've deduced from the Lifetime Original Movie, Lizzie Borden definitely DID do it.
The soundtrack to the Lifetime Original Movie, "Lizzie Borden Took an Axe", is super out of place. Constant blues? 1890's in Massachusetts?
