#NowWatching Watchmen #Movie for the first time
One of the best scene from "Watchmen"..You are locked in here with me! https://youtu.be/JJ5290-0lw0 
Watchmen is four and a half hours long Great movie
If they had cast Ozymandias better, the Watchmen movie would've been better.
I still haven't seen the watchmen movie because I know it cuts out literally the whole comic but I know the soundtrack bc of mcr???
Watchmen is the Best Superhero Movie ever made. Apologies to Winter Soldier, Avengers and The Dark Knight.
#Watchmen because: f*ck you, that's why. I love this movie. :-)
I've seen this movie too many times, I'm gonna watch it again! #watchmen https://www.instagram.com/p/_Til9MptZ6/

the only good dc movie post 2000 was watchmen bcus the grittiness and the weirdly plastic costumes was a whole satire on superheroes

Watchmen is still a fire movie!
WATCHMEN is the best comic book movie ever made! Also, @jackieearle as Rorschach gives the BEST performance in a comic book movie #Watchmen
@tmiobsessed if suicide squad takes your fancy then watchmen should be on your list! It's a very dark superhero movie! I love it!
Omg Watchmen is the freaking best comic I've ever read... And it's way more awesome than the movie
Any Watchmen fans wanna write an essay for me comparing the original comic and the movie adaptation? :)))))
I thought Watchmen was a cool movie I DONT CARE WHAT YOU THINK
No, Rorschach, NOOOOOOOOO!!! — watching Watchmen Movie
Sorry we LOVE WATCHMEN we've read the book twice all the way through and watched the movie four times
People have criticised the Watchmen movie for a bunch of things, but I've never heard anyone call it bloated.

It's probably a good thing that Watchmen is like 10 hours long or I would watch it every time I wanna watch movie.

Might as well watch the Watchmen movie since i finished the comic book today
Also the best superhero movie after Watchmen because I don't want Baymax to be offed by a civilian
@Anasiaz well, when you get the chance. Will McAvoy - The Newsroom (TV) Rorschach - Watchmen (Movie) Han Solo - Star Wars 4-6 (original)
I know I am very behind on this, but I just finished the movie Watchmen and I loved it. Rorschach was my favorite. Team @DCComics > @Marvel.
The Watchmen movie had a better ending than the comic.
Watching the Watchmen movie again and it hasn't gotten better since @chelseacomics and I were let down the first time. *sigh*
Watchmen is low key my favorite comic book movie
The Watchmen is a good but fucked up movie
Watchmen is gotta be my most favorite movie of all time
Honestly the Watchmen movie is so great I wish there was more tbh.
watchmen is the best superhero movie ever made
"watchmen" is coming on tonight and i'm have a tbt when this movie and comic were my entire world and i loved tf out of it and still do

Sat down to rewatch the best scenes from The Watchmen. Skip the boring parts. Watched the whole dammed movie. #NoRegrets
@D4Darious @PerryWhiteArt Watchmen has to be my favorite superhero movie of all time tbh

Watching #WatchMen for at least the 10th time. Great movie!

Reading Watchmen comic. I know it's the other way around but I feel like reading a storyboard of the movie. Which isn't a bad thing.

Who could have guessed Zack Snyder would make another superhero movie that makes Watchmen look low-key and subtle.
Watchmen is Zack Snyder's best movie.
Watchmen is the greatest superhero movie ever made and is the reason I have so much hope for this new batman movie
Dunno. I loved Watchmen movie. But the story was a commentary on a political world that's much different now. https://twitter.com/bristei/status/672444601840615424 …
@Deggans Watchmen worked best as a comic and perhaps need not have been made into a movie or TV show
@YungCostanza @SlimiHendrix watchmen was the last time I "followed" a super hero movie being made and I gave Snyder benefit of the doubt
people gotta stop acting like Zack Snyder is gonna make a good movie this time. I say this as a Watchmen apologist
People who don't believe in Batfleck probably also don't know that Watchmen is the best superhero movie that's ever come out
@RasheezySpeaks I'm still not over how he did Watchmen and it's been years. He has all the essentials of an epic superhero movie down pat
I just realized that the Hootsuite Owl Mask sort of resembles the mask of Nite Owl from the Watchmen Movie. http://fb.me/7NhckmMWX 
@AmyZiegfeld Watchmen I loved the trailer. Thought the movie was all right. MoS i thought had good parts but overall disappointed me.
The kinda girl who'll sit and watch the whole Watchmen movie with you
Now more hyped for Civil War,the directors of it gave us Captain America:Winter Soldier,which's the best comic book movie since TDK/Watchmen
WATCH SYNDER FUCK UP THE BATMAN VS SUPERMAN MOVIE LIKE HE DID TO WATCHMEN, 300 AND MAN OF STEEL. MARK MY WORDS FUCCBOIZ
This movie Watchmen is really good.
When life gets tough, I take out my frustration on the movie adaptation of Watchmen
Basically Zack Snyder made one good movie (Watchmen) and a bunch of other eh movies and other bad movies i don't really trust him
Watchmen is a long movie so I guess I'll be up for a while
For #Watchmen to have been done properly it should have been made into a 6-part TV movie. #hindsight
YOU KNOW WHAT WHILE WE'RE TAKING ABT SNYDER: I think the worst part about the Watchmen movie is that it could have been good. there were
#shawshanked by WATCHMEN . Never been a big comic/graphic novel guy but really enjoyed reading it. Movie did good job w/tough material.
Watchmen has to be the worst superhero movie ever made.. It's just terrible I can't even sit through it
Watchmen is the best comic book movie of all time. Argue with a wall
The #Watchmen movie is on the IFC channel for anyone interested #movies
Yes Jeffrey is hot. Did you see the YouTube click I posted a week or 2 ago on this hero movie The Watchmen? https://twitter.com/laralee1199/status/672229350763323392 …
Just sitting here realizing studios were so hot on comic movies that they made a Watchmen movie.wonder if whoever ok'd the money had read it
@destroysuperman @thehorrorchick I'm out of town cuz its the Jerktown Rally where every1 gathers to watch the jerkiest movie, The Watchmen!
Watchmen is such an underrated movie
Watchmen is such a long movie... but I can't help but watch it when it's on. Nobody will watch it with me tho
Somebody just said "Watchmen" was the worst super hero movie ever. Their opinion is trash.
Geeks and geeks alike. This imbecile said that that Watchmen was the worst movie in comic book history https://twitter.com/prettybrwnaless/status/672117917090226177 …
I hate hate hate the watchmen movie but I'm also obsessed with that book so...
The castaway part of Watchmen is a strong reason that that book is an amazing piece of literature. But it had to be left out of the movie
I think Watchmen (the movie) would've been MUCH better received if the studio didn't try to sell it as an action movie
@Charleygayle Almost Famous is the best and the guy who plays Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen is the same hot guy in that movie
@dvnbrennan love Watchmen. Movie was fine, but weirdly strict in its adaptation. It was an ok movie that felt unnecessary
#ENGL220C Having the comics come to life in the movie, "Watchmen" allowed me to see the more foreshadowing than in the comic
I TOLD DAD THE STORY BEHIND WATCHMEN AND HE WAS IMPRESSED BC ITS HIS FAV COMIC MOVIE AND WAS LIKE "COOL" WHEN I SAID MCR DID DESOLATION ROW
I like Alan Moore in Alan Moore stuff even if Watchmen movie was not as good as the book. But not in my Superman https://twitter.com/jackmcd83/status/671839105614028804 …
I like Watchmen a lot but the book is terrifyingly vast. The movie is pretty good though.
Zack Snyder made the Watchmen movie possible so I believe in him with Superman v Batman

What if Batman V. Superman is Watchmen (the movie), plus thirty years?
the watchmen was a bad movie
@ThatAquaWriter @Daulfus The original ending to watchmen is also ridiculous and would have been savaged by critics. Movie is much tidier.

Watchmen could have been a near perfect movie if there was more character development to Ozymandias imo
@comicnoobshow The Watchmen movie should have been released in about 2018, after the public has superhero vocab. Discuss.
The Watchmen movie's costume design is really frustrating.

Kickass and Watchmen are criticisms on superheroes... something which is completely ignored in the movie adaptations.
@IlGlaz WATCHMEN is probably his best movie but even then he hampers himself. I dig DAWN a lot for being a full on romp. I want THAT Snyder.
I forgot how dope The Watchmen movie was. Rorschach was brutal.

Watchmen is a classic. Best graphic novel I've read easy. Movie was cool too though.

Watchmen is an incredibly underrated movie
Watchmen is a dope ass movie
Ew. Watchmen was a terrible movie. It was 3 hours of nothing.
Watchmen had so many subliminal messages in it. So many conspiracy theories. Dope ass movie. Long, but dope.
I dont own Watchmen. The movie or the comic. I am failing.
Know what movie knocked me out in the theater? WATCHMEN. I remember that fire nap like yesterday.
What I really want is another dark R rated superhero movie like The Watchmen

watchmen was so ahead of its time both the comic and the movie
the watchmen movie is a cinematic masterpiece
Also, I had forgotten Watchmen-movie had such a good soundtrack. Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah in the s-scene cracks me up
I think I need to shower now to cleanse myself of the trash that is the Watchmen movie.
David Hayter, Alex Tse, and Zack Snyder can crawl in a hole and die discussing all the things they did wrong creating the Watchmen movie.
Just like the movie watchmen said (God doesn't make the world crazy,...Men do) he doesn't seen to care also so why praise him.
heres a tip: if u never have, dont read watchmen and dont u dare watch the movie

@SuperheroFeed Comics no question. The best comic book movie IMO is The Watchmen.
What did you people think about the Watchmen movie? Unforgettable just came on at the bar.
As much as I love movie Watchmen, Zach Snyder has the subtlety of a nuke. Book handles surprises so much better. Movie ruins them all early

This Goddamn movie killed off its best charachter!!!! Damn you Watchmen!! Damn you to hell!!!! *sobs at the dearh of Rorschach*
The Watchmen movie to me was so ahead of its time. Gets better with each viewing. A cerebral film based on a cerebral comic.
Was anyone in the Watchmen movie ever in anything else again?
The sex scene in WATCHMEN is still one of the most unintentionally hilarious movie sex scenes in recent memory.
watchmen is a dope ass movie
Forgot how awesome Watchmen movie was (aside from the blue dongage).
Watchmen is such a great movie. I still love it.
Watchmen is on, and I'm still blown away that this movie even got made.
Watchmen is an underrated movie, definitely one of my favorites.
Watchmen sucks but somehow its still a really good movie
@traderstewie this is like the The Watchmen movie... super villains to unite the countries that don't get along. New World Order coming.
"Watchmen" is my favorite movie because it's bloody/gory about superheroes in the 70's with a kickass soundtrack.
Barely missed my favorite part of the Watchmen movie. I'm sad now. Needed a good unintentional chuckle. #nightowlsilkspectreIIsex #teehee
Movie Watchmen makes no sense
I can't recall how they changed the ending in the Watchmen movie. I did see it, but wasn't too impressed. Worked superbly on the page.
I know the "Watchmen" movie was considered a flop, but I'll be damned if I don't watch it every time it's on.
The best part of the Watchmen movie is the opening credits

The problem with Watchmen is at issue 6 I'm starting to suspect the movie was superior in every way.
@Maxplatypus Best thing about Watchmen was that it was an ambitious piece of editorial design; that's why hardcore fans didn't want a movie.

@settlingstatic as the only one in the world who liked the watchmen movie.... hell yea
Watchmen talks about how shitty our society is. The whole movie has this whole rainy grayish atmosphere just to highlight that fact.
Watchmen is definitely the best superhero movie out there. So many layers
@ReesMag Can't believe I was mad at Watchmen movie failing the source material. I didn't know this was possible.

So I've read the graphic novel and I still thought the Watchmen movie was really good even after seeing it a couple times?
@anmcdaniee WATCHMEN, The Shawshank Redemption and Bee Movie are among my favorites
Watchmen was a Rated R movie with one 1 powered hero. It still worked. #BlackComicsChat
the opening to watchmen was one of the best film sequences ive seen it's better than the rest of the movie
This word and its society, sometimes make me feel like The Comedian from the movie #Watchmen was so right about them.

Dr Manhattan was perfectly done in this movie. #Watchmen
Watchmen is a damn good movie, why don't people talk about this movie enough? It's by far one the best comic-based films around.
watchinh Watchmen.. this movie is so fuckin dope
The movie 'Watchmen' is so boring. Worst superhero movie ever.
BTW for all the haters who say SKYFALL wasn’t a real Bond movie, I guess you also hate Watchmen because it wasn’t a real Blue Beetle story!
The watchmen is the best movie dc has made yet.
@FO_ScottKacsmar in today's over-saturated superhero movie market, Watchmen is such a refreshing take on it.
ah yes, november 5th, the day we all remember that time the Watchmen movie used leonard cohen's "hallelujah" to soundtrack a sex scene
@d3sk @IndyCENLibrary @IndyPLGlendale @indypl_HVL Well, unless he's reading Late period Frank Miller. or liked the Watchmen movie.

The Watchmen movie would probably be about an hour shorter if there wasn't so much damn slow motion
I haven't read the Watchmen comics, nor have I seen the movie until now, but at least I may have a feel of what Deadpool will be like...?
Watchmen would have been done much better as a mini-series. just so much trying to be packed into one movie.
Watchmen = Favorite Superhero Movie
Have you ever met someone who saw the Watchmen movie first, then read the comic and said "The comic is way better" or "worse"?
Oh god. The actor who played Rorschach in the Watchmen movie just favourited all my tweets slagging off the Watchmen movie. Very scared now.
Zack Snyder's Watchmen is the most accurate comic book movie ever made. Every shot is literally in the book. Wow
Watchmen is one insightful movie. I'd love to see Dr. Manhattan's travels throughout the Universe, if it were possible. #Rewatch #Watchmen
The Watchmen movie would have been greatly improved with Chapter breaks. As it is, the story structure is very awkward and messy.
Wasn't Watchmen a pretty big movie when it came out?!

I LOVE the WATCHMEN movie but I would lose it if a panel for panel TV series actually happened!!! #Watchmen
The movie was cool. HBO does some amazing programming so you know it will be good. @HBO @watchmen https://twitter.com/adamhlavac/status/649731773350285312 …

The Watchmen movie is so underrated
The watchmen movie is over 3 hours long are you kidding me
@HBO #Watchmen series would be the best show on tv if they keep the dark and gritty feel of the movie! Go HBO!!!! pic.twitter.com/UWiHIjsOfk

Ever since the Watchmen movie came out I thought it would better as an HBO mini series. I am getting that but I want @ZackSnyder gone.
One thing I remember about the Watchmen movie: Doc Manhattan's blue CG dong and how they tried to not draw attention to it.
#Watchmen TV series, eh. I prefer it as a movie which i do own.

@GBRIELGRY I think Watchmen lends itself more to serial television as oppose to a movie.

I'd like HBO Watchmen to be a 12 part bi-weekly series that follows the story. It feels like it'd do more justice than a movie.
I don't see why people bash on Watchmen. It's a great movie that stays mostly faithful to the source material.

I can't see a revival of #Watchmen as a movie anytime soon. But the way the team and their powers work, a potential HBO show would be hype
I'm a fan of Snyder's 'Watchmen' movie, but a TV miniseries is the best approach for the story.

@scorntrooper It's as good as a Watchmen movie could possibly be, style and tone-wise.
I had no idea the Watchmen movie was so disliked. Why? I loved it. And yes I read the source material prior to viewing the film.
I think I’m in the minority for liking the #Watchmen movie. A show could be even better
@SchmoesJTE Re-doing #Watchmen or adapting #BeforeWatchmen? Anyone know? I think Watchmen is super underrated, prob Snyder's best movie
Random Simon & Garfunkel in my playlist. Ain't even mad. Everything that reminds me of the Watchmen movie is good in my book.
The Watchmen movie was not that great And would be confusing as all hell if I didn't read the source material
What's really cool about a potential #Watchmen series on HBO is that you could probably get the original movie cast back together. Badass.
@TotalDogBiscuit @andrewgleason Watchmen is a great story and the movie wasn't that bad, but it's a stand alone story. THE. END.

Watchmen for some reason really resonated with me. I love the movie even though it has some issues but I love the character of Rorschach
Watched the 2009 movie "Watchmen" yesterday. Not gonna lie, I still don't understand the ending...
The opening of Watchmen is the best...or, I mean the whole movie itself..lol :)

I know everyone will hate me for saying it, but I loved the watchmen movie. even after I read the comic.

@darboo_smith for some reason I feel that you'd like the soundtrack for the movie Watchmen. Check it out.
notes on watchmen: but where is that cool animal matthew goode had in the movie
I feel like watching watchmen again but that movie like 3 hours long bruhhh
Watchmen movie watched. Better than expected. It portrays nasty side of superheros and it's not obvious what happens next
@sonofken @seanpphillips like the Watchmen movie. They took something great and made something good.
Damn Watchmen is a great movie

@chaffXgrenade well I'm just sayin', if the first movie was Watchmen for kids then the next step would be Kingdom Come for kids
watchmen is the best superhero movie of all time
Let me know if you can analyze Watchmen movie for me
Dragon Ball Evolution was "was nominated for a 2009 Spike TV Scream Award for "Best Comic Book Movie," but lost to Watchmen." I just what
Will there be another Watchmen movie? via http://www.advancesafetysolutions.com 
I think a lot of the soundtrack from The Watchmen falls under the category of I've heard this shit a billion times in a movie before.
The Incredibles is still the best superhero movie yet made (even if it did steal from WATCHMEN) https://twitter.com/LRNews/status/643504064618229760 …
@bmr378 That would be bangin'. Especially if it looks a bit like Miss Jupiter from the Watchmen movie.

I wonder if we ever have a #ManofSteel directors cut? I feel like is a Snyder thing. Same as with Watchmen. making the movie even better.
The fact that anybody can see the Watchmen movie and think it's a "perfect" translation of the book is proof of reader-response theory.

I feel like watching the movie the watchmen just so I can see Rochette he made that movie
i loved "watchmen" a superhero movie that actually showed us that HERO's too can be (and probably are) badly flawed.
You mean Watchmen, the best comic book movie of all time and that actually improved on Moore's novel? @4LoveOfTheRoad @jermhudson
@ding0036 Could be. But something about Watchmen (the movie and graphic novel) makes me thing the writer is deeply not silly and campy.

Watching "The Watchmen" for the fourth time. What an excruciatingly flawed movie. Mismatched music, poorly cast, but some great moments
The biggest mistake with the Watchmen movie was trying to make it a shot for shot of the comic.
Dean Ambrose is like a comic book series that fans pretend 2 like until the movie comes out and nobody watches. Ambrose is like The Watchmen
Watchmen done Nice movie
watchmen is a great movie and i will fight anyone that disagrees
I am kinda glad the The Watchmen movie had Rorschach's mask be randomly moving around, instead of like in the book with of images of my mom.

The Watchmen movie is a fairly good take on the graphic novel, aside from a few choices that take you out of the film. Still good, however.

Does Watchmen have the best credit sequence in the history of movies? Another favourite is Once Upon a Time in the West. #movie #moviemaking
@MartiBro14 @SpinkyMJB I fall asleep every time I watch Watchmen. I usually watch it at night, and it's a long ass movie

If WATCHMEN was released today, it would be a huge game changer for movie-goers.

An insightful review of the 'Watchmen' (graphic novel, not movie tho that was good too!) by Thug Notes (Spoilers!) https://youtu.be/D3Qfm1z94BA 
Watchmen is an underrated superhero movie.
the concept for watchmen was cool and the comics seem good but that movie was boring af and a chore to sit through
Watchmen hands down the best superhero movie made.
@gizmo151183 @tokyotrannyboy so Watchmen is still the best comic movie penis, I guess. I thought a naked Thing might change that
@crashcarr I love the batman movies, love the last superman and dug Watchmen movie. I am glad they arent making all movies for everyone
@XJinzai_CutterX What if I'd rather just watch Watchmen? It's really the best superhero movie there is #oocandic
Did the Watchmen movie change comics, and movies, for the worse?
I could make a better movie than "Watchmen" by filming my one-man show where I play all the watchmen: "WATCHMAN"
People thought of it as a strict cheesy superhero movie, but watchmen ended up being more politically, intellectually based so called boring
@TORIgotDOE what was your favorite part of the watchmen movie lol? Mine was ozymandias catching silk spectres bullets

@JoeMulv The dude that played the Comedian in the Watchmen movie would be my first pick.
#Watchmen is such an underrated movie, and the opening montage is one of the coolest scenes I've ever seen. #WhoWatchesTheWatchmen
@kelseyr713 Watchmen! I kinda forgot the Spawn movie existed TBH.
Scenario: 'Watchmen' is about to be rebooted for the DCEU. You get to cast the group. Who do you choose? (Not the cast of the Znyder movie)
I forgot how good the Watchmen movie was. I mean, that title sequence pulls you right in gah
if you're ever sad remember "the watchmen" the movie and dr manhattan's floppy blue dick waggling onscreen
I like the #watchmen comic, always thought they changed the ending for the movie because they're going to do it in real life. Just sayin.

Why do men find talking to women so difficult? Just ask her how she feels about the changes made in the movie version of Watchmen.

Almost 3am, and we're starting the beginning of the extended Watchmen movie. Good life choices
#Watchmen is still my favourite Comic Book Movie. Perfect cast, directing, music, CGI. Outstanding.
I hate how the movie Watchmen is criticized for being too loyal to the source material.
does the Watchmen movie an addaptation of the comic or the characters?
Finally saw Watchmen, and I'm really glad I didn't watch that when I was 13 just to see the movie the MCR song came from. Also loved Adrian.

Hollis' attack in Watchmen Ultimate Version is probably the best scene of the whole movie. Great stuff.

glad to learn at lunch yesterday I’m not alone in not thinking much [overall] of the movie of Watchmen. (or the book art. Love the writing!)
First time watching the Watchmen since the theatre. This movie is so... off. Faithful, yet empty.
We could live in a world where Alan Moore gets to bitch a/b the #Watchmen movie by saying the porn parody was better...
But far Watchmen has the best soundtrack for a comic book movie ever let's hope Zack Snyder steps it up again with Dawn of Justice
Whoever mentioned "The Man From Earth" a few months back, I think you've just replaced Watchmen as my go-to drinking movie

Despite having already watched the movie, I still don't get tired of watching the Watchmen trailer.

Yeah, I don't know how Batman Vs Superman won't be the darkest superhero movie since Watchmen.

Watchmen is the most aesthetic superhero movie you will ever watch it's freaking beautiful, if you have read the comic you should watch it
hmmm i should re watch all my fave movies, i need to buy the watchmen movie and snow piercer anyways
(Watchmen isn't a '""'superhero movie"''") (please) (stop) (it) (you are hurting my nerd)
watchmen a 3 hour movie, got dammit.
@HDKG Watchmen is the second best DC Comic movie of all time, and movie reviewers agree.

Watchmen is the best superhero movie ever. Better than the avengers
@DeLuxODonnell92 I'd probably call Watchmen the biggest budgeted movie made for a niche audience
Screw critic ratings watchmen was a good movie
really hoping my praise/defense of True Detective s02 isn't indicative of the delusion I displayed on the release of the Watchmen movie.
Time to revisit #watchmen. I love this movie.

I actually really liked the Watchmen movie.
@danglouie It's a Main Street set built for Watchmen and used by almost every big movie since like Godzilla as well as Supernatural, Arrow..

@ZwickKatie Ant Man was a literal "genre film" which no other superhero movie has been since Watchmen. It was very refreshing to me.

@DrGhett0Batman I would have never read Watchmen if it wasn't for the movie, and i'm sure theres many people who did the same as me.
wait a hot second are they making another watchmen movie? because no thanks
@NathGriff i can hardly talk - my top are like Watchmen, Lego Movie and The Dark Knight
I'd put Watchmen over every DC comic book movie made except Dark Knight.
If Suicide Squad ends up being as good or close to as good as Watchmen, how can you make a fuss about it? Watchmen one of best movie's ever.
And I actually like Snyder's work. Think Watchmen gets a really bad rap and Sucker Punch is at the very least a visually appealing movie
I don't care what anyone says, #watchmen is the best comic movie to date.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/JJ5290-0lw0?a  Watchmen (5/9) Movie CLIP - You're Locked In Here With Me! (2009) HD
@Blackmage408 as much as I dislike certain parts of the movie, The Watchmen is an excellent counterpoint to these criticisms.
Watchmen is the best superhero movie in my opinion. Well not really a superhero movie but u get it. So complex and well made
@AsiaArgento like Snyder's watchmen...the opening credits were the only good part of the movie
Whenever I hear the words "watchmen is the greatest movie ever made" my craving to watch it increases

Watching #directorscut of @watchmen. Without a doubt this is a perfect movie.
@nickspannaus I think it's however long it took to produce the movie that you removed. So, for Watchmen, that'll be... about 22 years.
Watchmen is the only comicbook movie where the heroes don't win.
Watchmen is a long movie. Rorschach makes it somewhat worth it though.
Will I be confused if I start reading "Go Set a Watchman" if I hadn't read the prior comics nor seen The Watchmen movie?
Favorite movie memory was watching the opening credits for Watchmen! best montage/opening credits ever #RegalCokeSweeps

@darth_indica idk, have you seen/read Watchmen? The movie is pretty much word for word the book!
@TheAhmedRaafat Exactly! Ironically enough I didn't like Watchmen the first time I saw it (because it was branded as a superhero movie)
Watchmen still the best comic book movie
The Watchmen has to be one of the best superhero movie, I can't believe it's not that known
Can’t believe the people @_RocketFM don’t like the Watchmen movie. I’ve read the comic and think it’s a fine adaptation.

I forgot how awesome a movie Watchmen is. The comic is even better
@NilkadNaquada this is 100% the reason nightowl got a costume redesign in the watchmen movie. His costume would've looked retarded on screen

@BlackGirlNerds how amazing to see my first movie hero, @jackieearle 'fav' a tweet mentioning Watchmen. Breaking Away was so special 2 me.
My opinion on "Go Set a Watchmen"'s publication is that it's like the unwanted sequels of the movie industry lately. We'll see, I suppose.
Watchmen is such a good movie
@ProducerTD SS interests me the most because we haven't seen a "comic book movie" like this… prob since Watchmen.
@zaconbothsides @BlackGirlNerds watchmen trailer blew me away. Saw the movie and was bored senseless.

Not the only reason why Watchmen was so great though, that movie is just golden for a slew of reasons.

Watchmen was the worst superhero movie ever made its almost as bad as the Hulk
@Rokiaaaaa admittedly, I've yet to watch a dc movie aside from the Watchmen which was more of a novel series.
Speaking of which. watchmen was a great movie too. No Idea whatsoever how anyone can dislike it.
@beckanicolej And everyone always forgets about Watchmen. Such a great movie by DC Comics.

The Watchmen will forever be my favorite movie.
Watchmen is such a great movie
Suicide squad looks watchmen-esque wich was a great movie i had no prior knowledge about. It takes more than pointless acton to impress me
I finally saw the movie Watchmen & I think that the only people that can enjoy it are comic book nerds & cynics. Luckily, I'm both.
@Taylor_Cruze @SCW_DavidHelms @William_B_Mason ive read watchmen like a dozen times i love that book but the movie disapointed me
@Taylor_Cruze @SCW_DavidHelms ooc it made me like one of my fav stories less and it was an ok movie it just wasnt good enough for watchmen
@ESPNBoise @CoachMikeESPN best superhero movie is #Watchmen hands down, closely followed by #DarkKnight
If Suicide Squad was a person it'd be the guy who won't shut up about how great the Watchmen movie was in 2015.
I don't get where this Watchmen sequel is going. Why even make a sequel when the movie mis- That's actually Batman and Superman? Oh, dear...
Watchmen Is A Good Ass Movie
Watchmen is on TV and it's frustrating because it's so nearly a great movie. It should've been adapted as an HBO show.

@oldhat I think that his movie of Watchmen seemed hollow, like he got all the aesthetics but missed a few really important points.
Hey @notaxation, you should really checkout the movie Watchmen. Very grounded alternate history take on Superheroes from Zack Snyder.
@thelindsayellis Watchmen - whatever else, the soundtrack choices for that movie were on point. That opening sequence!

@Rallo_64 I mean they're trying to make their movies in same tone as Watchmen. Every single movie in Zack Snyder style, which is depressing.
@Rallo_64 they have always killed with their shows, and will continue to kill with their shows. Not every movie DC movie can be Watchmen.

@PatchfaceTF @VK_HM I also generally like the Watchmen movie but have decided that's mostly because of the source, not Snyder
@VK_HM @TheWillThe I haven't watched or read that. Weirdly enough I find the Watchmen movie adequate but MoS is just...awful
@CrusherJ DotD notwithstanding his "darkest" movie is probably Watchmen, and that's mostly from from its source rather than anything he did.

@Soundtrepreneur Hahaha, I didn't like Watchmen tho. Felt like the movie totally misrepresented the book. Tapi itu cerita lain hari. Haha.
@heathercampbell i feel very similarly. It was a good movie but not one i ever say 'man I feel like watching The Watchmen'
I have no notes on the execution of Watchmen (the movie). I just wish I had liked it more. I wish I wanted to watch it.
@whobander Also a mistake but Zac Snyder made the watchmen, another wavyyyy Dc movie
@ShatrawSays ... Man, how I loathe The Watchmen movie!
@AndrewBerkshire I was always partial to V, but I think you got it bang on. Didn't like the major plot change in the Watchmen movie
@PreacherTW Comic: Watchmen. Movie: V for Vendetta.
@awya you dig crappy movie like it follows but you don't dig watchmen? Blasphemy!
What I loved about the Suicide Squad teaser is it had dark themes, a lot like watchmen & thats perfect for a comic book movie about villains
watchmen is such a great movie, perfect amount of reality/comic allure & darkness.
@jtyankees23 It's the main reason why Watchmen is far and away my favorite comic movie. They didn't make everything "cool/techy" suit wise.
@tmunzar @ZarrarKhuhro very watchmen-ish tha. But I enjoyed that movie. Almost as good as trailer. I'll settle for that.
@alikhalidrana @ZarrarKhuhro Yep, my bets are on it being a repeat of Watchmen, Man of Steel in that regard. Trailer > Movie. Hope I'm wrong
Well, I'll watch the Watchmen until some other movie appeals to me.

Still bitter about Watchmen. The ending of the movie makes no sense and I refuse to acknowledge the movie as anything but a travesty.
So the new batman vs superman trailer just redeemed the movie for me but then again watchmen looked dope as fuck too but let everyone down
@Hernan1897 I really like zach snyder I am a big fan of the movie watchmen but this is not watchmen. The guy can create impressive scenery
300 trailer & movie , Watchmen trailer &amp; movie , Sucker Punch trailer /didn't see movie, Man of Steel trailer meh/movie meh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@NerdyAndQuirky @ngjenkins The only movie I really enjoy of his is Watchmen, which everyone else seems to hate
Oh my god David Hayter was one of the screenwriters for the Watchmen movie??
@arnav_goel Yes. I am literally laughing and crying at the same time. My 2 fav superhero movie - TDK and Watchmen. "It's all a joke" :D:D
Good trailer, horrible movie: 300 Good trailer, good movie (and I'll force anyone who says otherwise to see the full version): Watchmen
But those are the same people who hate Snyder's Watchmen and I really like that movie. I might not if I read the comic book. Which I won't.
@aj_macready Cosigned. As good as a feature-length Watchmen movie can possibly be.
Infinitely more exited about The Killing Joke movie than any Bats or Supes films by Zack Snyder. Watchmen was great, but since then... #SDCC
@JerryBreseno I think that's snyder's style reminds me of Watchmen a lot which is the only movie he did right,
Zack Snyder will probably ruin the Batman vs Superman movie, just like he ruined Watchmen and Man of Steel, but I hope he proves me wrong
@TacticalJunkJet meant that about how Snyder somehow directed the previous Superman movie. Wasn't a problem with Watchmen for example.
@scottEweinberg Watchmen was great movie... Also liked 300
@TJHawke411 @tholzerman Yeah, and whenever I re-read Watchmen, I don't even think of the movie. (The drunkenness maybe helped.)
@LOLPhillies @tholzerman it was as good as a watchmen movie could ever be
I would take the batman trilogy, watchmen, and V for Vendetta over any marvel movie besides guardians and captain America 2
@FlightLifeMars Watchmen is still my favorite from him, that movie is so underrated. Probably one of the best comic based movies out there.
The movie could stick suck hard, both Watchmen and Man of Steel trailers were great, but the films were mediocre.
"It's everything you loved from the Watchmen movie! Wait, you didn't love the Watchmen movie?"
MY TAKE ON ZACK SNYDER I kinda liked the Watchmen movie
@lastlivingrose @liamsetto its bad but not bc watchmen is a super precious gemstone its bad bc its a bad movie by zack snyder
Remember the watchmen movie my peeps. Remember it
will zack snyder make a better movie than watchmen??
@rockiesVSconnor Exactly. All this buzz makes me think of the Watchmen movie a while ago.
Looks a lot like Watchmen. Zack Snyder's style scares me. I love Watchmen but this is a different movie Zack!
This is movie looks too much like #Watchmen and that is a good thing https://youtu.be/0WWzgGyAH6Y

also let the record show i am not hyped or caring about this movie at all, i just loved the watchmen
#BatmanvSuperman just topped #watchmen to be the greatest movie of all time
I'm tired of Zack Snyder stay having these slow motion shots in his movie. Hope this movie isn't full of them like The Watchmen was

watched Watchmen with Evan, it's 3:00 and I'm still awake and if you asked me what that movie is about I wouldn't be able to tell you #tired
I wonder what the overlap is between people who were pissed they made Watchmen into a movie and people excited for The Killing Joke movie

So this is a movie that takes place in an alternate 1985 w/ technology from 1995. Wait ... what? #watchmen
The hetero-lifemate has never seen Watchmen. She never read the comics, either, but that's not her thing so I'll let that go. Movie night!
Again: no one ages appropriately on this movie except The Comedian. Even in Dr Manhattan's flashback. #watchmen
Gah. This movie leaves out so many essential details ... So many points that actually make the book interesting. #watchmen
Is Matthew Goode in any other movie besides watchmen that was actually good? Besides his five second cameo in Belle
Found a cheap blu-ray copy of “Watchmen.” Good transfer, underrated movie. Snyder stepped up, put the book on film.

Watchmen was actually a pret cool movie
Kinda wanna read Watchmen now. I wonder if it's consistent with the movie on the view of flawed morality in light of man's depravity.
Forgot how dark of a movie Watchmen was
@DarkWolfized iunno. And I STILL haven't seen the Watchmen movie. I really need to get on that.
@QueenCasbug what doi you think the movie was based on? it was made by the same guy who did Watchmen

Rainy night movie line up this far, watchmen, and now finishing up sling blade. . . Suggestions on what I should close out with are welcome
@beatrixfuriosa It's sad that that is what I took away from that movie. Watchmen was supposed to be more than that.
Watchmen might not be my favorite superhero (antihero technically) movie, but I think it is by far the best overall!
Watchmen is easily the worst movie I've ever seen
Watchmen is such a dope movie cause it illustrates superheroes as normal people having normal issues
The Watchmen was a horrible movie.

The watchmen movie was before its time it set the standard of what could be done in hero movies
I feel as though Watchmen is such an underrated comic book movie.
I wish the Watchmen movie wasn't as trash as it is. Cause I love the comic.
I still don't get the movie Watchmen. Visually its amazing! But i still don't get what its about
Watchmen was a good ass movie.

99 red balloons is in the movie watchmen and I love it
Rorschach and that fuckboy villain were my faves in Watchmen. The movie.
Watchmen is THEEE longest movie. Only made it all the way through once :/
Never understood the watchmen movie, maybe I shoulda read the comics first
tbh if they made a watchmen movie in the 80s Danny Elfman would've been a perfect choice for rorschach

Watchmen is such a damn good movie. So good.
Remark: if there was an 8-hour long Watchmen movie available, I would watch it.
For a movie that was made way back in 2009, The Watchmen still looks as fresh as dope. Like its a 2015 movie
The best cinematography I've ever seen is from Watchmen. The colors for this movie looks so bad ass.
Zack Snyder's best movie is Watchmen. Let's see if BvS will beat that.
Watchmen on #scifi network ... A real comic movie, the last 15 mns, cold reality, love Dr. Manhattan's dialogue.. #writing #Film #script

It's probably sacrilege but the movie version of Watchmen has some really great parts (although it's all Alan Moore).
Watching the movie watchmen with commercial breaks should not be allowed
The WATCHMEN movie is somehow both better and worse than people say

Watchmen is such a good movie
No one can ever say #Watchmen the movie does not capture the essentials of the graphic novel or the characters, given the limits of film
Watchmen is such an underrated movie. It's better than most recent marvel movies so...

Watching #Watchmen on SyFy. More commercials than movie, and entire scenes are shortened because of the content. Honestly why even show it?

Oh thing about the Watchmen I couldn't fuck with was all the excessive shots of blue sausage they had in the movie.

@ComicBook_Movie Not exactly. He was coming at it from the point of view of Watchmen, where being a crime fighter means violence.
Never forget: the movie scripts for Watchmen and the first X-Men movie were written by Solid Snake.
Overwhelming urge to see Watchmen cause Bob Dylan was singing 'The Times they are a-Changing' at the theatre. Also Max is an epic movie!
The Watchmen opening credits are still the greatest opening credits for any movie ever.
watchmen such a good movie
Feel like watching Watchmen, I need to get that movie.
I know they weren't trendy at the time, but I think the Watchmen movie could have used an after-credits scene.
It's still a crime that in the Watchmen movie Dr Manhattan stole Laurie's thunder regarding her patriarchal parentage; poor choice, there.
I'll be perfectly happy then remember the Watchmen movie and suddenly become furious at the world
I'm watching the Watchmen (movie, heh.); always kind of disappointed in the short shrifting that Rorschach's prison psychiatrist gets here.
Watchmen was such a weird movie but only because it gave us the answer to "who watches the Watchmen?" its us we're watching the Watchmen

I tried watching the movie The Watchmen when it came out. Not sure if it's over yet.
I don't get how people can say The Avengers is the best comic book movie when movies like Watchmen exist.
I should rewatch Watchmen. Maybe Jamie will want to. Another 2 hr 48 min movie to put her through!
#watchmen everytime I see this movie I love it more and more. Funny, cause the first time, I hated it
I've seen Watchmen three times and I still don't understand what that movie was about
Watchmen could've been a better movie
Watchmen seems like it's a good movie, I'm going to have to remember that the next time it comes on.
Rewatching "The Watchmen" still hate it. Movie had so much potential but the terrible acting ruined it for me
Watchmen is an amazing movie
@watchmen is such an underrated movie.
I forgot how good a movie Watchmen is

But shortly after starting it, the movie was announced. A movie art book w/ new Watchmen concept art came out. After Watchmen happened.
@mzlhisyam movie bakal keluar antman ,suicide squad,deadpool. Kalau yg lama watchmen ah..watchmen best gak.
This is coming from a guy who has watched this movie almost as much as the watchmen
Ben Affleck directed BATMAN > Zack Snyder directed one THE TOWN feels more Batman than 300, WATCHMEN, MAN OF STEEL....
Watchmen movie is so long, my attention was derailed an hour ago.
Great movie everytime. Never gets old #Watchmen #MyFav
@500DaysOfFilm That's crazy. I haven't walked out of a movie since Watchmen and I just walked the Entourage movie. (Terrible by the way)

Watchmen might be the only movie that I just can't decide if I love or hate.
Dude unbreakable is probably the most intense Super hero movie. It's so artsy tonthe level of Watchmen really .
smh guardian of the galaxy still so overrated for me its just a basic superhero movie. really... nothing compares to watchmen
@rainbowrowell Is the movie version of Watchmen any good?
#nw The Incredibles. Am I the only one who thinks this movie mirrors the plot of Watchmen?
@Da_Nerdette I was reading that list and going yeah... Because the last comic book movie that had sex was Watchmen, the one kids totally saw
watchmen is great movie btw pic.twitter.com/ukWDrblN3F
@kentofhearts I'd say Watchmen comic > MM > Sin City comics > Watchmen movie > Sin City movie

@LynchReborn @NBCHannibal Also ratings must mean that a show is great. Watchmen is a amazing movie but not a whole lot of people saw it.

@hotdogsladies Watchmen movie stigma!? Try having enjoyed the Ang Lee Hulk… :/
Watchmen was a good movie I'm still fucked up over Rorschach
@TheReelAnderson says the best guy in the Watchmen movie!
While dc bust a nut making movies, watchmen madmax batman darknight returns. I compare every shithole marvel movie to the green lantern.
Watching Watchmen & it's still a very good adaptation of the comic but the ending lets the movie down due to realities of a cold war setting

Watchmen still a dope ass movie
4 years ago today, I watched Watchmen for the first time. After that, it was my favorite movie for a while.
the guy who played Rorschach in the Watchmen movie should play The Question in the #DCCU
Watchmen Cool movie Rubbish and imbecillic ending
@heythisisbrian I'm betting more people who worked on Before Watchmen saw the movie and didn't read the book
I wonder if more people saw the Watchmen movie than ever read the book.
