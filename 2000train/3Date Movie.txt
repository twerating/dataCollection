I'm not surprised the Steve Jobs movie did poorly at the box office. Its not a date movie, not is it overly oscar driven.
Treating myself maybe to my own personal ounce of dank ass pineapple and maybe a dinner date movie
I'm not sure Gaspar Noe's Love is a great first date movie but it's even more awkward watching it with a bunch of mostly male film critics.
I don't know what any of y'all are talking about. The Big Chill isn't even available on Netflix! Also, not a great date movie.
So @JoshMacuga @5150ellis said to ask about a Muppet date movie story???

But Henry omg why would you suggest watching Harold and Maude and say it's a goOD DATE MOVIE-- GET OUT
"Harold and Maude" is the weirdest date movie ever. Ha ha ha
Did Henry just suggest Harold and Maude as a date movie? #OUAT you are insane.
Can we go back to the fact that Henry thought Harold and Maude was a date movie lmao. #OnceUponATime

Of course our date movie was sold out at two places :'(
@RussellHFilm There are some other good movies out right now as well, but I think Self/less has all the components of a good date movie :)

@fldlxnc I was just thinking about how it was my best first date movie choice ever
Ant Man mooted as possible date movie but boredom won over romance. Then home for champagne and tears. And beef brisket noodles.
Tried to take myself on a date...movie is sold out. I guess @HeissKyle is the only one who can pull off a date with me cause that was bad.

Ran out of shit on Netflix so watching the shit of all shit. 'Date movie' god awful
I'm not trying to overhype"Trainwreck" at all. Just giving you guys a mini-review. Like I said I'd give it a strong B+ &a PERFECT date movie
It's also a perfect date movie(if your girl is cool). Plenty of raunchy humor but also some great dramatic moments. #Trainwreck

By date movie I mean playing the movie in the background while you make out because you know you're not missing much.
I liked beyond the lights, but it wasn't anything new or groundbreaking. It wasn't bad, just a little cheesy haha. Perfect date movie.

They Came Together is a genuinely funny parody of modern romantic comedies in a way that Date Movie isn't. Nails the tropes of the genre.
