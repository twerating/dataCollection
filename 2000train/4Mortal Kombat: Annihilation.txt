“ @Rudie_Obias: MORTAL KOMBAT: THE MOVIE... might be the worst movie made in the last 20 years.” Have you seen MORTAL KOMBAT ANNIHILATION?!
The only things that make Street Fighter a better movie than Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is Kylie Minogue, Raul Julia, and Ming Na.
Did not know whether to play a game or to watch a movie so now i am watching Mortal Kombat Annihilation.
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997) is such a bad movie that you can't even enjoy its stupidity with a group of friends.
@pigeonhater1 yes, it is! It's from Mortal Kombat Annihilation, the 1st MK Movie
Okay, now I want to watch Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. I love this movie! ;)
Up now: Mortal Kombat: The Movie. On deck: Mortal Kombat: Annihilation
Dinner and a movie. The movie being Mortal Kombat Annihilation, the dinner being BBQ chicken, broccoli and cheesy potatoes.
The first Mortal Kombat movie was pretty terrible, but Mortal Kombat Annihilation is just downright bad.
Just watched Mortal Kombat The Movie since its available on Netflix online. Now I just want them to do that with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation
Mortal Kombat Annihilation, why do I even have this movie?
Mortal Kombat Rebirth> Mortal Kombat Legacy > Mortal Kombat 1st movie > Mortal Kombat Annihilation.
Mortal Kombat Annihilation, why couldn't you have been a better movie? Damnit.
