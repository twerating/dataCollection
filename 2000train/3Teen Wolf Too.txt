teen wolf too is great bc its basically the same movie but he boxes now? who would box a werewolf? how do i get these 2 hours back?
Just a friendly reminder that Teen Wolf Too is a legitimately awful movie. Jason Bateman and Gomez Addams deserved better.
Teen Wolf Too may be the most 80's movie of all 80's
Rainy day movie chosen by the 8 year-old is Teen Wolf Too. I was right to never have seen it.
"Teen Wolf Too" (1987) is an inferior movie (F) #DallasCritic <nwhiid>

Well there's a movie called Teen Wolf, and there's a sequel called Teen Wolf Too. So, yeah.
"Teen Wolf Too" is also what I write into presidential ballots, mainly because I forgot the name of that movie's star.

And while I'm at it, why do the shirts that Stiles sells, in movie, say 'Teen Wolf Too'? Makes ZERO sense.
While the entire movie Teen Wolf Too is awful, the impromptu song and dance routine is one of the most cringe inducing scenes ever.
It's an awful movie but somehow I'm sucked into Teen Wolf Too

Does anyone else remember that Jason Bateman's first movie was Teen Wolf Too? How did we allow his career to go anywhere after that?

Teen Wolf - Great movie. Teen Wolf Too - Not.
Oh wait I saw more than ten minutes of "Teen Wolf Too" it's actually a terrible movie
If you look past the awful special effects, the synth score and baby faced Jason Bateman makes "Teen Wolf Too" a great movie.

Teen Wolf Too is on Go! What a crap movie. Possibly one of the worst sequels in the history of film. Following a bad 1st movie doesn't help.
Mr.J insists upon watching Teen Wolf Too this evening....and I have to suffer through it after hiring a shit movie last night #payback
Horrible Bosses was a delight. Jason Bateman hasn't made a movie I haven't enjoyed... besides Teen Wolf Too.
Unlike the first movie, Teen Wolf Too is badly written and painful to watch. Still, I love its lighthearted treatment of lycanthropy.
Teen wolf too is on. Never saw it until now. It gets my vote for WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! probably worse than that spice girls movie.
How did 'Teen Wolf Too' manage to make a movie about a werewolf boxer in college SO boring?

Accidental @batemanjason movie marathon this week: Couples Retreat, Up In The Air...might as well rent Teen Wolf Too. #werewolvesb4twilight

If you want a good movie about a person turning into a wolf stick with either the original THE WOLFMAN from 1941, or TEEN WOLF TOO.

Teen wolf too on tv, thankfully Jason bateman went on to bigger and better things. This movie is a turd.
Teen Wolf Too. Not as good as Teen Wolf but a young Jason Bateman is a good enough reason to watch. In the mood for Monster Squad now #movie
Wish they still made movie sequels with "too" in the titles. Like "Teen Wolf Too", or "Look Who's Talking Too".
I just saw the scariest movie..it was terrible..it's call Teen Wolf Too
watching Teen Wolf Too jaja l love this movie as cheesey as it is i love it
Teen Wolf Too is seriously the exact same movie as the first one except he's in college instead of HS & does boxing instead of basketball.
@colleenaf Stiles in Teen Wolf was so cool. He was a hero of mine. Stiles in Teen Wolf Too was a movie-ruiningly lame.
Teen wolf too, as in this movie shall rock too!
Teen Wolf Too is on right now. That may be the worst sequel of any movie ever.
There has been good, bad, great and awful movie titles over the years, but none can touch "Teen Wolf Too" Teen Wolf...AS WELL! Brilliant!
ahhh, the best holiday movie: teen wolf too staring a young, dapper jason bateman
@christopher575 I saw Teen Wolf Too in the movie theaters. I don't think I remember any of it, except it involved boxing? Maybe?
@SwtBabybluez I'd have been happier saying that I watched Teen Wolf Too or the Garbage Pail Kids Movie.

Third 80's movie I've seen this week with the song "send me an angel". Rad, Teen Wolf Too, The Wizard. Are there more??
TEEN WOLF TOO (w/ Jason Bateman) is playing on THiS-TV. Ah, the days when movie bullies were easily ID-ed by their custom license plates.

Why Was The Movie Teen Wolf Too Made? http://ff.im/8bB2s
I just saw a news story on IMDB that referred to Jason Bateman as the star of Teen Wolf Too. He's typecast for that movie?

@shelley1005 It was a fun movie. NOw if you said you were watching Teen Wolf Too(had to google to find title) I might start to worry ;-)
@KrystalSim the Jack Nicholson starring 'Wolf' - the worst werewolf movie ever - even worse than Teen Wolf Too
just watched teen wolf too with jp. why this movie didn't win an oscar is beyond me.
Just watched Teen Wolf! Great movie! Did you know there is a Teen Wolf Too? Starring Jason Bateman? Wow!
"Teen Wolf Too" starring 1987 Jason Bateman? How did I NOT know about this? Netflix queue, you have your orders. Bring me this movie!
Teen Wolf Too is a horrible, horrible movie. You're better than that, Bateman. Arrested Development, man!
Okay, now I know why I never saw teen wolf too...I never knew this movie was so horrible.
Well, im awake. Insomnia sucks. Also, Teen Wolf Too is a pretty bad movie
Who the hell knew that they made a "Teen Wolf Too" movie... Its on TBS right now & this movie is complete SHIT compared to the original
Just finished watching The Patriot w/ my roomie...It was actually good! Now im either gonna watch Teen Wolf Too (80s movie) or Miami Social
Teen Wolf Too is a horribly written movie. It's even worse trying to draw while it's on. Just a couple more hours to go on this thing
Gremlins 2 was one of the worst sequels of a very good movie..others; Ghostbusters 2, Caddyshack 2, Teen Wolf Too, Matrix 2, more?
@toojiggy Teen Wolf was grrrreat but Teen Wolf Too blowed... and I love Jason Bateman, but refuse to ever watch that movie again! I heart U
http://twitpic.com/9v6n5 - Have you seen Teen Wolf Too? If that movie wasn't a crime, I don't know what is!
I would see this movie RT @nerdist: Teen Wolf Too 2 #unnecessarysequels #trackle
@kevinwchat Teen Wolf definitely helped, even though the movie is approximately 50% montages. Teen Wolf Too didn't get assigned as homework.
Had a dream involving the movie Teen Wolf Too last night. Also, Specter's defection + Franken winning = Limbaugh's head exploding. CLOTURE.
So many better movies choices than Teen Wolf too...like Anchorman or Hostel I/II or any Saw movie really
Watchin Teen Wolf Too! Ha ha Remember that movie!
"Teen Wolf" was a good movie... But! Jason Bateman in "Teen Wolf Too"?? THAT movie changed my life. Period!
Jason Bateman in Teen Wolf Too. Incredibly bad movie, but then again so was the first. Classic 80's.
"teen wolf too" is perhaps the worst movie i've ever seen. Really disappointed.
Teen Wolf Too a.k.a. Jason Bateman fucked everyone in this movie
saw the best movie for the second time in my life...TEEN WOLF TOO. why? well i dont know. the special f/x? riviting.
Worst movie sequel after a good first movie: Teen Wolf Too or Cadyshack 2?
"Teen wolf too" is officially the worst movie EVAR
Just watched Handcock. Unrelated: Hey, you guys remember that awesome movie, 'Teen Wolf Too'?
Am now watching the end of Teen Wolf Too. It truly is the best movie day ever.
today's 80's movie is Teen Wolf Too!
I made it about halfway through Teen Wolf Too and turned it off. Rarely is a movie so bad I can't make it through.
I would say "teen wolf" is the worst movie I own but "teen wolf too" is on the flip side of this DVD.
@mimobot You're right! Just look at "Teen Wolf Too" or "Weekend at Bernie's II". Movie-making at its finest!
A "Teen Wolf" remake? One reason that's a bad idea: "Teen Wolf Too". Can't someone throw some movie money at a somewhat orignal idea?
