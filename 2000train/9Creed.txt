Just saw Creed for 2nd time. Hats off to my guy @michaelb4jordan, that movie gives me all sorts of feels as huge fan of originals
Are we just not going to talk about how Adonis Creed spends most of the movie using the name "Don Johnson"
Creed movie was dope
Check out the #Creed Movie #Auctions at http://www.creedauctions.com  pic.twitter.com/kJ9dZEpgEd
In my opinion Southpaw was a better movie than Creed
Creed was a great movie. Wow.
CREED boxed $79M in 19 days! 31% ahead of the $60.64M 19-day gross of the original Rocky Balboa movie. pic.twitter.com/z3vJvI7kGd
Wife, being forced to see #Creed: "Man, I have zero interest in this movie." *we see it* Wife: "I am so glad I insisted we see this movie."
sooo I'm pretty sure I'm the only one that still hasn't seen the movie Creed.
Took my daughter @aleeyadavanzo to watch #Creed last night..I love that movie @TheSlyStallone is a genius n @michaelb4jordan was perfect.

Saw creed in a theater because I was too young to watch Rocky in one great movie I had several chill moments #CREED https://twitter.com/TheSlyStallone/status/674625649789681664 …
CREED is definitely my fave movie of the year! Definitely hit home for me. Loved the acting, the music and especially the heart of the film.
Creed was a good ass movie but I still think Southpaw was better
@wolfwiles Unless they didn't like the movie #CREED then I'm judging the hell out of them
Confession: I've been confusing Creed with Carol and was all "I'll never see a boxing movie no matter how many lesbians are in it." #oops

I know it wasn't a positive thing but I would watch a whole movie of Adonis punching disrespectful rappers. #creed
I think I'd be more interested in seeing the movie Creed if it was about the BAND Creed. Which is to say I don't want to see it AT ALL.
Saw Creed last night..awesome movie..glad the Rocky legacy lives on #CREED #SLY #Boxing

I feel like more could have been done with Bianca in the movie Creed. She had a lot of potential as a really cool character.
I wanna see the movie Creed and Point Break
So I didn't get to see the whole creed movie bc someone wants to talk the whole time lol
Creed was a fantastic movie @Karthikboii @sakti_saraan
Watched creed last night so good. Now i want to re watch every rocky movie. #biengewatch.
Saw creed , no bullshhit it's a very good movie but I did expect a lil more out of it but still over a good movie
Creed looks like a really good movie
that confusion (and the fact that I've never seen a ROCKY movie) aside, CREED is maybe my favorite movie of the year. it's so so good.
Sylvester Stallone better win best supporting actor for #Creed that movie was badass!
Biggest #GoldenGlobes snubs on the movie side of thing for me: Creed, Michael B. Jordan, Sicario (Benicio, too) + Brooklyn.
Creed & Straight Outta Compton has no cast or movie nominations for a Golden Globe but Sylvester Stallone does. Hmm, a white guy of course
@MagicMarkee @michaelb4jordan Ugh, I don't want to hear that. Creed was the best movie I've seen in years.
@KeleMosley Nah you right that movie was lit and the acting was really good. Let me know how u liked Creed tho

CREED GREAT movie!!!
i just found out that michael fassbender is going to be in the assassin's creed movie hooooo my god i need an inhaler
Having never seen a Rocky movie I thought that "Creed" was something about the band you hear on dentist-office radio
#GoldenGlobes: Let's give Stallone the nomination! he was great in Creed. Us: What about the rest of the movie? GG: pic.twitter.com/3aCnF0n3LN
Seeing this makes me wonder if Creed will be better than the best Rocky movie (Rocky IV) http://thebiglead.com/2015/12/10/michael-b-jordan-knocked-out-creed/ … pic.twitter.com/7BlA7K28wC

Btw, creed was a great movie. Had my attention all throughout
So Sylvester Stallone gets a nomination but Michael B Jordan and the movie Creed don't? no sense.
This movie Creed got me so hype. Mornings like this I throw on my sweats and run around the corner to get my coffee. Cuz I'm not that dude.
One step, one punch, one round at a time. Creed was a good movie!
#Creed was still the best movie this year.
Saw Creed last night. Very good movie. Highly recommended.
I liked a @YouTube video from @screenslam http://youtu.be/-FR2zH9EXn4?a  Creed: Sylvester Stallone "Rocky Balboa" Official Movie Interview
How do you nominate Sylvester Stallone for a Golden Globe for Creed but not Michael B. Jordan nor the movie itself?
Thi girl in the the creed movie is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen before
Where the fuck is Magic Mike XXL? Creed? Diversity in movie actresses? We just don't know.
"CREED" movie? It was brilliant! real deal
OK that Stallone got nominated for CREED. But the movie belongs to Michael B. Jordan, who deserved a spot for lead actor. #GoldenGlobes
Congratulations @TheSlyStallone on your @goldenglobes nomination for #Creed!! Most definitely my favorite movie this year!!! #Rocky

#Creed is probably my favorite movie so far in 2015. Seriously, if something this year was better, I probably missed it
Creed is a dope movie and they nailed the soundtrack.

Wow. The single take (but not really) steady cam shot during the first match in #Creed is stellar. Never seen that in a boxing movie before.
"Creed" is the best movie I've seen in 2015 and I find it hard to believe anything will top it. See it.

i was so disappointed that the #1 fighter in the world in the movie creed looked like he forgot to workout before filming began.
I didn't know Michael B. Jordan got knocked out for real making "Creed". Bless his heart. Incredible movie I must add.
Just saw creed what a motivational movie.
creed is a good ass movie , made me want to start boxing and shit
Definitely should have the Creed movie soundtrack as my workout music
If you haven’t seen #CREED yet just die. Best movie I’ve seen since #LionKing #ColorPurple and #Notebook. It taps the Human Spirit real hard
CREED may have had the prettiest fight scenes I've ever seen in a movie. In no way boxing, but really pretty movie fighting
Creed is the movie to see! If you you think the Rocky movies were wait til u see Creed
I just wanted to see a movie that was gonna surprise me since someone wanted to tell me the ending of creed
Creed was a great movie. I definitely recommend it.
Creed wasn't that good of a movie
Creed was sooooooooo good!!!!!!! @michaelb4jordan I'm so proud!!!! You did an amazing job, loved every minute of the movie
Creed was an excellent movie, and I think that detail makes it even better. Like holy crap.
Creed was such a solid movie
@HeraclesPJ hahaha me too! Let's go watch a movie! The last movie me and Ana watched was hunger games. I wanna watch creed!
I'm still mad at the movie creed that they told us the long time mystery ending to Rocky 3. I didn't want to know.
Just saw a few pics of Michael Fassbender on set for the Assassins Creed movie. Don't care if it's crap, I'm throwing money at it.

Creed was an excellent movie. @michaelb4jordan was phenomenal.
Literally thought the movie Creed was about the band Creed and I just saw the trailer on TV and almost fell out of my chair
I should have went to see creed instead of chiraq. I swear it seemed like Dr. Seuss wrote that movie

#Creed is actually a pretty damn good boxing movie. And with a fictional Black protagonist for once. That's...oddly rare.
Storyline was a bit of a layup vs a slam dunk, but still a dope movie overall. Could see myself watching it over again. #Creed

Finally saw creed. Its better than a mayweather fight! But seriously, great movie. Go see it! https://www.swarmapp.com/c/koXeiA510gM 
As sad as this is whenever someone mentions the movie creed I honestly initially think of the band who sings that "with arms wide open" song
the girl in the movie creed said "females" and "keep it 100" and a lot of other things that i wasn't aware people actually said in real life
New favourite movie award goes to... Creed

Creed is excellent. Feels like a Rocky movie, but also like it's own thing. Plus Michael B. Jordan is incredible #CREED
Creed was maybe the best movie I've seen in 5 years. If anyone is on the fence, you need to go
Creed is an unbelievable movie. Wouldn't be surprised to see it run away with best picture this year
I wish they would put creed on my movie website so I can watch it again
The movie Creed is pretty damn good

I've been real into law and order lately. Michael B. Jordan from the new movie creed is on an episode as a boxer in 2010. Pretty cool

Creed movie was so amazing!!!!!!
Can't decide if I should go see Creed or Spotlight. Also my first movie theater experience alone and I'm kind of excited about it
"Creed" is that movie rarity - BOTH critically and audience acclaimed. It should absolutely be in the awards race. Thassit.
Creed is the best movie i have seen this year! Go see it, you won't be dissapointed. Excellent acting, some good laughs, hard hitting fights

Creed is far more of a Rocky movie than I anticipated, and in that respect the lack of embarrassing choices in it is flat out incredible.

MOVIE REVIEW: Creed http://bit.ly/21LQbWa  pic.twitter.com/4021mUxw1h
#Creed was an amazing movie. Has the #Rocky feel to it but still it's own movie. #Stallone needs at least an #Oscar nomination for sure.
Creed is a pretty decent movie.

Creed was fantastic. But if Stallone doesn't get a supporting actor Oscar nod I'll never watch another movie again.
even though i didn't love the movie, the projector scene in Creed really worked well, despite the heavy-handed nature. hasn't left my head.

I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/2eIZxNHjOqM?a  Assassin's Creed: Movie - Set Images (Fassbender in robes)

#Creed, in my book, is a great movie in how it took all the best elements of the series and concentrated them into one piece of filmmaking.
Just saw Creed. Liked the movie. But I was amazed by Sly Stallone's performance. It 100% did not suck.

Creed was such a good movie
Couple years ago if a movie had a part 7 it meant it was horrendous but now this year we've gotten Fast & Furious 7 and Creed that were good
You 2 did a great job on this movie @michaelb4jordan @TheSlyStallone #Creed

When Adonis Creed came out for the last fight might be my favorite movie scene ever.
Creed was a great movie. MBJ is a good actor. In a couple of years he might be on the path of greatness. Representing Newark NJ very well.
@ShaniPotatoHead Somebody said you snapped the whole creed movie
I love movie recommendations, that being said, if you get the chance, check out "Creed". Wasn't expecting much, came out surprised. 8/10.

"Creed" is one sport movie without the necessary cliche. Setting in Philly, the final scene in lieu of 'Rocky', is awesome. #recomended

I thought creed was a great movie
The movie Creed had me so HYPE
But what I really want is a sequel to Creed, which might be the best movie I saw this year. Just keep Rocky in it!
@MAM_Podcast makes no sense, saw creed as number 1 movie of the year by a news outlet lol. Looking forward to your pod on top ten best/worst
Creed was such a good movie
Just watched creed. Great movie.
Creed was a dope ass movie
Watched for the 2nd time tonight with my rider. Love this movie! — watching Creed at Regal Hollywood Stadium 20... http://fb.me/6QsMsSSW6 
Now watching "Fruitvale Station" and it's crazy how much smaller Michael B. Jordan is in this movie vs Creed
Creed looks like such a sick movie!
Creed is a freaking great movie.

Creed probably the best movie I've seen in a while
CREED IS THE BEST MOVIE OF 2015.
Creed was bad ass movie
creed was such a great movie
Rocky Creed hands down best movie Iv seen this year
The boy from creed not cute to me I just like his attitude in the movie
Y'all ain't tell me Creed was messing with Jhene AikNO in the movie tho I was BIG MAD
Creed was such a great movie, but nothin beats the classics
Creed was a fantastic movie. Acting was phenomenal and the intensity of the last hour or so was something I havent felt in a long time.
Creed is literally the best movie ever, can someone please tell me why that Michael B Jordan is so fine
New Rocky movie, "Creed" is good, worth seeing.
Bring all your minion/creed movie fan fiction mash ups to me, plz. I want to read them/expand on your ideas.
Just watched that movie Creed. It was great. It's like they took that movie Rocky, and then... continued in that fashion identically.

Best part of the movie #creed is when Michael b Jordan is taken down his girl twists #blacklove
Creed is such a bad ass movie
Creed is a very good movie and I've never seen many of the Rocky movies
the movie Creed was so good
We went to see Creed yesterday it's a good movie
Went to #Creed tonight and I have to say it is a great movie.. Best rocky movie since the original rocky!
creed is a really good movie. i recommend it
Ended my Rocky marathon with Creed. Epic movie that captures the essence of the first. #Creed #Rockybalboa #cinema #Boxing
Freaking great movie #CREED
Creed was such a good movie
@ManaByte Creed was a great movie. In my opinion
I love when a movie gets a theatre audience applauding. That's just what @creedmovie did @michaelb4jordan & Ryan Coogler did it again #CREED
The movie "Creed" is official. Definitely motivating too. Now Im abt to hit the gym.

Creed was a really good movie,definitely recommend it. 9/10- all it was missing was a Meek Mill appearance,lol.
creed > rocco and his brothers, 4K can only fix so much of what's wrong w/ a movie
Just saw Creed... not the band, the movie.
15. I'm 45 minutes into the movie and love that I've only seen 30 seconds of actual live real fight scenes. #Creed
12. Rocky reading the newspaper to Adrian and Paulie's grave is not the best part of this movie so far. #Creed
Just saw Creed. That movie is the truth
Showy, less thoughtful soundtracks get more press, but Creed used music better than any movie I've seen this year
Do yourselves a favor & go see #Creed the movie, NOT the band. It holds it's own and is on par with Rocky 1 & 2. Very impressed.
If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend going to see the movie "Creed" while its in theaters!
If you think creed was bad you obviously aren't a meek mill fan and obviously have no love for a classic pump up movie. 12th round a classic
I don’t know about Creed the movie, but Creed the band was really enjoyable. I refuse to apologize for digging them.
Damn CREED is a really good but sad movie
Creed is a great movie
Creed - 7.7 Great movie, very inspirational / motivating. Feel like this is the modern version of legends of old of heroes/gladiators/battle
Creed is an awesome movie. After these finals Im watching Rocky all weekend long. #addicted
Dawg, did i tell y'all i finally got the chance to watch the movie #CREED over the weekend. Very inspiring - for a go getter like myself!
Creed was such a good movie I wouldn't mind seeing it again
almost just ended a friendship when my friend asked me to come see Creed and i thought she was talking about the band not the movie
First movie date since 2013 is on Friday. Twitter, what should we see? (Might ultimately ignore any/all suggestions and just see Creed).
#Creed was so damn good! Plus that 21+ movie theater at the Liberty Mall is so clutch.
Just saw Creed. Pretty good and solid movie. Now I want to play as Little Mac. (jk... but actually...)
I'm watching that new movie " Creed " on my macbook. I love boxing movies. It makes me want to go into my boxing gym and do some damage
I've already seen the full movie in theaters twice but I still get chills watching the first "Creed" trailer
I went to see Creed today. Good movie. I predict he'll fight Drago's son in Creed II.

Finally watched Creed & I was not disappointed. It was such a good movie!
@mattandkim you guys were on electric factory's billboard in the movie Creed !
I got a two hour window after i hit this J to go see #creed today before one of these idiots get to tweeting bout the movie or naw
@JoshAppel First time I heard they were making a movie about "Creed", I assumed that they were referring to the band.
I honestly cannot get over how great Creed was. I wanna go see that movie again.
Creed is a good ass movie
Creed was a great movie but I could do without the people in the theater yelling and cheering during the fight. #ItsNotReal #TheyDontHearYou
Creed is a study in Athleisure. Super dope movie. Hope MBJ gets the critical acclaim and becomes the next black star for our generation.
Not gonna lie. Creed is movie of the year. Seriously good
"Creed" is such a dope movie, y'all. Definitely go see it.
Creed was a great movie, one of the best I've seen all year. #FightTillTheLastBreath

Excellent Movie! #creed https://www.instagram.com/p/_A7B2ntkhM/ 
The one-take fight in CREED was apparently a legitimate one-take that they did twelve times. The one in the movie is the tenth take.
Creed made me want 2 go home n watch the Wire again.. That n seeing Mack Wilds @ every Art Basel party.. Great Movie!!
but whatever, in other news, Creed is the coolest movie ever
Gotta see the movie creed
The movie creed is soo intense
I gotta remember there's a "Creed" movie. Keep thinking people are all amped after seeing Scott Stapp and crew totally crush it onstage.
My Dad and I are going to see the movie Creed right now and I'm pumped! I can barely remember the last time I saw a movie in theaters!
I just want to watch creed or the new James Bond movie
I think everyone who is raving about the Creed movie should add a disclaimer that they aren't talking about Creed the band. They're terrible
Every time I see someone tweet about Creed I think they're talking about the band not the movie
#Creed movie was pretty good. Added bonus; it's also a 2 hour video catalogue of Nike/Jordan products. The swoosh is in every scene!
@hotlinebling @BriMalandro but CREED has like no campaign and neither does the Steve Jobs movie, it's weird
Really want to go see Creed, that movie looks awesome!
I still really wanna see the movie Creed

@DrewOnTheRadio Mick dies in the 3rd movie. That's why Apollo steps in to train him for his fight with Mr T. Also Creed is FANTASTIC!
i didn't really like creed maybe cause i was high but idk that movie was just boring
Creed was a pretty damn good movie. I haven't decided where to rank it, but definitely in the top three in the Rocky franchise.
@CarriePoppyYES Literally thought it was a movie about Creed and decried humanity's hubris for a good 6 minutes. #HomonyMovies?
Someone go see the movie creed with me. I still haven't seen it

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - In the final scene of the movie "Creed," aging boxer Rocky Balboa stands atop the steps of the Philadelphia
And I keep getting the sense that Creed is not seriously on Academy voters’ radar yet, aside from Stallone. They need to see the movie. Work

Really good movie! — watching Creed at Regal Brandywine Town Center 16 http://fb.me/2Ri9fxwFc 
Just saw Creed. What a great movie.
when i see people mention that new movie Creed i automatically think they're talking about the band..
Too much working = falling behind in my movie watching. Need to see Creed, Spectre, Peanuts movie, and I know there's something else...hmmm
Hands down Creed is the best movie by far.
Standing by my prediction that Creed wins Best Picture Oscar this year, even though Mad Max Fury Road is clearly the best movie of the year
@ElTankeDeFrank @Hathaway_27 @chelstuhhhh yup. Creed is a better boxing movie.
Besides being a great movie, Creed was also one long Nike ad. And I'm totally okay with that.
I'm glad I saw Creed this weekend, but I wish the whole last hour of the movie didn't make me cry.
Someone go see the movie Creed with me this weekend!

Meek Mill is still being tolerated by Nicki Minaj and has his songs all over the best movie to drop this year (Creed). He'll be fine.
Thank you so much @Magic899 for the CREED. We enjoyed it! awesome movie. Hello Ms. @joycepring & @fruitpreserve See U again, hope so.
Creed was a great movie... But Southpaw is still the most underrated movie of the year. Moves your soul as a man
Creed is an excellent deconstruction of the perils of glory-hunting ala Rocky. Such a good movie, I love that it's in the same universe.
I fell asleep on creed last night but I can tell it's a good movie
RT @RetiredFilth: Yes Creed was definitely a better movie than Straight Outta Compton. Like it was excellent so it's not an insult to SOC.
Everyone see CREED. Best all around movie I've seen in 15 years. #inspiring

#Creed was a wicked movie
So I find it funny that Ward had time to make a movie & fight in it but it also resulted in him suing someone even in the movies. #Creed
#Creed movie was not overhyped. Soundtrack is too
So Creed was actually a good movie, k bye.
no no. Creed is not just another boxing movie. It's the story of the challenges this man is facing. The boxing element is just an extra bit,
@PhilJamesson I plan to see that new movie Creed with arms wide open
@997now @fernandoandgreg idk about that xmas movie, i always avoid the commercial trailers but creed, YES
Creed is such a good movie.
The movie is pretty good. I am talking about Creed. It is just exactly like the first Rocky movie. In terms of how it ended.
The movie creed was lit
Creed, better than expected. But still only the 5th best Rocky movie.

"The movie Creed failed to appeal to female love interest" hmmmm probably because it was a boxing movie

Creed was a good movie it's just long
I'm gonna start training for boxing!!!! I'm so excited! I was inspired by the movie Creed! #Creed it's amazing movie!!
