Wait, Pearl Harbor actually happened? I thought Dec. 7th was just the day Americans came together to mourn the fact that that movie exists.
I watched a Pearl Harbor movie today in honor of the terrible event. Kamikaze pilots wore helmets. Morons!!!!
I always thought a good "war" movie would be the story of how the ships were raised and refitted after the Pearl Harbor attack...
In honor of my favorite movie, and the 74 anniversary, I just wanted to recognize the attack on Pearl Harbor. Thank you to all who serve.
Tried to watch the Pearl Harbor movie in remembrance of today

Pearl Harbor Day is about WW2 –not a shitty Ben Affleck movie. I think. If it is, I hope to God there ain’t also a ‘Gigli’ Day.
Since it's December 7, we should all stop and take time to remember that Pearl Harbor was an awful movie #NeverForget
@OU_MBBall watching the movie pearl Harbor before our game tonight. Gotta get the mind right
@AmericasMilHist @GARock945 wasn't this the gentleman portrayed in the movie "Pearl Harbor"? He grabbed that gun & went after the Japs!
@itrevormoore the movie sucked..too bad there's no pearl harbor found footage movies w/some paranormal activity thrown in now that's history
The movie Pearl Harbor is only on at 10, it should be playing all day
& those placed in camps, even right here in WA. US history is glamorized, so #StayWoke (I say this as Pearl Harbor is a fave movie of mine)

@PatriotJewel Play on-demand Pearl Harbor the movie midway was better though
Strong start to the show, Mike attributes Ben Affleck's Pearl Harbor movie as why people should know today is an important anniversary
Mike Francesa suggests that you might know December 7, 1941 is an important day in American history if you've seen the movie "Pearl Harbor"
I think we should all just try to forget Pearl Harbor. I mean, that movie was just awful.
I wish @netflix would add "Pearl Harbor" to the streaming list, at least just for the day. I love that movie.
In remembrance of Pearl Harbor today December 7th I'll watch my favorite movie @BenAffleck
Pearl Harbor movie is crazy bruhhhh
Today is Pearl Harbor so of course I will be watching my favorite movie "we may lose a battle but we can win a war" Dec, 7th 1941
Really want to watch the movie Pearl Harbor in lieu of the fact that it's Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. #PearlHarbor
Why does everyone keep saying Pearl Harbor happened today? That movie was released on May 25th, 2001.
Pearl Harbor is my favorite movie.
In honor of the 74th Anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor I shall watch the movie Pearl Harbor.
Lol the love triangle in Pearl Harbor is something I'm all too familiar with of course the ending is better in the movie but hey

The Pearl Harbor movie from 2001 gets a bad rap because Michale Bay directed it. It's not that bad.
@20committee Hoooold on a second here. Are you saying that the story line(S) in the movie Pearl Harbor wasn't accurate??!
Pearl Harbor will always be my favorite movie of all time
If the movie "Pearl Harbor" had stopped after the attack it would have been ok.
Can't wait for Pearl Harbor to come on. Love that movie
We should all honor and remember #PearlHarbor. And try to forget the terrible Michael Bay movie Pearl Harbor.
Too bad Pearl Harbor has an awful movie portraying the events of that day. Thanks Michael Bay.
In honor of Pearl Harbor, I'm going to pretend the movie Pearl Harbor doesn't exist.
The Pearl Harbor movie i'm watching just started 10 minutes ago and i've been crying for 5

Pearl Harbor is such a bomb ass movie
In remembrance of Pearl Harbor, I'm gonna watch the movie
74 years later and still the most notable thing we've done to honor Pearl Harbor is make a shitty movie
I wish work would let us watch that Pearl Harbor movie with Ben Affleck. It only makes sense, right?
@MonicaStolfa @NinjaPosition_ Cuba Gooding played him in the Pearl Harbor movie.
If you haven't seen the movie Tora, Tora, Tora, then watch it to learn/watch about the events leading up to the Pearl Harbor attacks.
The best & most accurate movie historically about Pearl Harbor is "Tora, Tora, Tora" (1970). A half Japanese/American production. Fantastic
Remembering Pearl Harbor today; will watch my traditional movie at noon, In Harm's Way-John Wayne & other great actors/actresses.
Those looking a great movie on Pearl Harbor, don't watch Michael Bay's 2001 atrocity. Only thing worth seeing in that is Kate Beckinsale.
Watching Pearl Harbor in class and not even 30 minutes into the movie I want to start crying #sadmovies
Dude ! Pearl harbor ain't just a movie
Today we should all take time to remember Pearl Harbor. Not the movie though; no one should ever have to remember that.

Mrs.Merritt:You guys know today is Pearl Harbor Day, right ? Dumbass:Let's not talk about that, that was the saddest movie I've ever seen

Pearl Harbor is now on Foxtel. Another reminder of how versatile Alec Baldwin is... Without him this movie would be a 2/5 instead of a 2.5/5

After Pearl Harbor, next movie by Michael Bay : UsaVSJapan Megan Fox is Carli Lloyd and Shia Laboeuf is all the Japanese. #USAvsJapan
Ironic that the movie Pearl Harbor is on TV right as the World Cup ended and we beat Japan? I think not #merica
This Women's World Cup soccer victory over Japan doesn't make up for Pearl Harbor. That movie was terrible.
Unless they're trying to re-release the movie Pearl Harbor, there is no reason why it should be trending right now.
Dear #Japan- some Americans didn't pay attention in history class- they think Pearl Harbor was a movie. So sorry! #WWC2015 #JPN #USAvJPN

Ironic thing about people making Pearl Harbor jokes tonight probably are thinking of the Ben Affleck movie not the actual event.
I like Pearl Harbor movie and its soundtrack

The #USWNT must have watched the movie Pearl Harbor to hype themselves up right before this match started.
U.S. Team is playing like the watch the movie Pearl Harbor right before the match! #USAvJPN
They must have seen the movie Pearl Harbor before kickoff
Did the USA team watch the movie Pearl Harbor before the game or something? This is just dirty...
Was their Pregame video the movie "Pearl Harbor"? WOW!!!
I've hated Japan ever since I saw the movie Pearl Harbor.
After watching the movie "Pearl Harbor" earlier today, this women's World Cup game feels quite awkward for me #paybacksabitchJapan

In case you don't know, with fireworks now legal in Georgia, it sounds like a Michael Bay movie outside, specifically Pearl Harbor
Pearl Harbor would have been a great movie without the love story.
