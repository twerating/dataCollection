That new movie "Krampus" is about a house full of girls with synced period cycles.
Krampus is the weirdest movie I've ever seen
KRAMPUS WAS THE WEIRDEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN WTH
Krampus wasnt really what i expected at all. I wouldnt really recommend it.(Personally) but Still had a great time at the movie theater. (:
Krampus was the most twisted Christmas movie I've ever seen oh my god
The new Krampus movie looks great pic.twitter.com/4UV3L5fuOh
A movie about your wife's Holiday pms. A horror story. Called Krampus.
Omg I just remembered. When I saw Krampus there was a trailer for a horror movie based on the Aokigahara Forest and it felt really weird.

The movie Krampus should be banned in all 50 states of America. Without a doubt the worst movie to ever show in a theater.
Went with @prestonnyman to see 'Krampus' today. What a crazy movie. Great festive fun. We had a blast.
Krampus was ok. 3 out of 5 queefs. I wanted zombie snowmen, rabies infested reindeers, ribbon dancers, but it was hallmark movie realness.

Like, horror movies are among my least favorite movies, and Xmas movies especially, so Krampus is like a Holy Grail movie.

Krampus looks like a horrible movie.
Krampus looks so dumb, but since it's a Christmas movie I guess I have to see it eventually to say I saw it
Krampus was a really good movie
#Krampus was delightful, best Christmas movie in years.
Krampus was a surprisingly decent movie. Wasn't expecting much from it, ended up getting something watchable. Loved the toys.
Just got back from Krampus and let me tell you, never before have I encountered such a truly amazing movie.

Krampus would of been so much better if they made it a horror movie than a comedy
KRAMPUS WAS THE CORNIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IT WAS AWESOME
If you've read any reviews proclaiming Krampus to be a progeny of Gremlins, take their word for it. It's a fun movie. Deserves to be a hit.
Actual review of Krampus: Imagine Cabin in the Woods and every generic Christmas movie had a terrible, terrible baby.
@KrampusMovie IS THE BEST EVER!! BETTER THEN THE BEST! Go see this movie ASAP! #Krampus
Review of Krampus: Imagine the best movie you can think of. Now imagine it's 10x better. There you go

Krampus: Less Rare Exports, more a Charles Band Demonic Toys with a budget. Not quite Gremlins levels of twisted xmas spirit, but good fun.

I think my favorite aspect of KRAMPUS is that it is a full on Christmas movie, it's not just horror that happens to take place on the 25th

There is something messed up about having a scary Christmas movie, but Krampus couldn't have been any better.
@NekoCase, there wasn't a chance in hell that a Krampus movie would be good, unless it was a kids movie where he learns the meaning of Xmas.

Krampus: You know what makes a horror movie sing? Rules and geography. This movie lacks both. An unfortunate disappointment. #Film2015
On the positive side, I'm glad 'Krampus' is a hit. Original horror movie that's supposed to be good, and Legendary needed a lift.
I really wanna go see that Krampus movie
I am not going to lie…that #Krampus movie freaks me out. A little less freakier than #TheBoy

#Krampus is slow burning movie that never really got going, performances were generally poor only offers a little fun rest was boring, 4/10
That Krampus movie has NOTHING to do with the real Krampus tradition. Krampus has also nothing to do with christmas. Just saying.
It was really fun watching the movie KRAMPUS..to be honest there were som funny parts in there..And som scary parts pic.twitter.com/7xN0n4i5DO

@KrampusMovie Haven't been to movies in years, glad I went for Krampus, a fun movie with a lesson to be learned.
@maddysaurus Are you asking who has seen the movie or who has seen the real-life Krampus?
Krampus was horrible. Mocking jay was good, but not what I expected. the only good movie I've seen is Creed and it was AMAZING.
Krampus was honestly the worst movie I've ever seen
I hope Krampus is the biggest bust of all time ... Why tf would you ever make a scary movie about Christmas

So that #Krampus movie is...*sigh* it's good. If you like 'The Dark Crystal' 'Legend' or even 'Pan's Labyrinth' you might love Krampus.
I just watched #KrampusMovie ... it was a good movie .. it was worth watching .. #ScaryButGood #Krampus
@AnnieEerie it's actually a good movie. Unlike your Krampus, which I give 2 out of 5 stars.
Krampus looks like such a bad movie lmfao wtf
That commercial for that evil Santa movie really Krampus my style. Hahaha! Fuck you! I just made you read that!

Krampus is one of those odd movie that puts me in the Lover column instead of taking up my usual space with the Haters.
Saw the movie Krampus. Something about it reminds me of Gremlins. Fun holiday horror comedy.
@clarkewolfe I thought Krampus was a very well done Christmas Horror movie and had a very 80s style flavor to the horror movie.

I don't mean to be an ass, bc I'm sure they worked hard to produce the movie, but I hope Krampus makes nada due to the waste of money/time.

The people next to us at Krampus spent the entire movie trying to figure out what language the grandma was speaking.

If anyone wants to know Krampus is not a scary movie
@nigelgordijk Krampus..lol., not sure how I dosed off in that one . It's now my 2nd fav Christmas movie behind Nightmare before Christmas.
Taking myself to a movie ... Scary movie for 1 — watching Krampus at ArcLight Cinemas http://fb.me/2qInMAX9D 
Krampus is definitely an odd movie!
Krampus might be the worst movie I've ever seen.
Krampus is such a bad movie don't go see it
krampus is the worst movie 10/10 would not recommend
Krampus was really good. It's a perfect movie mix of horror, comedy and Christmas. Spooky, silly, and compelling. Y'all should see it. #fb
So, Krampus was kinda....weird. Funny too. Pretty good movie. Not what I expected, lol. @SeanGoesBronz
Just saw the #KrampusMovie OMG what fun. Yes I'm a Krampus nut, hence why I wrote a book about him but I would love this movie regardless.
krampus was one weird movie
krampus looks like the dumbest movie ever....
Always listen to the black woman in the movie theatre in scary movies #KrampusMovie #Krampus
Krampus was such a good movie!
The scariest part in the movie Krampus was when the iPad was at 1%.
Saw KRAMPUS and loved it. Weird thing, tho: literally two-thirds of the audience got up and left before the movie was even close to ending.
Krampus is the worst scary movie i have ever watched #refund
I really wanna go see the movie Krampus
Krampus was definitely a great movie it had all the things you want in a Christmas movie and more! #krampus

I have a gift card for two people for a movie and I wanna see krampus. Anybody?
Krampus is the worst movie of all time...
I hope they make a Krampus porno movie.
Krampus was the worst movie ever
@edwin_waters what movie? Ummm KRAMPUS
Yo krampus was actually the funniest movie I ever saw I was dying at how bad the acting was
Krampus had to be the most retarded movie
a horror movie called "krampus"? sounds a lot like a movie about girls getting their period for the holidays
Krampus had me laughing yet creeped out, good movie
#Krampus was great! Thoroughly enjoyed the film. Great creature design. A fun, dark holiday movie. Might become a yearly film for me.

Man Krampus was the best movie ever 10/10 easily. @_JasonKay_ @a_wright816
Saw Krampus. It was okay. Felt like it was a 40 minute movie stretched to 90. Very light hearted family horror. Forgettable, though.
@michellekaljaj krampus is actually a really interesting German legend but they messed up the movie big time
Krampus is by far the most messed up movie I have ever seen.
Actually now considering going to see that Krampus movie because I know it will be so absolutely terrible
Krampus is the worst movie ever :/
Krampus is the dumbest movie I have ever seen

I just saw krampus and I'd compare it to a darker sean of the dead type movie. Good shit.
Wtf is krampus I need to see this movie
Krampus is definitely a Christmas movie I'd watch every year @mradamscott
The movie #Krampus was lit though. I liked the overall message it sends out to keep hope alive always, sacrifice, be giving and GRATEFUL.
#Krampus is the 21st century "A Christmas Carol." It's been too long since we had a movie like this. Equally great horror/comedy/Xmas flick!
All I think of when I see previews for the krampus movie is that episode of the office where Dwight dresses up as Belsnickel

@EmjayAnthony krampus was the best movie ever!!! Good job
I was happy to see another Christmas movie out. Until I watched the trailer. Thanks Krampus for ruining my Christmas spirit.
So I watched Krampus today, and let me just say, it was was a great movie but it was so weird and fucked up on so many levels.
krampus might just be the worst movie ive ever seen
Krampus was a pretty good movie
I like the idea of KRAMPUS a lot more than the actual experience. No suspense. Just goes from a comedy to an action movie.
In a huge upset, Krampus ($16 million) beats The Good Dinosaur for the number 2 spot behind the Hunger Games. Such a demented, fun movie!
I can't be the only one who thinks this Krampus movie is a flop
Feels like a movie w/ Adam Scott, David Koechner, Toni Collette & Conchata Ferrell should've been funnier but appreciated the risk. #KRAMPUS

That new movie Krampus doesn't even look scary, but when I hear that "you better watch out" on Spotify alone at midnight I cry a little bit
Really like the movie Krampus, not really a "horror" film but it was pretty funny
If you go to the movies do not watch krampus dumbest movie I ever seen
I'm judging you so hard if you see the movie Krampus...... what the fuck
back to the krampus thing though. today was krampus day and these guys just run around hitting people. i hope the movie is more complex.
The movie Krampus is the best thing that has come to theaters in a while
#Krampus might just be my new favorite holiday movie. I actually cried because I laughed so hard. #KrampusMovie

Krampus was a great twisted Christmas movie defiantly a movie I'm gonna watch every year @KrampusMovie #KrampusMovie
Movie Review: Krampus. Unsettling to say the least. Had mouth wide open for ten minutes. Didn't know how to feel. Rating: 8.5 creepy snowmen
KRAMPUS is kind of a nasty little holiday movie. I respect that. In case you missed it, here's my 4/5 review: http://filmracket.com/krampus/ 
"Befuddled Adam Scott" is more than one horror movie's secret weapon. #Krampus
just got back from seeing #Krampus at #AMC. It was pretty quirky but enjoyable! A very fun movie :D Absolutely loved it!
Wow don't watch krampus what a stupid movie
Krampus is a weird ass movie lol
So krampus was the worst movie I've ever seen
That feeling when one of your favorite actors ends up in a pretty bad movie. #Krampus
"Krampus"— truly one of the fugliest movie titles of 2k15
Krampus was the worst movie of the year! It was as stupid as the trailer looked. The only reason y i watched it was bcuz my gf
#Krampus! OMG nice movie! (@ Cineworld for Krampus in Greenwich, Greater London w/ @alekx3) https://www.swarmapp.com/c/0gf8KmYzgdy

If you want to see the worst movie in the world, go to Krampus.
If krampus and Santa Claus don't get in some kind of epic battle at the end of the movie , I want my money back .
If you want a solid Horror movie with a creepy atmosphere and competently written characters that are not cracked to 11 check out Krampus
I've never felt this distant from Rotten Tomatoes & Movie Critics for this year because Krampus was fucking EXCELLENT!!
@mradamscott absolutely loved krampus, such an amazing and hilarious movie I want to watch it again 10/10 recommend to watch
I wonder how that Krampus movie is.. I'm surprised on it getting good reviews
Can't decide if the #Krampus movie is a terrible idea or a stroke of genius
that new horror movie Krampus looks so fucking stupid lmao adam scott wyd in this movie
Krampus looks like a cheap knock off movie with bad actors
@magencubed I literally want to see Krampus just for Adam Scott. So this very much helped confirm his cutetivity in the movie.

Krampus was the most burnt movie of all time
#Krampus is to Gremlins what the eventual SyFy original movie cashgrab reboot of Gremlins is to Gremlins.
Congrats to Alex and George on winning a double movie pass to Krampus!! Keep it tuned in for opportunities to win pic.twitter.com/Ld4aQXQJns
Y'all Krampus is like my new favorite movie
If the success of KRAMPUS proves anything, it's movie goers are hungry for more holiday horror (not to be read as more Krampus knockoffs).
Krampus was easily the most horrifying movie I've ever seen
And I'm sorry, I know I'm rambling but I just can't get over how much I friggin LOVED this movie. It's just.....FUN! #Krampus

@KrampusMovie is amazing to watch with your eyes it's the best movie to go see right now!! Go go go seeee it!!! #Krampus
Breaking news. The movie industry is now shutting down due to no one being able to make a better movie than Krampus
How about "Krampus" huh? #2 movie of the weekend. Horror will never die at the Box Office.
i was down to watch adam scott in krampus until i found out it was a scary movie
if i get a puppy for christmas im naming it krampus after that movie
The Krampus movie @krampusmovie was absolutely brilliant. Seriously. I will see this one again, and I will buy it when released on DVD.
Krampus was the worst movie I have ever seen

#Krampus is my guilty pleasure movie of the holiday season. A must see @KrampusMovie
buried somewhere in the movie called krampus there's a much better movie also called krampus
#Krampus was my ideal holiday movie! Which is to say, less of the typical family cheer, and more of the killer toys set on destruction
Krampus was a crap movie wth
Okay that movie was actually really good lol #Krampus good acting, funny, creepy & sad.
Krampus appeals to me and I am in search of a fellow movie-going krampus enthusiast
@JohnnyFocal Funny how they cast #Austrian actress #KristaStadler as #Omi in #Hollywood movie #Krampus? Maybe the #ChristophWaltz effect?;-)
If you were thinking about seeing Krampus please don't go see it...total waste of money, wasn't scary at all, dumbest movie ever..
#Krampus Firmly in B movie territory. For the first 20mins characters are quite annoying bt once it starts getting creepy it's gr8.***1/2
Omg, if you want a really funny movie, go see Krampus too funny
That movie krampus looks so bad but id luuuuv to see it tbf
Weird that I wanna go see that krampus movie ?
. @KrampusMovie has an old fashioned 90s family film vibe combined with classic horror movie reveals and jumps! Overall thrilling! #Krampus
Killing a little time before the movie. — watching Krampus at Santikos Silverado IMAX http://fb.me/7XAudY7by 
Krampus was so wild from start to finish I cannot believe that is a real movie
I'm taking myself to see that movie Krampus tonight ♡ I had no idea it was out already but in excited to see it!
I enjoyed watching Krampus, could've been better tho but if ur a fan of Labyrinth minus the singing, I think u'll like this one #movie
@08lc3 Just say that it's based on the legend of Krampus, not the movie.
Krampus was a weird movie but i liked it
Krampus. I didn't care for it because it wasn't the movie I wanted to see. Not mean spirited enough for my taste. pic.twitter.com/QB9bhBNWee
All right I watched my Christmas movie for the year, Krampus was disturbing and evil (how it should be)
I want to see Krampus or whatever but I'm not a scary movie person so I might cry at the movie theater
Liked on YouTube: KRAMPUS Movie Clip - Jack in the Box (2015) Christmas Horror Movie HD http://youtu.be/JmlbqeyvagY 
Krampus was a fantastic movie. Highly recommend seeing it.
I think Krampus is what happens when you try to apply the formula of Evil Dead II to a Christmas movie, but can't commit to absurdist humor.
i just saw that krampus movie with mariah and i dont know how i feel about it it was hmm
Also Krampus is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen paranormal activity 3 and mean girls 2
@nerdist @scottEweinberg Saw Krampus Friday night. Great holiday horror flick and just a fun movie overall. Spot on review!

I enjoyed Krampus but there were some dull moments that let it down. So many kids in a horror movie make it difficult to go all the way.

@dvdinfatuation I'd like an ambitious production company release a movie like #Krampus with both a PG-13 and R rating at the same time.
Krampus is such a dumb movie..
So I recently saw the Krampus movie and it was good but these kids kept on screaming and stomping all over the place. We all cracked up ha.
I wanna see that movie Krampus
All the hype about krampus is bullshit. It's the most ridiculously stupid movie I've ever seen
Krampus was the worst movie I've ever seen
I hope Krampus is a good horror movie.. The concept seems pretty awesome
Krampus was probably the worst movie to ever be made
krampus is a poo movie!!!! do not waste yall mula
I'd say Krampus wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I'd be lying.
@rarestofall_ Krampus isn't scary. It's like a scary Disney movie basically.
Saw Krampus yesterday.. it wasn't even scary, tbh. was the stupidest movie ever.
The movie krampus hardcore fucked my head
Krampus was a horrible movie
So like I saw Krampus that scary Christmas movie & I'm sending a letter to Santa this year for sure
So the timing of this Krampus movie... talmbout "when the Christmas spirit is lost Krampus comes instead".... really
Yeah sure, this Krampus movie looks great. But, I'm holding out for next year when 'Krampus 2, Big Man on Krampus" comes out.
if you're thinking about seeing the movie Krampus, i recommend you don't waste your money
#Krampus gets a 10/10. That movie was bizarre and I loved every surreal moment
Krampus was such a weird movie
Krampus: the movie doesn’t quite come together quite as well as Trick ‘r Treat, but there’s still plenty to like. #Horror
Also I'm SO happy we got a new iconic creature to add to the classic movie monsters hall of fame. Just hope @NECA_TOYS do figs! #Krampus
Krampus was a terrible movie. DO NOT waste your money on that
Want to watch that Krampus movie, but too much of a shite bag to watch myself

Movie Review – Krampus http://goo.gl/QnM1et 
After seeing the Krampus ad so many times, it's actually turned me off from watching the movie. Good job, marketing team. Good job.
Krampus is weirdly one of my favorite movies of the year. I want to make a movie like that.
Krampus looks like a horrible idea for a movie. I must see it immediately.
Krampus is just a nice horror movie s2g we're laughing so hard to the ghosts @SafiahKiddo @puterisofiahh

@kyla_nicole05 We missed our first movie so we saw Krampus instead
Krampus: kind of a fun movie w/charming production values & a firm fantasy grasp. I just wish the comedy & horror had been sharper/ballsier.

the movie Krampus is probably a 6/10

#MovieChronicles2015 - KRAMPUS. Now what will put you in the Christmas spirit more than a movie… https://www.instagram.com/p/-7vO5miXMi/ 
DO NOT SEE KRAMPUS, it is THE worst and cheesiest movie you will ever see. In your entire life.
So I wonder how stoked Taco from The League is that they're making a Krampus movie...
I don't think Krampus could have been anymore of a stupid movie. I don't recommend spending any money to see it.
Krampus movie is most enjoyable if you imagine it as a gritty post-modern/Vertigo-style retelling of Home Alone.
Nobody go see Krampus.. Worst movie in the entire world.. I would classify it as a comedy.
After seeing the movie #Krampus, I hate everything
PSA: Do not see Krampus; it is actually the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life
Who else has seen the Krampus movie? What did you think?
No one go see that krampus movie. Very stupid
Never let @abs_pitts pick the movie. She'll force you to watch something like Krampus and ruin your Christmas spirit.
Current state: traumatized. Krampus scared the bejesus out of me. The special effects and spooky plot got me! Scariest movie since Jacob.
I'm sad that Paul Naschy never got to make a Krampus movie or a werewolf vs. Krampus movie. #sad
PSA: don't go see Krampus if you want to see a quality scary movie. You will be very disappointed
People who've seen Krampus screenings are saying it's actually a really good movie. Go figure.
what the hell was the movie Krampus
as someone who enjoys almost every horror movie that comes out in theaters, Krampus was..... not good
