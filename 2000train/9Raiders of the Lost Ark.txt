@MrMovees87 I've seen Raiders of the lost ark, I refuse to watch any of the others. I like Harrison ford, didn't like the movie.
In such a broken, divided society, can't we all just agree that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest movie ever?
Asps, very dangerous. You go first. (Classis line from Raiders of the Lost Ark) Never get tired of that movie. Great story telling and plot.
I'd pick Raiders of the Lost Ark if I had a choice, but Kevin Smith is really making the better arguments on his movie #moviefightslive

My takeaway from rewatching Raiders of the Lost Ark: How is that movie PG? Its SO violent! Ah the 80's, a simpler time.
Point Break is a perfect movie. Line for line, shot for shot perfect. It needs a remake about as much as Raiders of The Lost Ark.

@CastingAbout @IWCriticwire Raiders of the Lost Ark, my favorite movie of all-time.
So that movie Raiders of the Lost Ark was pretty ok. The lead, I think his name is Haroldson Ford? He's hot, like a poor man's Chris Pratt.

Sitting in @AmericanFilm Silver waiting for Raiders of the Lost Ark to start. The best movie EVER!! Trust me!!
@Jake_TSV I guess it depends on the definition of "Action Movie". For example, Saving Private Ryan, or Raiders of the Lost Ark?
@joe_hill Raiders of the Lost Ark is *most definitely* an action movie: note how it is basically nonstop action.

Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark. Top 10 movie that hasn't aged. Karen Allen: Animal House, Ark, Scrooged. Never heard from again. Weird.
30+ years later, the face-melting scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark still wows me like it did when I saw the movie as a kid.
No hoops on tonight so I'm watching Raiders of the Lost Ark on USA. Still one of the best ever. That Crystal Skull movie never happened.
So baby's first exposure to any kind of movie is Raiders of the Lost Ark, completely fine with this, #StartingHimRight
One movie you don't change the channel on: Raiders of the Lost Ark
'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the greatest movie ever made and I will whip anyone who thinks otherwise.
Raiders of the Lost Ark is a perfect movie. Fight me if you disagree.

I hear people hyping this ImitationGame movie, I've seen it...it ain't no Raiders of the Lost Ark. Where's that movie like they use to make?
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is a perfectly crafted movie, but E.T. is so damn beautiful. I personally have to place it higher than RAIDERS.

Re-watching Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The music doesn't vary much. And some of the movie seems dated.

25 minutes into Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie has aged very well.
If that first Pirates Of The Caribbean movie was 30 minutes shorter it would be considered a classic on par with Raiders Of The Lost Ark.
Apparently there's some movie trying to capitalize on the recent hype surrounding 'Noah', it's called 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Shameless.
