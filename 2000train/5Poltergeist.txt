Poltergeist is my favorite type of horror movie but I'm concerned about watching the new one since I read @scottEweinberg's review.
That fact makes it an even stronger movie in retrospect, IMO. #POLTERGEIST
@LanceToff97 poltergeist you jumped, besides not every horror movie
@GidgitVonLaRue Always wondered that myself. I know i'd get the hell out. I've never seen that movie btw. Seen Poltergeist.
Apparently, the movie "Krampus" is NOT about a premenstrual poltergeist. Adjust your expectations accordingly.
remember when I told yu it was as if the Exorcist movie met/crossed poltergeist one/?!

In the movie Poltergeist, they used real skeletons. When asked why it was a simple answer, "they were cheaper than the plastic ones."
Krampus was actually great....real old school..felt like a Spielberg movie from the 80's..think Poltergeist and Gremlims
You know how the house imploded at the end of the original movie, poltergeist? That can happen to #konami now. https://twitter.com/gameinformer/status/672625419548565504 …

Got everything for quesadillas! @netflix needs better horror/thriller movies. Just got a @redbox movie. #Poltergeist. Better be gooood.
Watch 'Poltergeist' by Tobe Hopper . Still a scary creepy Movie with an very fantastic score. A must have on Blu-Ray.
Come to think of it, based on my 'perfect horror movie' criteria, the original Poltergeist film passes nearly every check on the list.

The new poltergeist movie was good. However I laughed about 5 times and I wasn't scared at any point. #iwanttobescared
So...why is Poltergeist on the @ABCFamily channel. That movie still terrifies me.
Halloween movie marathon? Yes, please! #saturdayhalloweenrocks #Misery #NightmareOnElmStreet #Poltergeist #Psycho
Watching, "Poltergeist." I'm pretty sure the toy clown in that movie scarred me more as a kid than Tim Curry in, "It."

Nothing says ABC Family like the movie Poltergeist on Halloween.
The movie Poltergeist paints a negative stereotype of ghosts and is oppressive, yu living shitlords. #Ghostshaming
Just watched the original "Poltergeist" and Scary Movie 2 makes a lot more sense now.

Classic Halloween movie by Steven Spielberg, Poltergeist (1982), next on the Family Channel: http://www.tv.com/movies/poltergeist/?ref=tweet_button …
I've been watching a movie what feels like forever and it just came to me it was poltergeist
I don't know how I watched Poltergeist so much as a child without being scared. This movie is so good but so terrifying #faves
Watching the old Poltergeist movie with my niece, I've forgot about the clown scene
Dear Abc Family, I know youre changing to Freeform but as of right now you are still a "family" channel and idt Poltergeist is a kid movie
The old poltergeist movie was way better than the new one
watching the poltergeist on abc family and this movie isn't kid/family friendly at all lmao
poltergeist is the craziest fucking movie
Poltergeist is on ABC Family right now and all I can do is cringe, it's not so great of a movie.
My kid said he wanted to watch a scary movie so I turned on Poltergeist. He asked me to turn it off real quick.
The most overrated "scary movie" of all time has to be Poltergeist.
Watching POLTERGEIST and wishing Steven Spielberg would just scrap READY PLAYER ONE and make a horror movie next.
Seeing Poltergeist in an hour. SO EXCITEDDDDDD!!! Gotta love Cinema City's Halloween movie nights
chances are we're gonna watch poltergeist and im gonna apologize profusely to cerridwen throughout the whole movie
I'm not a horror movie fan, and I don't know if I have a favorite, but I've always enjoyed the original Poltergeist. http://cinemassacre.com/2009/10/21/21-poltergeist-1982/ …
"This movie is really mean spirited. It actually seems to want to hurt you!" @IPFjosh on revisiting Poltergeist for #ScarollGardens
If you're not gonna show the 'Ima rip off my face' scene in Poltergeist your horror movie editing judgment is flawed.
I'll watch The Poltergeist then Entourage The Movie after because Vincent is lowkey my baby daddy.
Poltergeist will always be a weird movie.
they're showing POLTERGEIST on abc family for some ungodly reason and it reminds me of how awesome this movie is
Me: you little kids need to leave. Kids: no we don't. Me: presses play for the old poltergeist movie. Kids: see the creepy clown and leave.

they're playing the poltergeist on abc family. um. that is not a family movie. abc family u ok
The chick in the new poltergeist movie is hot!
Why is Poltergeist on ABC Family? I know it's from '82, but still. That movie was terrifying.
So far this movie appears to be a remake of "The Money Pit." Actually maybe "The Money Pit" is a remake of "Poltergeist."
Poltergeist is on ABC family. That movie scared the hell out of me when I was a child...how is it now a family film?
and then she turned off the tv because she seriously thinks i'll get scared. the movie was poltergeist.
HORROR MOVIE NIGHT. And tomorrow but tonight is Poltergeist night
Since when is poltergeist a family movie?!? Lol it's on abcFamily right now XD
Why is Poltergeist being played on abc family. That movie is scary af.
The poltergeist is such a scary movie!! I can't believe I'm watching it by myself..
@KarenMN @gjcharlet by 12 I had seen tons of old B-movie horror, and Poltergeist, and TX Chainsaw.
The movie Poltergeist was an ominous warning about not paying your cable & electric bill on time.
i love the movie Ghost but i also love Beetlejuice i love old halloween movies except Poltergeist that movie is shit
@SiennCarr was wishing for a real poltergeist to come take me away the whole movie
Poltergeist sucked. I just wanted a scary movie but I laughed the whole time
The Poltergeist is a hilarious amazing Halloween movie why don't we talk about it
The movie Poltergeist is just bizarre! Not really that scary, just very bizarre. lol
Poltergeist is a good movie
The single greatest lie in all of movie history... "This house is clean." #poltergeist

It's been a long time since I watched the original Poltergeist. I forgot how supremely messed up that movie is. #fb
Maya's been asking me what this year's Halloween movie was. Was stumped but just realized the original Poltergeist might be perfect.
I watched the Poltergeist remake. It was good, but not great. The original movie is still better.
I'll believe everything about this movie except that the mom is 32 and their oldest is 16 #Poltergeist
Watching the new poltergeist movie. It's not as scary as they make it out to be.
#Halloween movie marathon begins - #Poltergeist (1-3), #HocusPocus, #DarkShadows, #Ghostbusters What's your favorite movie?
I'm watching Poltergeist and realized I was the kids age in the movie when it came out, now I'm the parents age! #nowthatsscary
You know you're old when #Poltergeist, a movie that terrified you as a child, is now on ABCFamily. #OldMan #Halloween
I'm horrified to see the Poltergeist is on Abc Family. I saw that movie when I was 13 and it haunted me for years. #butimaweenie
Poltergeist -the original from 1983 or so - is on ABC Family right now Great eve of Halloween movie.
Also did universities have paranormal depts, or is this just an 80s movie trope? #Poltergeist #Ghostbusters #liesfilmtellsaboutacademia
Watching #Poltergeist for prolly the 1st time since I was a teen—is this movie a warning about the dangers of Reaganomics?
Poltergeist is such a stupid movie
Poltergeist on @abcfamily? That movie scared the hell out of me as a kid. Guess that passes as family friendly
I remember Poltergeist as a terrifying flick. I'm watching it now and it's a hilariously awful movie.
I like the old Poltergeist movie, I won't dare watch the new one!

Poltergeist gotta be the weakest scary movie to come out this year besides Lazarus Effect
That Poltergeist commercial just freaked me out. So I probably shouldn't watch the actual movie.

Saw Poltergeist (2015) today. Wasn't bad BUT it was a remake of a movie that didn't need remaking. Make sense?

It was movie day with our #COOLcreators, learning how to analyze #horror elements in #Poltergeist
So I bought the original Poltergeist movie for Haleigh (since she "doesn't scare easily") can't wait to watch w/ her!

Watching the new poltergeist movie.. I don't know how I feel about it

For a movie made in 1982, Poltergeist is chock full of amazing quotes. Thanks @michaelgrais
Poltergeist is such a terrible movie. Having a bunch of pop ups does not make it a horror film.
Was the new Poltergeist movie hot garbage? Debating watching it.
