@BPS_movie Mahalo Duncan, for following us.. Please check http://www.facebook.com/paradisejustice  and http://paradisejusticehawaii.com  Aloha!
Two things I've learned recently: Flat White drinks from Starbucks are disgusting & the movie Aloha is disappointing and a waste of time.
The movie "Aloha" was adorable :)))
"Aloha" is the worst movie I have seen since "Birdman."
I know it got bad reviews, but I loved that movie Aloha with Bradley Cooper (yum) I found it adorably romantic!

I love the movie Aloha so much
I just spotted @ivanamilicevic in the movie #Aloha. Been a big fan of hers since Enemy of the State. pic.twitter.com/NuiagOVAUE
my mom is making me watch a movie about 18 y/o girls in another country getting kidnapped.. I think she's hinting at something
Every movie should have Gremlin appearances. Imagine if ALOHA ended with the new batch of Gremlins killing the entire cast? Five stars.
Gotta love how Starz is airing #Aloha, a movie that came out 6 months ago, while Showtime's big weekend premiere is 2013's #SpringBreakers
How could you hate a movie as delightfully bizarre as Aloha?
love the movie aloha
Aloha is such a sweet movie

New favorite movie has to be Aloha. Damn I would love to move to Hawaii
Aloha proving to be a pretty decent movie
Seriously, Ant-Man is the 2nd worst movie of the year for me. Saved only by Aloha.
Watching #Aloha again, it's a good movie... yeah, it could use some more polynesians but I like that they used emma stone bcuz most r hapa

@EW @Leahbats Agreed. These Hollywood sluts are lining up to make a movie with Bradley Cooper and they are turning out to be shit. Aloha?
Clueless is such a hands down cute movie
Aloha was actually such a cute movie.
Aloha is the cutest movie ever
Kim and Kayne should have named there child after the movie Aloha. I cannot think of anything else that represents pure joy like that movie.

Krampus was literally the best worst movie ever
It's Oscar movie season and yet we just watched Aloha. Huh.
the most underrated cast was the cast of aloha they made that movie so great
@NerdPoetics I don't think it would have improved Aloha or Blackhat though. Hemsworth holding my hand couldn't have made that a good movie.

"aloha" is a weird movie. i think i'm still watching it because i really love bradley and krasinski.
I hope to one day look as good in my blues and ABU just like Emma Stone did in the movie Aloha.
great my mom decided it's movie night and now we are watching Aloha, a romance movie
Besides "Aloha". Hate that movie.
Folks, ALOHA is an irritating movie. It veers from tome to tone every 30 seconds and wastes good actors.
The movie Aloha just made me cry......
So this Aloha movie is Bradley Cooper choosing between Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams? I envy that choice.

"Aloha" can mean many things; unfortunately, I just discovered that it also means terrible movie.
@RadioBethany watching a crown for Christmas! You were right the most perfect Christmas movie!
@scottrenshaw Makenzie Davis THE MARTIAN; Jason Statham SPY; Eva Green THE SALVATION. Not actually a bad movie but Rachel McAdams in ALOHA.
@edgarwright definitely not ALOHA, that movie didn't explain fucking anything
aloha is not a good movie 0/10
@anna_way95 in the movie Aloha!
@KirkWrites79 not sure even Bradley Cooper is one. He can't open a movie on his name alone (see: ALOHA, BURNT)
@KaileyMarsh it is definitely hard to make a good movie from bad script. Muddling through ALOHA and the script is kind of the biggest issue.
@NoFxcksGivenn__ this the type of movie that everybody gon be fighting after they see it
@CoolKidMyaaa "alright billy we need something fresh, something exciting" "bob I got, it scary Christmas movie!" "Brilliant"
@Aloha_Drea LMFAO u can't be doin stuff like that wit a Christmas movie we celebratin jesus, white folks I tell u
I love the movie aloha! It's such a realistic love movie
ALOHA - it is a movie. More thoughts to come.
Rented Paper Towns, Aloha, and The Gallows for a movie night with myself :-)

an elderly-ish guy came in and said he loved the movie Aloha. whatever he was on when he watched it, I wish I had some when I saw it.
#Aloha is only .99 on #iTunes this week. Pretty good movie. Only down fall was Danny McBride. Not sure what it is but he ruins every movie.
Thankful for the word 'Aloha,' a word with so many meanings it is meaningless. The movie, too!

The movie 'Aloha' is undoubtedly the worst film I've seen this year. Emma Stone's acting is unbearable. Sad that it's a Cameron Crowe film.
@DirtyPopLive The movie "Aloha" was directed by Cameron Crowe not James Cameron. Is that a #Ruther mistake?
Wow. Massive respect to Aloha movie for using the actual Elders of the Indigenous population in the movie.
I'm not quite sure what this movie is about so far, but it's not a regular rom-com & I'm very happy about that. #aloha

Aloha is, without a doubt, the worst movie ever made in the history of the world. And this is a world with Mad Max: Fury Road in it.
The only reason Aloha bombed was because the budget was ridiculous. It's an amazing movie though

Watched the movie "Aloha". Emma Stone was great in it. Why we can't just look past things and see people are different and in many forms.
That doesn't necessarily make ALOHA make any more sense, but it's entirely in keeping with the overall inscrutability of the movie.

Aloha may be the worst movie ever #wheelsonthebus

#Film #Movie #FilmDiscussion - Did you see the film "Aloha"? I'm curious as to the feelings/reactions you have towards the film whether or …
Just watched the movie "Aloha" with my wife ... I fell asleep 3 times and had no idea what the plot was... But Emma Stone looked good
I haven't decided if ALOHA is a good movie, but the dialogue is getting plenty of laughs. And Bill Murray.
Aloha - I like all the people involved in this movie, director and actors. That said wow this movie is so so bad. Avoid at all cost.
Aloha was a terrible movie the first 2 times I saw it, but, the optimist in me says three times a charm.
Has anyone seen the movie Aloha? Hmmmm this is very interesting. http://fb.me/7EMq6H0pL 
Bradley Cooper, Rachel McAdams, and Emma Stone in one feel good movie? Watch Aloha and be amazed at what the Hawaiian sky can tell you.
Have you ever seen a movie so bad, that you think about it at random times and get angry when you do? That's Aloha for me.
aloha is my new favorite movie I love it so much

I recommend the movie "Aloha" with Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone.....wow! Great movie
"Aloha" was such a cute movie !!
Last movie I saw was Aloha!! On the plane while going to Hawaii #SEOchat
I just finished watching Aloha and I still have no idea what the movie is about.

Tried to watch 'Aloha' tonight, thinking 'how bad could a Cameron Crowe movie really be?' 20 minutes in and we're like nope nope nope nope
We should be more mad about the movie #Aloha being absurdly boring than we are about Emma Stone being cast as an Asian chick.

Watching Aloha http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1243974/ … Man this movie is a real piece of TU Kai (Thanks, internet, for teaching me to swear in Hawaiian)

Still upset over how much of a letdown the movie aloha was.
Saw ALOHA and now I understand Amy Pascal's leaked email about it... The movie is so incoherent I don't know how it could be fixed.
Okay I beat the game I feel accomplished and now it's movie time! #aloha https://instagram.com/p/8NZXjIHb5U/ 
MCM definitely goes to Bradley Cooper. I fall more in love with him every movie I watch of his. Aloha was so good
@tyloor_21 that movie was rubbish
@wally_rae @bottomcaptain XD I knooow it looks just above what a normal Marvel movie does but then RedBand and its like WTF JUST HAPPENED
AND they're screening the movie Aloha?? Is this supposed to be a test of character or an episode of Boiling Point???
The movie Aloha was a huge disappointment. I have no idea what was going on during the entire movie

Harry Potter movie marathons are always a good idea
Aloha is the strangest movie to include space launch as plot. It's like they decided to make a weird indie movie but spend $35M on casting.
Another movie recommendation: Aloha.

The movie aloha was so all over the place
I cried at the end of "Aloha".. Such a good movie
Aw the movie Aloha, love
The movie aloha is not what I thought it was 2 hours wasted for good
Cannot get over how cute the movie "Aloha" is. Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, and Bradley Cooper can do no bad!
When the psychic told me I'd marry someone in uniform.. I bet she was talking about Bradley Cooper in the movie aloha. #godblessamerica
About half-an-hour into "Aloha" ... and it's not terrible? It's even decent in a Sunday-night-movie-on-TNT/TBS kind of way.
@WesPhillips @MrPope Oh, there's a movie called Aloha? I thought this was a new app, like Snapchat or Grindr.
Aloha is such a good movie. Love Bradley Cooper!
Looking for to new movie being flimed in Hawaii this October. I believe it will be a lot of fun . Aloha!!
Just watched Cameron Crowes latest Aloha, very good movie

"I go hard, I go deep, sometimes I break things' - actual words from Bradley Cooper in Aloha. This movie is a travesty.
The free movie on this plane is Aloha. No.
No, Aloha wasn't great, but I still like a Cameron Crowe movie.

@AlohaTheMovie I loved Aloha. That movie was amazing from beginning to end!
Just rented "aloha," worst movie ever. @AlecBaldwin, Bill Murray, Bradley Cooper stole 2 hours of my life I'll never get back
Aloha. Not a good movie. Not a bad movie. Some great moments. Lots of boredom. Great scene between Bradley Cooper and John Krasinski. #Aloha
Aloha is the best terrible movie I've seen. I gave up 38 times during it.
The movie Aloha was weird and not at all what I was expecting. So confusing.

Im so in love with that part in the Aloha movie where they were talking about being shot i watched that part 600 times i know it by memory

WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE?? Aloha is absolutely worth seeing for the WTF factor.
@ONAConf What does the panel think about the movie Aloha, in which Emma Stone's character is half Hawaiian, part Chinese? #ona15future
That last scene in the movie #Aloha.. so beautiful. I felt every part of it. Touched my heart.
I keep thinking about Bill Murray's future speech in Aloha. Makes sense in the trailer but wasted in the movie for a quick scene.

Watched the movie "ALOHA." Surely their setting are somewhat strange. but I liked this movie.
Utterly confused by the movie Aloha. Bradley Cooper is a babe tho so it's ok
I think I'm going to attempt to watch Aloha tonight... Remember me fondly and warmly if this movie really is as horrible as they say.

Your nick nolte impression was spot on. Loved the movie, though. Any chance of an Aloha review? @KermodeMovie
Real talk: Watching a movie about the crash of Aloha 243 the night before flying a 737 home to MSP probably wasn’t smart. And it’s choppy.

Should i watch Aloha? A Cameron Crowe movie set in Hawaii w/ Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone & Bill Murray. (On paper = best movie ever made)
Nothing says welcome back to the good ol' US of A more than having your inflight movie be cinematic classic that is "Aloha."
Has anyone seen the movie Aloha with Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper? Is it good?
Whenever someone cries about remakes and no original ideas for movies I'm just going to ask them if they saw that Aloha movie.
The movie Aloha is actually just a lot of pretty and talented faces saying 'aloha' a lot. I'm not kidding.
I never knew how much I needed an Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper movie until I watched aloha. Such a good movie.
Did anyone see the movie Aloha? WHAT A GOOD MOVIE

Aloha is a weirdly confusing movie
Aloha was a weird movie . I was so confused majority of the time.
ALOHA Movie Clip – “My Brain is Unpickable” (Bradley Cooper & Emma Stone) https://spoilericity.com/2015/09/12/film/aloha-movie-clip-my-brain-is-unpickable-bradley-cooper-emma-stone/ …
Aloha is without question the worst movie I've ever seen. Crowe should retire while he's still ahead. Stone & Cooper - embarrassingly bad
It looks like Aloha is a movie about people smiling.
Just watched the movie Aloha. It goes from so-so to awful to hilariously bad to disjointed and perplexing at an impressive rate.
WTF!? #Aloha is one of the worst movie I had seeing ever! pic.twitter.com/OJnRxWeyOe
PSA: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT EVER SEE THE MOVIE ALOHA. Save yourself.
I am watching a movie called Aloha with Emma Stone and some dude I can't record his name was you would just have to look it up on the intern
I HIGHLY recommend the movie "Aloha"!!! #aloha
Four minutes into Aloha and it's already the best movie I've ever seen.

Ok so the movie Aloha is a not what I was expecting, but John Krasinski in a flight suit?! Thank you movie gods!
Having a chill day and watching the movie Aloha
Aloha should be called "Trailer - The Movie". Almost every shot feels like it's built to be used in marketing.
Aloha is officially the worst movie I've ever seen. Yes, worst than The Lake House...
Aloha was a good boring movie

Aloha is the biggest disappointment of a movie ever
Every movie box says best movie of the year, but Aloha is probably the most fitting of the tittle
I'm watching this movie #Aloha...... not sure why this is a movie. What is happening here......?
Just watched the movie Aloha and I honestly couldn't even tell you what it was about
This Aloha movie has 19% on rotten tomatoes. I struggle to understand how one in five people enjoyed it.

Aloha is such a cute military movie. I'm literally crying.
as high profile as aloha's cast is, it was a very mediocre movie. i wanted it to be good, just wasn't
Aloha is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.
Every scene in Aloha has a movie's worth of dialogue, a climactic line, a music cue, a deep "figuring it out" moment and none of it carries.

This Aloha movie is kinda not what it was cracked up to be disappointment has a name
I just tried to watch the movie Aloha and couldn't finish it. I'm going to go try and shower it off.

Just remembered overhearing someone last night who wasn't a fan of Foxcatcher, "a movie about a wrestler," but was lauding Aloha. Blurg.
Just watched ALOHA. The summer's worst movie with a love story set on an island is still LAVA.
The movie Aloha is so fucking weird..
Couldn't really tell you what the movie Aloha was about. I was a bit busy staring at Bradley Cooper
Watching this thug movie aloha it's good
Watching the movie Aloha, makes me miss living in Hawaii
Me: I can rent Aloha hubby: worst movie ever by Bradley Cooper me: but it's Bradley Cooper hubby: it made $400 at box office me: now $405
|Aloha| Funny movie! Great cast, but for those with #brainfog it's pretty fast and confusing!
Aloha is the cutest movie ever.
Aloha is such a bad movie
The in-flight movie is "Aloha" and it's a pretty good parody of a Cameron Crowe movie.
"Aloha" is playing on this plane. While it makes me miss Hawaii, this movie is so effing weird.
@TheWannaBePj013 We saw you in Aloha, right at the beginning! The movie peaked right there.
Cheesy but Aloha is actually a good movie
Yeah, I know I'm late on this, but just saw the movie Aloha. "Hawaiian By Birth. American By Force." Really makes me want to go visit Hawaii
'aloha' i say as the movie titles weve been making salmon fishing in the yemen jokes on twitter for over a year

the movie Aloha has too many metaphors and leprechauns

I love everything about the movie "Aloha"... Down to the font in the end credits. Holy crap. #Aloha
so confused by this movie aloha lol
"Aloha" the movie is epically, terribly, wordily, tremendously, stylishly BAD. Avoid at all costs.
Just watched the worst movie of all (present) time: #Aloha. #Noloha
Watched the movie Aloha tonight. Special. Was panned by critics. Not a rom-com. But it's good. Cameron Crowe does well again.
Aloha is such a cute movie pls
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang Aloha is a really good movie
Current status: trapped watching ‘Aloha’ (the Emma Stone-is-Asian-American movie) near a baby who can't sleep. Gonna be a long night.
Watching "Aloha" now. Another movie that has not gotten a good rap, but I'm really hoping to like.
I'm really let down by the movie aloha...best cast..horrible movie
Aloha- the movie where every conversation is had through meaningful "looks"

Just watched #Aloha the 2nd time. Such a feel good movie, love films about/ inclusive of the South Pacific and our cultures!

Aloha was such a good movie. Got me right in the feels. Love me some Bradley cooper and Emma stone. #wealljustwanttoloveandbeloved
I picked up a lovely tropical Aloha shirt in the Bahamas .. along with a political movie, sold to on the street by the director himself!
Aloha isn't a very good movie. The only good thing about it was John Krasinski being in it
I expected so much from the movie Aloha, I get disappointed. It's like 'bradley-jennifer chemistry beat that!' Lol
Aloha is such a cute movie
aloha is the cutest thank u to the gods for putting bradley cooper and john krasinski in the same movie
Watching this Aloha movie is making me miss Hawaii
Aloha isn't a good movie. But Cameron Crowe sure knows how to put heart in his films.
Just watched the movie #Aloha was expecting a cute love story, instead spent 90% of the movie in a state of confusion #weird
I'm glad @TVandDinners is finally watching Aloha so someone can share in my hatred of that terrible fucking movie.
The movie "aloha" is a very confusing and hard to follow movie but it has a lot of quotable lines.
I just watched ALOHA. And man does that movie make me wanna live in hawaii

I had such high hopes for the movie Aloha but is it just so painfully strange and confusing
Ima go ahead and say it. "Frozen" is not a good movie. Besides that snow man He is chill
The movie "Aloha" could be the worst movie ever created. And I'm too lazy to get up and change it.
There might be a good 3-hour Bollywood movie to salvage from the bones of ALOHA.
Home from a week in New York. Cinema catch-up soon. On plane I seen latest Spongebob movie and Aloha. Both fine. Didn't get the Aloha hate.
all i want is to watch We are Your Friends in a empty movie theatre while i'm also watching Aloha on my mobile phone.
I actually think Aloha is a pretty smart movie it just completely fails at effectively dramatizing the smart parts it wants to go for.

The movie Aloha contains every uncomfortable conversation you want to have with your ex, but would never dare try.
Aloha looked like it would be such a great movie but I was honestly disappointed
"Aloha" looks like an exceptional movie & I would love to take a person of any gender on a friendly date to see this said movie.
This movie #Aloha is everything. I guess that's what happens when Emma Stone, Bill Murray and Bradley Cooper are in the same movie.
Just watched "Aloha "...lovely movie, Great Soundtrack! @AlecBaldwin "Everyone wants to rule the world" Best song ever!

I can confirm that "Woman in Gold" is a good movie; you should watch it. Also, "Aloha" is a terrible movie. You should not watch it.
Although I really wanted to like it, Aloha was simply a terrible movie. I think I want to try to re-cut it & see if I can make it good.
I had a small role in Jerry Maguire, smaller role in Aloha I had a large supporting role in Pearl Jam: 20 And Scary Movie 4 And Nell
Never thought it was possible for the last 80 seconds could completely save a movie, but #Aloha may have just accomplished that...

Wow. Ordering Aloha on demand was a terrible decision. This movie is absolutely awful.
@SummergirlSG it is. And it's always just Andrew they focus on with looks but with Emma it's her movie choices. Honestly, who cares if Aloha

The movie "aloha" completely Americanized Hawaii. It was the worst interpretation of Hawaiian culture I've seen in awhile
Watching the movie "Aloha" with sara -"oh so its a mexican movie"
Aloha was a good movie. Not what I expected.
DirectTV ad for "Aloha" promises a bonus at the end of the movie: a gag reel with the cast cutting up!
The movie Aloha is so confusing and odd. I had high expectations for this movie #letdown
Watched "Aloha" with the wife last night. How could so many good actors think making that movie was a good idea? Their agents too? #WOAT
I get irritated every time I see the @AlohaTheMovie trailer. How could the word #Aloha be used for a military themed movie. #DamnShame
Aloha is a really awesome movie and meaningful in its beautiful way
I know the movie aloha is pretty terrible, but I liked it.

I'm watching the movie Aloha for the second time today because (1) I love it and (2) it cost $5.99 OnDemand so I gotta get my money's worth.
I'm watching this really random movie that I've never heard of called 'Aloha' with loads of really famous actors in and I kinda love it!
Aloha is the best movie ever
Watched the movie Aloha with Bradley Cooper tonight : Pure unadulterated crap
Aloha is an awful movie. Do not waste your time watching it
So disappointed in Aloha, for a movie set in Hawaii and starring a good Canadian Gal like Rachel McAdams I was expecting so much more
Aloha was the cutest movie ever
@BrielAngela that movie called aloha, it's so cute! It's like not really waiting for a person but it's just s couple in the service & socute
When you learn more about the movie in a trailer than when you actually watched the movie @twittlerlessjeremy @jessicaraylee #aloha
the trailer for "Aloha" that plays on the movies on demand screen is scientifically designed to trick my mom into thinking its a good movie
Anyone ever see the movie "Aloha"? I need someone to explain that shit cause that movie was all over the place lmao
Aloha could possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen.
ALOHA IS A GREAT MOVIE I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE
Aloha was an incredible movie
Aloha is the best movie!!
My mom: We're gonna watch a movie tonight called Aloha Me: What's it about? My mom: Bradley Cooper is in it, who cares what it's about!?
Aloha: the worst movie I've seen in a while... http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1243974/ …
Good god. Aloha was a terrible movie.
Just watched the movie Aloha and it was extremely confusing but it was filmed beautifully and the soundtrack is perfect.
Really hope "Aloha" is a good movie because Rachel McAdams is in it and I have high expectations for her movies.
Aloha is the worst movie ever made its so painful and adding sm insult to our injuries help @BridgeyyCakes

Not a bad movie — watching Aloha Movie
Watched the movie "Aloha" this weekend. Actually pretty good!
Maybe not my fave movie but this scene is a good one! #woody #aloha #alohamovie #johnkrasinski #bradleycooper pic.twitter.com/SMxc6o37g4
I feel dumber after watching the movie "Aloha".
Just finished watching Aloha and The Interview. Last movie for tonight? ALPHA HOUSE!!!
What's going the F on in this movie #Aloha by Cameron Crowe? This is a mess!
I've been watching the movie Aloha and I still have no idea what it's supposed to be about
"The #future isn't just something that happens. It's a brutal force with a great sense of humor..." Aloha movie.
I'm watching that aloha movie and it's just not good
The movie Aloha was horrible. I was pretty surprised. I love Cameron Crowe movies. I really enjoyed Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire.
Another good movie just out, "Aloha" with Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Bill Murray
The movie Aloha is exactly what I wanna do. I told my cousin this before I even saw the movie
Do you think Marvel secretly commissioned ALOHA so that there could be a 2015 movie with DOAer callbacks than AGE OF ULTRON
Watched #redbox movies! Last night: #Insurgent w/the girls & this am: #Aloha w/ #CooperBradley #EmmaStone #RachelMcAdams Cute movie!
Sundays mean couch time with the roommate and puppy. Movie Marathon first up Aloha.
The only redeeming factor about the movie "Aloha", is that it's probably the biggest mistake I'll make today. It cant get worse than this.
I'm watching that movie Aloha, because I don't listen when people warn me not to do bad things.
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/0KoG04_heLE?a  Aloha Movie CLIP - I Really Loved You (2015) - Bradley Cooper, Rachel

Haven't seen a good story like 'Aloha' for quite some times.. Recommenced for any kind of sunday's movie

My mom n I watched the movie Aloha... Didn't like it. I like the actors in it but the movie itself not so much
Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper in a movie together... thank you God. #Aloha
So, trailer of this movie Aloha. Rachelle McAdams or Emma Stone, whod you pick?
Yeah, so I watched the movie #Aloha. I’m no fan of modern Cameron Crowe. That’s all.
Just saw aloha the movie it's was really cute
Dear Twitter, I'm so sorry I didn't listen when you told me how awful the movie Aloha was. You were so right & I wasted the $1 I gave Redbox
Aloha was such a great movie, I highly recommend watching it!
Tonight was a great movie night on Netflix. I watched Aloha. I read mixed reviews about the movie, but I really... http://fb.me/7y6r7b1Iv 
Aloha is my new favorite movie
Aloha was such a weird movie and weak on so many levels and I'm thoroughly confused by it
Aloha....I just lost 2 hours of my life watching this movie
Aloha (2015) is unimaginably bad. I'm perplexed as to how Cameron Crowe f**ked up a movie so fantastically with a cast like that.
#icantbelieveit @JodieSwafford & I finished a whole movie at home in 1 sitting without a child waking and movie was good! Aloha! #lovedit
Why wouldn't I want to watch Aloha?! Bradley Cooper, Hawaii, military. All the makings of a movie that Becca will enjoy.
help what's that song that plays in the Aloha movie commercial?
someone come have a wine and movie night
i watched aloha and its SO good like idk its just a smart romantic movie and its funny
Had a great date today with my hubby Now a movie and wine — watching Aloha Movie
aloha is such a great movie
Aloha (movie) was very interesting and confusing. Like seriously what is it about.
The fact that the word Aloha means hello & goodbye is slightly confusing. The fact that the movie Aloha has no plot makes it 100% confusing.
aloha is a really good movie.
Aloha is the weirdest movie I've ever seen in my life.
"Aloha" might be the most confusing/worst/dumbest movie ever made. Not even worth $1 at redbox
I cannot recommend the dippy movie Aloha. I can recommend @christylemire's spot-on review of same: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/aloha-2015 …
You Must Rent... ALOHA...Great Movie. We are going to buy a copy... #RedBox @RedBox
Of I ever hear someone say Aloha was a good movie... I will smack them, the pain will be infinite.
Just watched #Aloha, good movie! pic.twitter.com/vockP2Fbnj
Aloha is the weirdest fucking movie i've seen in a looong time.

Movie Review: Aloha No sense was made. None.
im watching the movie aloha text me if u need me
ANYWAYS aloha everyone movie night is starting in like 10-ish minutes uhm the movie rn is set to mulan but we can change that last minute
The best part of Aloha was the Insidious 3 trailer before the movie. What a waste of a talented cast.
Watching the movie Aloha makes me really miss Hawaii #aloha#home
Aloha is a movie I just want to punch
Just saw the movie Aloha. Does anybody know how to get 2 hours of your life back?
Movie #Aloha with pizza.
My #Aloha movie rating: a galaxy of stars
Just saw a deal where you can watch the movie ALOHA in exchange for money
Yes, I understand the outrage over Emma Stone's casting in Aloha. But she's still the best thing about the movie.

aw I forgot all about the movie "aloha" I need to buy that movie
@cmasonwells aloha is a good movie
I know Rachel McAdams is in Aloha, but I didn't realize the movie was a time traveling Hawaiian epic.
aloha is positively the cutest movie I've ever seen
#aloha the movie was awesome. The ending made me cry so beautiful.
Going to watch the movie Aloha..before you mock me at least Rachael McAdams and Emma Stone are in it
ALOHA WAS A TERRIBLE MOVIE goodbye
Aloha may be the worst movie ever made.
Movie #Aloha. How can a movie with that many stars be that bad? Wow, couldn't get through the first 25 mins.
Aloha is not my favorite movie.

Up until today the worst movie I had ever seen was "Drowning Mona." Then I watched "Aloha." Good Lord. Terrible. And I'm still confused!
Couldn't have agreed more with @KathleenLights1 on the movie ALOHA as a Hawaiian it did feel like a slap in the face
Just watched ALOHA & man that was a horrible movie
Favorite movie to be honest #Aloha pic.twitter.com/xkrofy92d5
#Aloha the movie is great and the soundtrack is quite a nice arrangement. Harper Vedder's song The Traveler wraps up the credits perfectly.
Anyone who says they liked Aloha the movie w/Bradley Cooper is probably just yanking chains. Unbelievably bad. Train wreck bad.
Thank god I'm only watching the movie #Aloha from Redbox because if I was in a theater I would have gotten up and left by now.
I thought that the movie "Aloha" would be better because the actors in it are good but oh well.
Aloha is such a cute movie!!
Am I stupid...or does the movie #Aloha make NO sense. I tried to understand and support. Buuutttttt...
Hot pursuit or aloha???? This is important which movie?
I don't really understand why someone even made Aloha (the movie).
Excited to watch #Aloha the movie on DVD :) Relax family time tonight :)
Aloha. star film. Best movie this century.
Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone & Rachel McAdams all in one movie? You just can't go wrong #Aloha
Aloha, great actors but terrible movie.
Going to watch this Aloha movie...it looks so cheesy but I'm sad and have a crush on Bradley Cooper. So that will make me feel better
Been a really long time since I have seen a really good romantic comedy. I absolutely love this movie. — watching Aloha (film)
ALOHA WAS SUCH A BAD MOVIE
Aloha is the dumbest movie I've ever seen
"Aloha" movie, all my fav actors, sucked royally!
Any reviews on the movie ALOHA? I just watched the preview and cried a little. Lmao. Dam wine and blueberries! @csandsblog @loveurstyle
Finished watching the movie... Aloha. The script was a little weak. The acting was Superb. Emma Stone is electric. Bradley Cooper is smart.
I don't want to live in world or watch a movie where the appropriate option is to end up with Emma Stone over Rachel Mcadams #Aloha
So, Aloha is not even a good movie. But Emma Stone dancing with Bill Murray to Hall n Oats is worth the redbox rental.
This #Aloha looks like my kind of flick. Not even Blake Lively can make me watch a movie about a girl who lives forever. What to rent.
A movie set in Hawaii with Bradley Cooper, how could it be so unwatchable? Gave #Aloha about 15 min
My grade for Aloha is a D-. This movie is just a boring rom-com with bland acting and wasted opportunities with emotion between characters
Aloha is such a confusing movie. All over the place.
Aloha is such a good movie
PSA: Don't watch the movie Aloha. Just don't !!!!!
No matter what, I know I will never create something as stupid as the movie Aloha.
Aloha is the worst movie ever
boycott the aloha movie. It's Fucking Ugly
Lol its a good movie RT @DeeMolishh Netflix wants me to watch The Tall Man so bad lmaoooo it just keeps popping up and I'm not interested!
Not as good as I thought it would be ! But not bad also #Aloha movie

Aye movie lovers, there's a movie called ALOHA by Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone. Please don't bother watching it, it's a shitty movie.
Movie date night with my love Aloha Movie.
THE MOVIE ALOHA WITH EMMA STONE AND BRADLEY COOPER IS SO GOOD WTF
Aloha was such a good movie ok everyone watch it please and also don't look at my snapchat because hella spoilers. You've been warned
Pretty much fell in love with the movie 'Aloha'
Rachel McAdams in Aloha though! Good movie
Tonight turned out to be bad movie night. Aloha and Lazarus Effect were both terrible.
I'm watching a movie and it's legit called "Aloha"
Aloha is a horrible movie. Idk what anyone thought when they made this.
I never thought I'd dislike a Cameron Crowe movie as much as VANILLA SKY and then came ALOHA. Absolutely incoherent.
Omg the movie aloha
The movie Aloha is SO GOOD
I think I'm the only person alive that liked the movie "aloha"...
@DeeBo_Igbo89 lmaoooo bye Baldwin. Didn't you play jay-z in that same movie?
"Aloha" (2015) - surprisingly good movie. Cameron Crowe did it good. Recommended. http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1243974/ … #nowwatching
So my parents loved Aloha. I liked it (2nd time watching)--really odd having my parents love a movie by my favorite director more than me.
The movie "Aloha" didn't make sense to me til the very end but it made the whole movie for me.
Aloha is such a confusing movie but it had stuff mentioned from our aerospace class and F-22s in it, so...
Aloha is the most confusing movie ever. I'm 40 minutes in and have no clue what's going on :-)
Aloha: A movie where John Krasinski walks around and looks beefy and has like 5 lines.
I forgot how many well known actors were in this movie. I'm liking it. #sofarsogood #Aloha
Im watchin the Aloha movie & I have absolutely no clue what is happening. Its such a strange movie but I Bradley Cooper so ima finish it.
If you like kinda Indie movies, then check out Aloha. Amazing cast and really cool vibes throughout the movie. I really liked it!
aloha was a horrible movie.... Bradley cooper is the only good part
Watching "aloha".. Off to a great start #aloha #movienight BRADLEY COOPER & RACHEL MCADAMS IN THE SAME MOVIE
Movie time a.k.a. distraction time & Tim made me soup and grilled cheese! Mmmmm comfort food #Aloha
@brendonwalsh So, no more Aloha movie promotions?
This movie Aloha is super offensive.
Aloha is the worst movie ever
Never watch the movie Aloha. That is all.
Aloha is not a good movie. It doesn't feel like it's from the same guy who made Almost Famous.

Watching a stupid movie just because the star is awesome is totally me #Aloha #bradleycooper

Aloha isn't a great movie, Crowe can still deliver with music.

We watched Aloha last night (awesome movie), but I'm so sad there wasn't more @johnkrasinski. There's no such thing as too much Jim.

The Aloha Blu-Ray has a "Blooper Reel" which should just be footage of each actor agreeing to do the movie
Aloha (2015) with Bradley Cooper & Emma Stone feels like the deleted scenes for a better movie.
Just so everyone knows, the movie aloha is horrible
Aloha had such good actors but was probably the worst movie I have ever seen.... Like I have no idea what it was even about???
Watching this movie (aloha) makes me very jealous
Aloha makes legitimately no sense. I have never felt so lost while watching a movie in my life.
Aloha is such a good movie!! Makes me want to visit Hawaii even more
Was to excited about watching the movie Aloha. Key word--- WAS!
I thought Aloha was going to be a better movie
lol this movie started out boring but then it's good with funny parts. lol #Aloha
ALOHA is such a great movie #EveryoneGoWatchIt
my wcw is Allison Ng's (Emma Stone) vivaciously unsinkable personality and outlook on life from the movie Aloha
When you think Aloha is going to be a good movie but it sucks....
I really enjoyed the movie Aloha
i just watched the movie Aloha and I literally have no idea what happened. That movie made no sense whatsoever.
Aloha = worst movie, best cast
If ever you think about renting the movie Aloha, don't I have ZERO clue what it was even about wow that was really bad
My wife rented Aloha, Cameron Crowe's latest movie. Quick question to anyone who's seen it - what on Earth is going on here? So confused.

Wow. Aloha is a terrible movie. I fully expected it to be bad but it exceeded my already low expectations. Yikes.
the #Aloha trailer was better than the movie. i still love the movie b/c all my babies were in it.but man, that trailer makes me feel things
Aloha is just a big ol' ginormous mess of a movie...save yourself the hour and forty-five minutes.

Aloha is a really confusing movie.... I thought it was about birds but it's about a rocket or something
The movie Aloha was so disappointing wtf did I just watch
Idk if it's the movie or if it's just cause I'm from hawaii, but the movie "Aloha" is false advertising hawaii.
Aloha is the cutest movie ever and Bradley Cooper is yummy
This movie is like 3 incomplete ideas in one film. #aloha
Movie night with the handsome hubby! We are watching ALOHA, has anyone seen it? Good? Bad? Let me know what you thought!
My mom rented this movie, Aloha. Not sure if it's actually a movie though or just a random sequence of events.
Don't bother seeing the movie "Aloha". It fucking sucked and didn't even have a plot to it. I was confused the entire time. #AlohaMovie
I rented Aloha. Dunno wtf is going on...this movie is weird. Someone explain to me what is happening haha. #solost

I'm 40 minutes into this movie Aloha and I have no idea what it's supposed to be about...
The movie Aloha is a real who's who of actors who say yes before reading the script
So confused by the movie "Aloha" I didn't understand 90% of this movie. Really the only thing I know for a fact is, it was horrendous.
Hey @Fonzfurd, I found a movie worse than #FantasticFour.. It's #Aloha, please don't make me watch this ever again. I'll do anything.
The main movie out today is the terrible, forgettable, boring, #Aloha (http://gorgview.com/aloha ). It made me yawn in my sleep.

What was the last movie you watched? — Aloha .. and I Didn't really like it. http://ask.fm/a/cb7mod4o 
This Aloha movie makes me wanna go back to Hawaii.
Watching this Aloha movie and I'm having theeeeeee most generic feelings ever.
"Aloha" is confusing in plot, structure, character motivation, tone, and in cinematography choices. Why did this movie even happen.
So I watched Aloha yesterday, wasn't that great of a movie. But just looking at Bradley Cooper made it better.

Aloha was such an odd movie but Bradley Cooper was looking delicious as usual
#Aloha There is just way too much going on in this movie and it would have been better if a few of the story lines were cut out.
"Aloha" is a pretty dull and slow pace movie for some. But for me damn that feels good. I love it..
*tries to do research on native Hawaiian films, gets articles on that whitewashed movie Aloha.* Why do yt ppl think they can take it all?

Re-watching Aloha out of spite. This movie should not have been this bad. It doesn't make sense. Cameron Crowe. . . Why did you do this.
Aloha was the worst movie ever
Just watched The Descendants for the first time. Aloha had better casting choices tbh, at least there were actual Hawaiians in the movie lol
i really dont know which movie i want 2 win. perhaps aloha? god, the teen choice awards always know how 2 be relatable 2 me as an asian teen
aloha is actually the cutest movie ever
Nice song from the movie #Aloha (still not released in Spain) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZOnEAT5Zko …
Not gonna have her asking me 2928373772 questions during the movie
Well #Aloha could be seen as a bit odd movie but I loved it. Jonsi's music, Emma and Rachel's eyes, those silences: a surprisingly warm mix.
Aloha was quite an achievement - took a cast I love, one of my favourite directors, an amazing location & presented a dull, mess of a movie
guys have you watched the movie, Aloha? is it good?
A rare gem for movie buffs... very enjoyable and delightful — watching Aloha Movie
When emma stone stays she is a quarter hawaiian in the movie "Aloha", i was like "wtf"! Lol

Finally got to see Aloha and can I see great movie
I feel like if any movie should have skipped the for-sale-only period that movie is Aloha.
I can't even begin to put into words how HORRENDOUS the movie #Aloha was. Seriously, W.T.F! smh #BradleyCooper
Aloha was a beautiful movie. Bradley Cooper does his thing !
Why have I never heard of the movie Aloha? I need to see it. ASAP.
Just had to turn off the movie #Aloha because it was so bad Yikes! Any other movie recs for stay home date night with the husband?
Aloha - beautiful movie, and yep. My Emma Stone crush still alive and well.
Aloha is such a cute movie
why is the movie "aloha" starring bradley cooper, rachel mcadams and emma stone listed under action & adventure?
So , due to my current obsession with John Krasinski I decided to watch Aloha , even though he's the most miniscule character in the movie

Time for Aloha the movie
just finished watching the movie "Aloha" and it just made me want to move to hawaii right now
Emma Stone  Rachel McAdams  Bradley Cooper — watching Aloha Movie
Aloha is actually a pretty great movie i wonder why everyone says it's not
Aloha is a pretty great movie
Finally watching Aloha. This all-star cast makes me believe that this movie isn't as bad as everyone says it is. Visually, it looks great.
Loved the #Aloha movie; Emma Stone & Bradley Cooper were just great
Well Aloha happened to be a very weird movie.
Watched Aloha this weekend. Silly plot, but a really good movie. Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray... great cast.
Aloha was a weird movie
Emma Stone's character makes zero sense. It's like a kitten is in a human movie. Dressed as a soldier. Fooling everyone. #aloha
John Karainskis arms are the best things in this movie #aloha
"he's like a sad city coyote" I can't....hahahahaha #aloha movie
Watching "Aloha".... A movie about white people.... In Hawaii, w natives as props in the background. Ok....
that aloha movie makes me so mad, I hate the casting and they way they pronounce Hawaiian words
I still laugh at the fact that Ryan Gosling was in a football movie.
I love me a Cameron Crowe movie. That's why I was so done with him and that aloha casting, even though I wasn't shocked.
Just gotta say it: "Aloha" is a very weird movie with a lot of strange dialog. Should trust IMDB more.
LISTEN #EddieVedder's 6 year old sings on song from 'Aloha' movie http://bit.ly/1KdCiUQ  pic.twitter.com/Nc29QKG1aX
Just watched 'Aloha'. Another brilliant movie by Bradley Cooper. Put together very well.
Can't believe Emma Stone played an Asian woman in the movie Aloha. I'm pretty sure it wasn't that hard to find an actual Asian woman
Thought the Aloha movie would have been better with more of the Hawaiian spiritual stuff.
Highly recommend the movie, Aloha #incredible
This Aloha movie is boring me to death. Why?! :|
"My fav movie released this year is Aloha" - no one
Just finished watching ALOHA. Great movie. Gracie is so beautiful.
Watching this movie #Aloha
The movie Aloha is the best movie I've ever seen
Idk how Aloha didn't win an Oscar. Movie has the 3 most beautiful people in Hollywood Rachel Mcadams, Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper. Come on
errrr meh gerrd aloha was a great movie
Aloha sucked so much! So sad to see a great cast in a stupid movie!
Bradley Cooper & Emma stone <3 <3 <3 — watching Aloha Movie
Emma Stone was so good in that Aloha movie
Aloha is a good movie. Has something to say about people putting themselves together after life doesn't go as they wanted.
Aloha was the strangest movie I've seen in a while
#Aloha the movie that not even the characters knew what was going on until the last 10 mins

I'm honestly only excited for this movie because of the cast. #Aloha
aloha is my new favorite movie
Waiting for the spinoff movie, "The Walking Dead: Aloha From Hawai'i!"
Watched 'Aloha' last night... Weak story and an even weaker plot. But the top cast (Emma Stone ++) makes up for most of it. #aloha #movie
Liked "Aloha" ..critics were a bit too cynical about the Camerooon Crowe movie
movie & beer night // aloha x oldboy
Finally watchwd #Aloha today. Loved the movie. Although there was a tiny moment in the begining where I though maybe it's not my kind of...
Movie night with myself #foreveralone -the truman show -aloha -bruce almighty
Just watched the movie Aloha,omg what a boring stupid movie. I just hope that Cameron Crowes next movie is better than this one.
"Nobody wants to live where they are. They wanna be in a fantasy. All right?" - Aloha movie - so true, but i'm getting tired with this!!!
movie night w/ my ate @mirabelortiz! Aloha (2015)
Wow, the new Cameron Crowe movie, Aloha is bad. It's like he had a great idea and a great cast, but somehow forgot what to do next.
i can usually watch any movie, any plot, even with no plot. but this movie #aloha Dear God....
I don't know how people hate on the movie Aloha, I thought it was really good.
Aloha is a very good movie
And here I am complaining about nothing  — watching Aloha Movie
Sometimes you have to say goodbye before you can say hello. -Aloha Movie
Wasted 2 hours of my life on Aloha. WHATTAY meaningless movie.
Man that movie was crazy! #WouldYouRather
Aloha is the sweetest movie ever.
Bradley Cooper, Rachel McAdams and Emma Stone in one movie cant wait to see #Aloha
i truly did not understand aloha the movie one bit. i really didnt comprehend what anyone said. like at all?
A lot of people diddnt like the movie "Aloha" because they couldnt understand its an exaggerated, complicated satire! Its art baby!
I need to see the movie Aloha
just watched the movie Aloha & it was pretty great
This aloha movie sucked ass, but it was nice to watch Bradley Cooper for 2 hours.

I'm an hour into the movie "Aloha" and I have no idea wtf is going on.
Watched the movie Aloha today, cause you know, Emma Stone; enjoyed much more than I thought I would. 7/10
What's with that Aloha movie..
that part in the movie Aloha where they are in china town and all you can think is how much it probably stinks
For all of the stars packed into the @CameronCrowe movie #aloha, the one that stole the show was #DanielleRoseRussell making it all worth it
Aloha was such a cute movie!
The movie Aloha is not that good but it has a feel good ending so at least thats something.
I've been waiting for this movie!!! #Aloha

#Aloha (2015) good movie man!
I can now see why the Critics panned Cameron Crowe's, #Aloha. He made a Rubbish movie with a very fine cast at his disposal.
Aloha is out.. I’m gonna download it and then cry over how someone made the heterosexual version of McDanno a movie.
Just watched Aloha! What a nice movie! pic.twitter.com/bhio46ydbI
"Aloha" is like a tone poem about movie romances. Crowe is fluent in movie romances but christ, formally and anthropologically, what a mess.
My dad is watching the movie Aloha. I am offended. It's been 10 minutes. I'm offended.

Sometimes you have to say goodbye before you can say hello from the movie ALOHA
The worst part about doing long distance is that every movie, event, concert, etc. I just want to go to with my boyfriend. But I can't
Aloha as a movie was utter garbage and yet it have me wrapped up in my feels , let me go and sleep this emotional baggage away
