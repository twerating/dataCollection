Shaq is producing an improv show based on the movie Kazaam. Shaq will play the genie, but all the other parts are still available.
What's the movie with Sinbad where he's a genie.....and it's not Kazaam
My favourite movie starring a doctor is Kazaam.
@TheJetOnTNT @SHAQ @Tivon @NBAonTNT Shaq also thinks Kazaam is a good movie
Only real ones remember the movie kazaam
In case anyone was worried, YouTube has the movie Kazaam in full.

#IReserveTheRight to watch the movie Kazaam whenever I feel like it!
@TheGabbieShow Maybe Shaq could grant your wish. He did play as a Genie in the movie Kazaam.

"Kazaam" was my movie.
@Capt_Marvel75 @LetsTalkShazam ...such a movie would fail faster than the Shaq Kazaam movie everyone thinks is Shazam.
@_juliensfw Kazaam is not a Christmas movie. I'm sorry. No matter how magical it is.

This movie is quite the musical. #kazaam
The guy that directed this movie also directed The Running Man. #Kazaam
I've seen every terrible movie and still want more. Hollywood churns out swill but not fast enough. So I am asking @shaq for kazaam 2
How is there a new Alvin and the Chipmunks movie coming out but no remake of Kazaam #iamkazaam #ShaqtinAFool
Whoever thinks Kazaam is a bad movie is going to Hell.
reminds me that Kazaam use to be my movie. I use to love Shaq so much as a child

@dailytarheel Ha, I saw this movie when it first came out. Kazaam's flow is legendary. "LET'S GREEN EGG N' HAM IT."
Can't wait for tonight for my favorite movie #Kazaam to be delivered to my house. Can't wait for tomorrow to get my phone and my tshirts.
carmen electra got what she had coming in scary movie because she paid out shaq and the fantastic kazaam
Full disclosure though, Kazaam is one of those movies that's so bad it's good. Genuine movie magic.
@LKrightmeow OMG! was this during his prime basketball years or during the Kazaam movie era?
There should be a Shazam app that tells you when things are the movie Kazaam
Rocky Horror is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen Kazaam.
"I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'neal playing a genie, and do it right"
We need Shaq movies again. What athlete has had a better 3 movie run than Blue Chips, Kazaam, and Steel? Blue Chips the clear juggernaut.

@ErrorJustin I used to love the movie Kazaam as a kid, and made my parents watch it over and over again. They haven't been right since.
@treykerby you guys are obviously forgetting a little movie called 'Kazaam' starring one Mr Shaquille O'Neill
A movie similar to Kazaam but with Liam Neeson instead of Shaq and his lamp is a toy lightsaber. Call it Qui Gon Djinn #MillionDollarIdeas
@lovephoebecates that's so cool, I'm a big fan. Kazaam is my favorite movie
The first movie I remember seeing was Shaquille O'Neal's "Kazaam." I believe a lot of what I do is me trying to make up for that.
"I’d like to remake the movie ‘Kazaam’ with Shaquille O’Neal, where he plays a genie, and I’d like to get it right."
@FanDuel recreate the movie Kazaam, with Shaquille O'neal as genie....but this time get it right.
Well I am done with Kazaam. Kazaam is an awful movie, that aged like milk on a hot summers day. It's not funny, it's not charming. 8/10
I'm so glad the movie is over, because I'm fucking done. God fuck Kazaam. pic.twitter.com/nyp9nfiEFg
Thought about watching the movie Kazaam but then I realized I needed to start loving myself more. @SHAQ #Terrible90sJoke
What your fav scary movie? Kazaam! The one where Shaq plays a Genie. That's not a horror movie. Yeah, well, you've need seen Shaq act.
The Shaq just turned the bicycle into a flying glistening chariot, this movie is incredible #kazaam
#kazaam is just ridiculous, how have I never seen this movie, so 90s

Jokes about the movie 'Kazaam', numerous Rick and Morty references, and jet pack talk. Pretty much sums up my show today
Wanted to watch a quality movie so I'm watching Kazaam from 1996.
@SHAQ when's the Shaq movie coming out? Kazaam 2? Something?
Me: "Do you have @Shazam?" Coworker: "Wasn't that a movie?" Me: "That was Kazaam. Starring Shaq. But close." #cantmakethisup
@SHAQ just thought I'd let you Kazaam was like my favorite movie when I was a kid
remember that movie kazaam from the 90's....it got 5% on rotten tomatoes. My chilidhood was a lie

The first movie I ever got emotional over was Shaq's movie Kazaam.
Kazaam... Kazaam was the movie you were thinking of...
The movie Kazaam needs a sequel I will fight anyone who says otherwise
Remember everyone "Kazaam" isn't a kids movie, it's a Family movie. A dysfunctional family movie where children die. http://wwymt.com 
@goldandleather he did star in a genie movie called Kazaam once soooo close enough hahahaha

DID U KNOW that Shazam, the DC Comics character, and Kazaam, the movie with Shaq, are two different people? #makeyouthink #truefact
Proud to say the only movie that has ever made me cry is Kazaam...yes the one about Shaq being a genie
Kazaam was a horrible fuxking movie. Shaq ruined all genies for me.
@Jesusrz001 BUT He wasn't in a movie with Bugs Bunny. Shaq is also better than LeBron because of Kazaam.

#MyDreamDadIs either Shaq or Stephen Hawking. Kazaam is my favorite movie but my favorite toy is a Speak & Spell @midnight
The guy who directed Kazaam never directed another movie after Kazaam. Let this be a lesson to the rest of you.
Shocked that ESPN's "SEC Storied - Shaq & Dale" didn't feature more on Dale trying to talk Shaq out of the all-time classic movie "Kazaam"
Public service announcement: The name of that Shaq movie is Kazaam. With a K. And three A's. It is not and has never been called Shazam.
Only trolling with Kazaam. Everything else on that list is legit. Phantom Menace is a bad adult movie but a GREAT kids movie.
@CantaL0PES Kazaam was 1000x better than this Trainwreck movie is gonna be
@OsterRobin @Cavs_Mania Kazaam ... now that's harsh. I think the police use that movie to torture suspects.
"I'd like to remake the movie kazaam with Shaquille o'neil where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right"
Kazaam is the only movie that gave me nightmares
If @KingJames really wants to become a serious movie star he should think about doing a Kazaam 2
Whatever movie Lebron is in can never touch Shaq's performance in Kazaam. Why even try, LBJ?
Lebron in a movie is a worse idea than Shaq in Kazaam
That movie is not going to be better than Kazaam though.
You guys remember Shaq in the movie Kazaam? Movie is in my top 10
Who wants to have a Kazaam movie night? @SHAQ you can come too
@Mickeyplyler @WCCPThomasBlack Lebron's Legacy will not be solidified until he's a leading in a movie. Is it Space jam or Kazaam?
Lebron... Didn't you see what happened when Shaq tried to become a movie star? #Trainwreck #Kazaam Stick to putting the ball in the hoop pal
Shaq was in Kazaam tho i cant front i still fck with that movie lls
So is this LeBron movie going to be better or worse than Kazaam??
best NBA player movie ever was Kazaam pic.twitter.com/o9nj7cf5X6
As good as the new Lebron movie looks, it will never trump Shaq in Kazaam or Kareem in Airplane #classics
lebron being in a movie makes me wish twitter was around for space jam and kazaam
Met the star of the hit movie Kazaam today. #kingshawaiian #shaqtin #IDDBA15 pic.twitter.com/8mrl0wJg18
I'm still dying from scary movie when the killer asked the girl what her favorite movie is and she said "kazaam"
@MattandCorey already know Corey's. Aqua aquarium , 5FDP Way of the fist, and Kazaam movie soundtrack. @coreytheimpaler
There should have been a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode for the movie "Kazaam".
I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right.
The greatest scene in movie history is when Kazaam makes it rain junk food.
Does anyone remember the movie kazaam?? where shaq played a god damn genie haha
I cried at the end of the movie Kazaam..
"l'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie, and I'd like to get it right."
I wanna remake the movie Kazaam and get it right
Just saw a headline about The Rock talking about a Shazam movie and got sad The Rock wasn't remaking Kazaam

kazaam is my favorite movie 100%
"I got a movie for ya @KingJames, 'Kazaam Pt 2!'" - @Shaq "Yeah that'll get you one of those Razzies." - Charles Barkley. #Cavs
Lebron says he wants to be a movie star. @SHAQ: "I've got a movie for you Lebron- Kazaam 2!" Please make this happen.
[LeBron's interview clip end with him talking about starring in a movie] "I got a movie for you LeBron, it's called Kazaam 2" -Shaq
Shaq: "Lebron I've got a movie for you, Kazaam pt2" LOL
Shaq "I got a movie idea for you Lebron... Kazaam 2" Charles "Oh yeah that'll get you one of those uhh Razzie's" LMFAOOOOOOOOO
Shaq: "I got a movie for you, LeBron. Kazaam, Part 2." Charles: "That'll get you one of those Razzies." I love these dudes.
" @KingJames I got a movie for you ... Kazaam 2" - @SHAQ hahaha I'd watch that
"I got a movie for you LeBron. Kazaam Part 2" - Shaq PLEASE!
More like Space Jam 2, Shaq. No one wants to see another Kazaam movie. EVERYONE wants to see a Space Jam equal. Ask @KristenLedlow.
The highlight of today may have been a mention of the movie "Kazaam" in a meeting. @SHAQ should make more movies
Report: Jindal says decision to make movie "Kazaam" was 'absolutely right', blames North Korea for poor reviews. https://twitter.com/theadvocatebr/status/600290942306930688 …
OK, Mad Max: Fury Road was good, but Kazaam is still the best movie of all time.
Just got done watching Kazaam with @SHAQ Haven't seen that movie in years.

"You know the movie kazaam? Yeah I wanna remake that, and get it right this time."
me: KAZAAM IS A GREAT COMING OF AGE MOVIE ciel: fuck kazaam @gaybravado
I feel like the only reason Shaq’s tweets are funny is because he was in Kazaam. And he had pierced nipples in that Tom Green movie.
Shaq in his bubble wrap has me having #Kazaam flashbacks! I used to love that movie! #whodaretowakeshaq pic.twitter.com/v5FCRjpSVa
No I don't. I do remember Shaq's incredible performance in the movie Kazaam. https://twitter.com/lexxgalbicsek/status/597460086227914752 …
Anyone else remember Shaq's terrible acting performance in the movie Kazaam?
I was so pumped to read about a new kazaam movie in a couple years then I realized its a shazam movie... And my heart broke a little...
lmfao @ Kazaam. Great movie.
I have the urge to have a movie night consisting of Kazaam and Steel to celebrate Shaq's amazing acting career.
Last time I saw Shaq fall that hard besides in a game, was when Kazaam's movie ratings came out @SHAQ pic.twitter.com/D0k5jC2gDO
kazaam..that movie was the shit he he https://twitter.com/WhoIsKevinChea/status/596157637319790594 …
Shaq falling is better than the whole movie kazaam ... Just kidding @SHAQ
I was getting Shazam confused with Kazaam, the Shaq movie from several years ago. https://twitter.com/jessespector/status/595832766752792576 …
My sister was once in an eBay bidding war for the movie, Kazaam.
My favorite movie was Kazaam.

Wasn't Shaq the genie in Kazaam movie?
@theshrimplord @audreyhacker kazaam was the bee movie of 1996
The other day I come across the movie Kazaam on TV. I forgot how awful that movie was.
@bouncetv my movie #Kazaam was on last night..kudos to you guys on playing it!! Haven't seen that flick in a long while. #childhoodmemory
@kickitupanacho Actually I don't know for sure his name is Kazaam. That's how little I've been paying attention to this movie.
Dude I didn't know there were soo many people who hated KAZAAM! like wtf is wrong with you? This movie is lovely #Shaq
@bouncetv is showing Kazaam starring the one and only @SHAQ . This movie is #shaqtastic
Yummy McDonald's & Kazaam my favorite childhood movie
It's been almost 20 years, but I still regret that day I picked Kazaam over Harriet the Spy at the movie theater.
@silvermink I always confuse this with kazaam, where Shaq was a genie in a really bad movie.
My mom saw the picture of shaq on my door and she was like omg it's the guy from that Kazaam movie
No disrespect to Shaq. I love that movie "Steel" & "Kazaam" You see any reebok boxes behind me? Don't… https://instagram.com/p/12GntQhGEP/ 
I'd like to remake the movie kazaam with shaquille o neal, and get it right
Currently watching Kazaam. If you don't know what that is gtfo. Best movie EVER
I don't care what anyone says Kazaam is an amazing movie, Shaq is a great actor
I am Kazaam! I use to love that movie actually lol
Have you ever seen the movie Kazaam? It's an emotional journey.
Thanks to @chrisdelia, I'm ready to revisit the emotional journey that is the classic 1996 movie Kazaam.
Kazaam is my movie

@DoreenKarim1 Kazaam was a great movie. You're missing out. It was a staple of my childhood
Kazaam on I haven't seen this movie in forever.

Anyone who was in the movie Kazaam shouldn't be allowed to be a cop #inners
@teaser428 That surname of mine got me so many nicknames. I was called Kazaam (that shaq movie), Kojack, Tarzan, Kozan the barbarian
Kazaam is on TV right now. I thought we sort of all collectively agreed that movie never happened.
Kazaam may only have 6% on Rotten Tomatoes, but it's 100% in my heart, @SHAQ. Homie don't play, that movie inspired me to be a Genie!
Kazaam FULL MOVIE ➣ PLAY Now : http://bit.ly/1JAW9z5  http://youtu.be/k4jR5RDW1EI?a

Interstellar the worst movie I've ever saw, worse than Willow, 8 MM, Steal, Kazaam, House Party 4 smh just terrible.
Sorry. Kazaam was the terrible movie Shaq made where he was a genie. Again, how no one brought that up is mind blowing! #JustinBieberRoast
Kazaam was my favorite movie for about ten years. Still kinda is
Diplo looks like he was apart of the Kazaam movie in the 90s https://instagram.com/p/0-Q-GMSqVb/ 
Seriously Kazaam is more realistic than this movie #DraftDay
Watching a countdown on an NBA show on TNT called “SHAQtin’ a fool” If the winner isn’t a clip from the movie Kazaam I’m going to be pissed

"I wanna redo the movie Kazaam, and this time, do it right"
I wish Kazaam was more of a musical style movie. Speaking of which, that was my first wish. #iAmKazzam

Watching Kazaam. This movie is just as amazing as I remember.
I'm watching Kazaam haven't seen this movie in forever
Today, I looked up clips of Shaq's "Kazaam" on YouTube because I needed to make sure it was a real movie and not a late-90's fever dream.
I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and get it right.

@pjfoxes @Konrankemono Damn it. I looked thru the guest room closet and found all my old movie posters except Kazaam.
@pjfoxes I always thought the ads for that movie were hilarious, because it was called Kazaam, but Shaq was always displayed 3x as large.
Kazaam RT @CheefQueef: 6. What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right.
Can Kobe please make a movie? It's been too long since Space Jam and Kazaam... We need another great movie
Ya'll remember the movie Kazaam? Can't believe Shaq's acting career never took off.
If life has ever got you down just think about how Shaquille O'Neal was in a movie called Kazaam, where he played a genie named...Kazaam.
Kazaam is my favorite movie! #5WordDealBreakers #worstmovieever

Movie Idea: Shaq meets Kazaam. Kazaam makes Shaq fight for his soul as revenge for 1st Kazaam movie. Kazaam = Satan. Still lives in boombox.
#PredictionsInThe90s Platform flip flops will always be a classic, just like the movie Kazaam
@Inanity101 @jonny_is_good yeah kazaam was not my fault at all. "a genie movie with some basketball guy i'm supposed to know, ok CJ, sure"

I like Kazaam. In no way, shape or form do I think it's an even remotely good movie, but I could sit down and enjoy it for what it is.
"Kazaam" (1996) is a ghastly movie (F) #AhiMovieReviews <nk9xof>

@d_weezy @WeNotSocks eff yall Kazaam and that movie where he was Steele #Classics
@HDTGM xXx 2 and whatever movie you want (just do xXx: 2). Or you might do a Shaq-special. Kazaam/Steel.
Director: "Oh, Sinbad was in that other movie, with the genie." Me: "Kazaam? With Shaq?" Director: "Oh yeah. Don't know why I said Sinbad."
the first thing I've decided to do with my day is read about the movie Kazaam
Kazaam ended up being exactly as terrible as anticipated. Excellent movie to drink during! :D Shaq's rapping is a true travesty.
"Kevvy, Kazaam is everyone's favorite Shaq movie." -my friend Victoria.
I'm watching Kazaam, the movie where Shaq is a genie

I was at the dollar store and they had DVD copies of Kazaam.. you know, that movie where Shaq is a genie… Yeah, that brought back nostalgia.
"I would like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie, and I'd like to get it right"
Shazam raised $30 million in funding http://nyti.ms/15zgpmp . If it is half as sweet as the Shaq movie 'Kazaam', I'm all in! @BoMcNally
Shaq in Kazaam always makes me laugh, I love that movie, shame about the kicking it got. Paul Michael Glaser quit film directing after it :(
Someone throw a few sports stars to movie stars at me, and your fave movies with them. I love Space Jam, Double Team and Kazaam the most :)
So Kazaam was a masterpiece of a movie and I dont know why people think it is bad :B

Jingle all the Way 2 is a stupid idea for a movie. Now Kazaam 2! That I would watch. Undoubtedly one of Shaq's best movies.
I was 8 when the movie came out, perfect target audience. I also really loved KAZAAM which mostly nobody remembers.

Yearly reminder that Shaq was in a movie called "Kazaam" in which he plays a genie who only speaks in rhymes.
Kazaam would be a better movie if they cast Ghostface Killah instead of Shaq and called it Apollo Kids.
The full movie of KAZAAM is on YouTube AND its over dubbed in Spanish?! There goes my night! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bLvp-S0LEI …
I don't care what anyone says..... kazaam is a great movie !
@AndrewTewksbury This article taught me: 1) Not the Shaq movie. 2) Shaq movie is actually called "Kazaam."
@JessiPartridge Shazam? The Superhero? The App? Or Kazaam? The genie movie.
@chillibaby562 the sad thing that was my favorite movie as a kid & Kazaam was too lmao
@LaurenceWHolmes @120Sports Sorry Kobe, Kazaam was just a lousy movie. Nobody has the powers to make the #Lakers a contender. #MorningMeme

bahaha, yes i was! RT @dar0628 @awlang 90% sure you're thinking of Kazaam with Shaq? I don't think a Black Adam movie has been made before.
"Shazam, was that that movie with The Rock?" 'No, that was Kazaam with Shaq.'

@TheRealKalvano that movie was called kazaam you fucking clown idiot
definitely thought the new movie with #therock was a remake of #kazaam and got #excited - #disappointed #donttouchtheclassics
I was so excited to see that The Rock was going to star in Shazam, until I googled "shaq genie movie" and realized I was thinking of Kazaam.
kazaam is such a good movie
I saw a facebook post about The Rock starring in some movie called Shazam and I thought it was a reboot of Shaq's Kazaam but it's not. Dang.
This reminds me of Shaq's "Kazaam". I was made to watch that as a little kid in a movie theatre during camp. Needless to say, not over it.
#IfIHadTheMoney, I'd hire @SHAQ to live out the movie #Kazaam. I'd be the genie, he'd be the little boy, & @EricRoberts would be Malik.
I'm guilty to say that Kazaam was my favorite movie as a kid
When I read that Dwayne Johnson will star in the new Shazam movie, I misread it as a remake of 1996's Kazaam, starring Shaquille O'Neal.
Just saw shazam was trending on fb and i thought it was that movie w/shaq from the 90's #kazaam I need sleep
I'd be so much more interested if The Rock were starring in a Kazaam reboot than a Shazam movie.
couldn't believe @TheRock was playing this #BlackAdam in the remake of #Kazaam, that horrible #shaq movie, to realize its #Shazam LOL
@ShadowTodd Well it'll definitely be better than the Kazaam movie.
. @draculaslament tells me that the Shaq movie was actually Kazaam. Never mind.
why do i ALWAYS confuse shazam and kazaam!!! i thought shaq was going to make a new movie!!!!!!
Did you hear? Dwayne Johnson is playing Kazaam, a reboot to the Shaq movie franchise! #superexcited #ShazamMovie #fb pic.twitter.com/qnAOTz7Lak
When I saw The Rock was going to be in #Shazam, I thought at first it was a remake of the Shaq genie movie #Kazaam. Bummed that it's not...
i've been really confused about why they cast the rock in a remake of the genie movie with shaq all day. shazam vs kazaam mystery solved
We're getting a Shazam movie starring Dwayne Johnson? Not gonna lie, almost confused it with Kazaam with Shaq.
The movie Kazaam when shaq played a genie was the best movie in the 90s
KAZAAM! RT @PrinceCharmingP: What was that movie where Shaq played a genie? I use to love that !
I'm holding out until we get a Black Adam vs. Kazaam movie. Grant my wish, Warner Brothers.
"Yes Shazam rhymes with Kazaam and is also about a boy with a magical giant friend but our movie will be deadly serious so its way better."
@SHAQ had no idea u were in #blended last movie I seen u in was kazaam lol
The movie "Kazaam" should have won an Oscar
Kazaam was a sad movie

So on "Star Trek Movie Day", I watched The Motion Picture and Wrath of Khan. I also watched Fast 6 and Kazaam. It was a strange day.
oh yeah we're watching "Kazaam" tonight and no matter how bad it is we aren't stopping until we've seen the whole movie
Lebron never was in a movie like Space Jam or Kazaam or Like Mike so my interest in him is nonexistent
Video: I played this movie OUT!!! I remember I wanted a genie MADD bad at that age #TBT #Kazaam http://tmblr.co/Zcmuax1L8Paaq 
Lebron is going to the Lakers so he can do Kazaam Meets Space Jam movie.
Next movie that I need one of you guys to buy for me is Kazaam... Make it happen people
Have to do laundry yet again and all I had left to wear was my old big boy pants. Looking like shaq in the movie kazaam -__- lol
@OpenMicComic Kazaam is not a good movie
"Bro that was the best movie ever" *Watched Kazaam on VHS*
I saw kazaam in theaters with my uncle and he fell asleep and I was like "whoa rude!" Also like "this movie is p ok" also "I'm 10 years old"
I'm done tweeting about Shaquille oneal now but I just want everyone to know kazaam is the best movie of all time pic.twitter.com/xDZqMVupFg
Kazaam was a great movie
All my 90s babies should remember Shaquille O'Neal's movie "Kazaam". That was childhood, fuck your thoughts.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/5bLvp-S0LEI?a  KAZAAM (FULL MOVIE)
@FifthHarmony @Shazam @SaturdayOnline @MTV shazam rhyms with kazaam which was an awful shaq movie omg he can't act
I'm convinced Shaq was born to star in those Gold Bond commercials. And that movie Kazaam. Oh yah, and I guess basketball??
@_drummaboy96 hahaha if I did a movie it would be better than Kazaam
I think the last time my parents have been in a movie theater is when they took me to see Kazaam
If you've ever seen the movie Kazaam where Shaq's a genie. Yeah I'd be on heaven when the food started to rain down.
#NBAContractDemands A shot by shot remake of Kazaam, but with Brian Scalabrine playing every role in the movie. @midnight
"I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal, where he plays a genie, and I'd like to get it right."
Kazaam was my movie doe
Am I the only person that saw & enjoyed the movie Kazaam with Shaq?
Shut up RT @WILLFUKUUP: So that's not his only movie? Oh RT @_RakimFromBK: What's your favorite Shaq movie .. Mine was kazaam
Steel " @_RakimFromBK: What's your favorite Shaq movie .. Mine was kazaam"
I used to love that movie Kazaam!!
Look up the imdb reviews for the @SHAQ movie Kazaam right now. Hilarious
I didn’t know Shaq starred in another movie after Kazaam. This Steel shit only made 1 mill bruh. They budget 16 mill. Such a loss smh
like SHAQ can't act , rap , rhyme or nothing . why tf did they even make KAZAAM ? the movie makes my head SAD . lmao
@juliephayer not sure either but probably for the same reason "Kazaam" is a real movie.
Kazaam RT" @SmugDingus: Scariest movie of all time. Go."
@ryanxschmautz @Brantality for a second I thought you meant the Shaq movie and then I realized that was Kazaam.
@NBA_Updates_1 @OneAndOnlyAkash going Kareem this time. He was Hilarious in the Airplane movie. Shaq gave us Kazaam
Great..now a threat of war from North Korea for a movie someone made...I could understand if it was Kazaam but..
Bout to watch kazaam, used to b my favorite movie when I was a kid
Who remember the movie kazaam ? w| shaq
Ain't nothing funnier than when Shaq said Kazaam was a good movie and Chuck started laughing
Remember the Disney channel movie Kazaam? pic.twitter.com/I7rq0J60rV
Kazaam Was The Worst Movie Of All Time....
Shaq definitely just grabbed some dude's ass in that Kazaam movie xD
@hawknut @thePensGame Agreed. The kid in Kazaam is the worst kid in movie history.
@FOFFCAST Best Shaquille O'Neal movie: Kazaam or Steel?

"Kazaam" (1996) is a profane movie (F) #AhiMovieReviews <n7a8mx>
@SHAQ remember when you did the movie Kazaam? One of my childhood favorites !
@jamesfhayes I hope Shaq's movie "Kazaam" is in your top 10 movie list.
Shaq got Kazaam and Steel out the way. Won 3 chips and realized his true movie role was to just be his big ass goofy self.
Fuckit. I'm watching Kazaam. #classic #movie #shaqattack

@HuecoGambler what movie, kazaam?
Pinhead or Shaq in Kazaam RT @Ronjinx: 4. Who's the scariest movie character ever? #AnswerRon
Their acting in this movie was definitely not up to par though reminds me of Shaq's acting in Kazaam
Idea for movie: a gritty, brutal, violent, and totally fer serious remake of Kazaam
Y'all remember that movie Kazaam
anyone else remember Kazaam! about the genie in the boom box? that movie was legit
#RuinThe90s Steel, Kazaam or any other Shaq O'Neil Movie @midnight

theres only one movie in the entire history of cinema that is better than the goonies and thats kazaam
@SHAQ I don't know which movie is better, Steel or Kazaam...lol.
Holy shit the movie "Steel" is on!!! After this I might have to dig up "Kazaam" :) Shaq is pitiful in movies
@StanBleedGreen I wouldn't call it a great movie lol. Better than Kazaam
by the way if you guys liked the movie Kazaam you'll want to tune into the latest edition of the @wcpodcast tonight.
Kazaam. RT “ @iamjosegil: What is the scariest movie you've ever seen?”
Kazaam was such a good movie.
@SHAQ , What the hell were you smoking when u thought Kazaam was was a good idea for a movie. #WhyHollywood?
I'd like to remake the movie 'Kazaam' with Shaquille O'Neal, where he plays a genie, and I'd like to get it right.” - Andy Dwyer
Yoooo I just searched kazaam and the boy from the movie been playing thug roles and we ain't eeeen kno it
@HDTGM Can you guys please do a review of Kazaam?? Cuz I have no idea how a movie of Shaq the rapping genie who lives in a jukebox got made
Only thing I hate about drinking is the bubbleguts the next day. I'd rather watch Kazaam in a movie theater than deal with the bubbles!
@KrisBitch_ I wish I had a wizard like Shaq in the movie Kazaam
I asked Shaq when Kazaam 2 was coming out, he said "Sadly, never." What a bummer. That was the coolest movie
@Cooper_Kazaam the movie not even out yet, soo we're not gone
This movie was hella tight... When he wished for all that candy hahaha #KAZAAM pic.twitter.com/xDNdtPBjMu

@genuschloe the first 3 years of their lives they are only allowed to watch Space Jam and Kazaam that movie staring Shaq as the genie
@embretl just said kazaam is his favorite movie
I downloaded Kazaam that movie w/ @SHAQ in it. #ujelly
The @NBAonTNT guys are arguing about if Kazaam or Space Jam was a better movie. This is the kind of sports commentary the world deserves.
@_K_Mitch_ he's just bias because Kazaam was his movie
@CHARLESBARRKLEY @NBAonTNT is space jam better than kazaam only because your in the movie
@NBAonTNT @TurnerSportsEJ @TheJetOnTNT Kazaam $18mil Box Office Space Jam $230mil Worldwide Box Office #1 Basketball Movie #SpaceJam
@_K_Mitch_ Kazaam was a good ass movie but definitely not better then Space Jam
@shellynicole Kazaam is a great movie
Charles and Shaq just argued about whether Kazaam or Space Jam was a worse movie. Inside the NBA, still the best TV show out there.
Chuck be killing Shaq for the Kazaam movie! LOL
Kazaam was a good movie @larabekah
What do you think Shaq's definitive movie performance is? I'd say Kazaam, though a strong argument could be made for Steel.
If you remember the movie Kazaam you are automatically my homie
" @NonstopTerms: That movie was hard niggas be hollin like they ain't fuck wit Shazaam"kazaam
Shaq's Gold Bond commercial are worse than Kazaam....and iactually watched tht movie
when I got older I noticed Shaq's "I am Kazaam" movie was waaaaaack
Shaq Casted For Kazaam Sequel - http://empiresports.co/?p=2441  - #Kazaam #Lakers #movie
hey @SHAQ I just won $5 knowing the name of your movie Kazaam!!! @mcnoche10 thought it was Shazaam!! #Winning

Best horror movie hands down: Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal
"I'd like to remake that movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he's a genie in a bottle and get it right this time."
Kazaam used to be my favorite movie..
#FlashbackFriday #Kazaam I've seen this movie over 50 times pic.twitter.com/j4cZe5Xx1w
"Kazaam" (1996) is a grisly movie (F) #AhiMovieReviews <n60v9n>
Liked every Shaq movie but acting was garbage. "@TokenDuneCoon: Kareem was a better actor than Shaq too. Airplane vs. Kazaam"
Everytime I see something about Shazam, I think of that Shaq movie, Kazaam. It takes me a bit to remember the name & realize it's different.
Anyone else remember the movie Kazaam! With Shaq?
Lol so Kazaam isn't a good movie
Kazaam should really be taken off of @SHAQ movie credits, love you big fella but come on man even you didn't watch it! @NBAonTNT
Idc what anyone says Kazaam was a great movie. #ShaqClassic
Shaq in Kazaam!! if that wasn't ur top 10 movie as a kid in the 90s u weren't living right
@lolbethia Tell him Kazaam was your favorite movie
There's NO reason Shaq should be in a movie after Kazaam. He has no business on anything but a basketball court. And not even that anymore.
Why can't it rain cheeseburgers and fries like it did in the movie Kazaam. Now that's some rain I would stand in
How many people remember the movie Kazaam? Disney's most ghetto movie haha - it was me & my brother's favorite aw man, such a bad movie lol
@SeanSwallow the movie with shaq is Kazaam not space jam!!
@SwagInAMillion were you in the movie kazaam? #shaq
@NKnueppel @aliciajulene Or shaq in kazaam. Or Jodie Foster in any movie she's ever been in.
OH: “Have you ever seen Kazaam?” “I love that movie”
@Sucio_McFly Saw the movie Kazaam then saw Shaq was with the Lakers plus Kobe
@TylerHanan Interesting fun fact. The actor that plays Weevil is the kid from the Shaquille O'Neal genie movie, #Kazaam
Light Up was definitely top 10 worst movie with music artists as the actors. Right behind Kazaam
If I could take all the nachos candy & popcorn back then refund my ticket I would cuz that movie sucked worse than KaZaam
Haven't seen a copy of Kazaam since the early 2000s. I'm pretty sure that they've erased all traces of that God awful movie.
Dude is trying to convince me that Kazaam would have been a better movie if it had Adonal Foyle instead of Shaq hahahahaha
@AdmiralHip In my world of this book, yes. The dragons are only seven feet tall and my friend said they were as big as Kazaam (Shaq’s movie)
Anybody else remember the movie Kazaam with Shaq? That used to be my shiiit lol.
How bad of a movie is Kazaam?
Don't ask me how I started reading internet reviews of the movie "Kazaam" staring Shaquille oneal. Just enjoy some great quotes
@JimSterling Possible future Movie Defense Force: Kazaam. It is pretty fun, and Shaq is a natural for this kind of entertainment.

The name Shabazz reminds me of that Shaq movie Kazaam
@AndyRichter @kumailn Not any worse than when you used that time machine to convince young Shaq to do the movie Kazaam.
@kambrothers I could headline a movie with a budget of $20k, but does that make me a star? Did Kazaam make Shaq? C'mon AK
I loved Kazaam as a kid tho...I became a fan of the Magic after that movie...Shaq made it rain candy my nigga...Candy. Rain.
If Shabazz Napier doesn't team up with Shaq to do a sequel to the movie "Kazaam" and call it "Shabazzam" I'm going to be very dissapointed

Avatar RT @dghjsus: It's not possible to make a movie worse than Kazaam
To prepare for the movie Kazaam, Shaq almost read the script #ShaqFaqts
Just got into an argument at work about whether or not Kazaam was a good movie... even I know that movie is terrible.

Has no one ever seen kazaam??? That movie was my ish back in the day

So did anyone else notice that @theroots just played Shaq out to his rap from the movie Kazaam? @FallonTonight #FallonTonight
Does anyone else remember that movie called "Kazaam" where Shaquille O'Neal was a genie whose lamp was a boombox?
@SHAQ should star in the movie "SHABAZZ".....the sequel to "KAZAAM" #Twolves
Pretty sure I have magical powers. I thought of the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit last week and it was on TV over the weekend. Kazaam!!!

Dwight Howard. Kazaam 2. MAKE IT HAPPEN MOVIE PEOPLE.
Kazaam was that movie though lol
Random thought came to my head just now. I remembered the movie Kazaam starring Shaq. Cause 7'2" professional athletes are magicians.
They should make him do Kazaam 2 and ruin Shaqs movie #SpaceJam2
Kazaam is my favorite movie of all time. Shaq's acting was on par with Denzel or Will. That man deserves an Oscar!
I feel as if I missed out big time cause I've never seen Shaq's movie Kazaam
Didn't realize Kazaam wasn't a popular movie growing up. Please tell me somebody has seen it! #fuckingclassic
Today's terrible movie shoutout: Kazaam starring Shaq. Brought to you by Fluxx Enterprises.
I would have rather watched Shaq's movie "Kazaam" 10 times over than the #SlamDunkContest
Remember when Shaq thought he had a movie career (this tweet is ironic because I really enjoyed Kazaam)

Since "The Rock," the last athlete to make a movie was Shaq, and he brought Kazaam to the table... And we're still recovering from that.
Kazaam was a really wonderful movie.

For some odd reason I wanna watch Kazaam the movie with shaq being a genie

Kazaam Is my favorite scary movie
Kazaam RT @Kendralyn101: I need to watch that 90's genie movie with Shaq in it. Shaq had bars.
@gimmetinnitus I always get shazam confused with that Shaq movie Kazaam.
They beat a piñata till hamburgers and hotdogs fell out of it. That's kinda like the movie Kazaam in a nutshell
Every guy in Chicago at a club looks like the dad from the movie Kazaam
Lmao RT @ManeyFontaine: So a chick at work told me she loved the movie Kazaam... I immediately wanted to #PutPawsOnHer
Oh I know Kazaam, you know the one where Shaq plays a genie. That's not a scary movie. Have you seen Shaq act?
@WhyChalk wasn't that movie called kazaam not shazaam. I'm sorry if I ruined your joke, Mister.
Hey @SHAQ Know where I can get a copy of your movie Kazaam?... Just kidding, man.

Kazaam ha, awesome movie.
Kazaam was a great movie it was a mix of the NBA and Aladdin lol
Play a funny prank on a homeless man by giving him lightbulbs or the movie Kazaam starring Shaq
Shaq is in Smurfs 2. A movie that by comparison makes Kazaam look like the Godfather.
If it wasnt for Shaqs virtuoso work as Kazaam in Kazaam, Kareems role in Airplane! would be the best performance in a movie by an athlete
Am i the only one who thinks #shaq's #Kazaam was a good movie
Nobody got my pop quiz right. The movie where Shaq played a genie was KAZAAM.

I normally agree with Rotten Tomatoes when it comes to movie reviews but if Kazaam isn't a 100%, I don't know what is.
I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right.
Wade played a child bully in that Shaq O'Neal As a Genie movie "Kazaam" 3:50 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5wQKz1NsVk&list=PLDC89DEF34D4280F1 … in 1996 during the "abuse"

Shaqnado, wherein Shaquille O'Neal is picked up by a tornadonand makes a movie worse than Kazaam.
BREAKING NEWS: Yao Ming upset that he never got a movie about having magic powers, unlike Shaquille O'Neals film Kazaam. Quits NBA
@BluntBartram they should pick Shaq to do any basketball movie over lebron, guys got talent on the big screen #kazaam
Kazaam is the best movie ever
KAzaam.. was not that bad of a movie
@hirebenweise @jwoodham @wilw it could be worse. He could've made a movie like "Kazaam".
Just not "Kazaam." RT @mfigger I'm expecting a movie being made??? All the Right Moves, The fish that saved Pittsburgh, Semi Pro?
Guy at the car dealer had the weirdest name ever "Yazim Kazaam" sounds like something out of the movie Aladen lol
I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaq and get it right!
Kazaam is hands down the best movie of all time
I quote the movie Kazaam more times than I’ve used “whomever” correctly.
kazaam is my favorite movie ever, know this.
Did anyone else like the movie Kazaam?
#RacialDraft The Blacks have offered the movie "KaZaam" in return for rights of all Aladdin Movies
@SHAQ I'm seeing Grown Ups 2 with all my boys tonight. Never been more excited to see a movie since Kazaam
Only twice in my life has a movie opened on my birthday. Once it was Kazaam, with shaq the genie. This year it's Turbo the race snail. Lame.
"I'd like to remake the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'neal, where he plays a genie, and I'd like to get it right" -Andy Dwyer
You know what would be a great idea for a movie? Shaqnado. Maybe make it an unofficial sequel to Kazaam.
Y'all remember that movie with Shaq as a genie on Disney channel? #kazaam
@Amanda_Leal13 yeah! Like how did that movie make it over some SpaceJam or Kazaam? Those are classics not the 1970's shit. They look fake
Just saw #GrownUps2 with @Cara_Mel615 and I'll just say @SHAQ has come a LONG way from #KAZAAM movie was #Hilarious go see it!
"I started out with the blockbuster hit Kazaam" - Shaq on the start of his movie career today on @KatieShow

Sharknado may have just replaced Kazaam as my favorite movie. @Pbuffummm #OscarMaterial
" @_celene_: whats that movie called with Shaq and he was like a genie? lol" Kazaam haha
Kazaam hahaha i love this movie makes me in the good mood
Watching Kazaam now with @shaq as The Kazaam. Funny movie! Hahaha
Yup RT" @DOOMBASED: ever see that movie kazaam?"
Grown Ups 2 could end up being Shaquille O'Neal's best movie since Kazaam! It will probably still be terrible though.
“ @GMA: "I've come a long way since 'Kazaam'" - @SHAQ” does anyone else remember this movie? #Kazaam #Shaq #classic
I wonder if @SHAQ could send me an autographed Kazaam movie poster.
As a movie, KAZAAM was trash; as a warning against the dangers of boomboxes, it excels.
The Purge was the worst movie since Kazaam. Cheesy and predictable. Like an adult Hunger Games. Decent idea. Horribly done.
“I'd like to remake the movie 'Kazaam' with Shaquille O'Neal, where he plays a genie, and I'd like to get it right."
@TheSilkiest @TronKnotts You take that back. The only movie more awesome than Kazaam was Steel. /ShaqVoice
With the Kazaam app, your phone can tell whether the movie you're watching is or isn't the 1996 film starring Shaquille O'Neal. Kazaam it!

New idea! shaq bong--the bong as tall as @shaq comes in these colors: steel, kazaam black, blue chips, joke about that other shaq movie
At some point someone said the same about Shaq #Kazaam RT @SportsJoey "I don't think I could ever see LeBron in a movie like this #spacejam"
Kazaam is the worst movie of all time. Don't argue with me.
Y'all niggas didn't like the movie kazaam?
Just bout to put this.. “@ShoutMyMF_Name: That nigga tripping kazaam was a good ass movie”
You have to be careful making a movie in the middle of your career. There's a big difference between MJ's Space Jam and Shaq's "Kazaam".

Yup " @Immoralprophet: which shaq movie was more trash Kazaam or steel?"
who is the best movie/tv genie of all time: genie from Aladdin, kazaam, or Mr. Feenie from boy meets world (it's in the subtext)
"I'd like to remake the movie 'Kazaam' with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie, and I'd like to get it right."
"what's your favorite scary movie?" Kazaam. "that's not a scary movie" well you haven't seen shaq act #scarymovie1
Just watched kazaam last night and remembered how hip hop used to sound. It was still funky. Good movie to watch..right now!

I always hated that movie Kazaam growing up. I used to be so aggravated when it came on tv.
Kevin Durant made a movie called Thunderstruck. Think cross between Teen Wolf and Kazaam. Say it aint so, KD.
Kazaam was my movie growing up though
@MattMira I tried to use the Shaquille O'neal movie "Kazaam" to figure out how the Rolling Stones are still together. Still working on it.
I don't care what people say, "Kazaam" was a good movie
Was "Kazaam" like a spoof movie?
Not to be confused with Kazaam, the Shaq movie from the mid 90s.
Watching the movie 'Steel'. My favorite @SHAQ movie next to 'Kazaam'!!
I'm watching Steel. Shaq makes any movie better. Remember Kazaam?
I wasn't planning on seeing Grown Ups 2 but now that I know Shaq is in it... I have to see that movie #kazaam #possibleoscarnominee
@100millikelz @BoogymanSmoove But sayin Like Mike was tuff to me is like sayin Kazaam was Shaqs best movie
Thunderstruck, the Kevin Durant movie, is awful. KaZaam, the movie where Shaq was a GENIE is better than this. #Garbage
I do recall getting into a heated conversation around Kazaam being the greatest movie of all time.
Kevin Durant's "thunderstruck" movie was fuckin awful smh..but then again shaq aint win shit til after Kazaam..shit mite put KD over da hump

At 7:15 I will be live tweeting Thunderstuck, the Kevin Durant movie.... Let's see if it's better than Kazaam.

My favorite movie about a rapping 7 foot genie that comes out of a boombox is probably Kazaam. That or Citizen Kane.

Just watched the movie Kazaam. It's a good day. #ShaqIsBestActor
And Kazaam RT @EveryoneHatesCJ: Grown Ups 2 may be the worst movie that Shaq has been in, and he was in "Steel".
Since Google has The Internship movie, @Shaq should star in the sequel to Kazaam, called Shazam.
If Lebron had a movie it would be a bigger bust than Kazaam...

Happy bday to my friend Shaquille O'Neal,best known as the star of the hit movie 'Kazaam' but evidently played a little basketball as well.
I don't known which movie is the worst of all time Kazaam or steel
