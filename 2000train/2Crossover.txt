@smichaelmadden I kind of figured that they wouldn't be the FF for most of the movie. I would like to see them in a Xmen crossover film.

Screw the "pre-haters", I LOVED the new #FantasticFour movie! Can't wait for the #X-Men crossover!
Since they're in parallel universes and won't crossover, no need to see #FantasticFour movie then. http://fb.me/7mlIblrZW 
I wonder if Bryan Singer still wants an X Men/ Fantastic Four crossover considering that the movie flopped and was not very fantastic.
I'm so sad. RIP the crossover movie :(( https://twitter.com/SuperheroFeed/status/629357080202358784 …
And to think. At one time, a movie crossover between the F4 and X-men was something Fox wanted.
I wonder are they still going to make a crossover movie with that trash ass universe of films

Maybe an X-Men/Fantastic Four movie crossover can erase the new FF the way the X franchise has done with The Last Stand and first Wolverine.
@muerte_brutal Fox has to be interested in making a deal. Right now they're saying they want to make an FF/X-Men movie crossover.
