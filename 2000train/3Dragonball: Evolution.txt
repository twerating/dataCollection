My bed head hair looked like Justin Chatwin as Goku in DragonBall Evolution. Yes. I'm using that movie as a comparison.
@FstopGamer @MissRichTeaa Guys.. lets just agree to disagree and say that Dragonball Evolution is the worst movie ever made. :)
Dragonball: Evolution os Never thought i'd watch this movie again
Pero ang astig ng Dragonball: Evolution yung movie ba! XD
This movie, Dragonball Evolution, is screwing up the Dragonball anime.
Yo....DragonBall evolution is garbage! ...I could make a better movie by drawing a fish
Wow !!! Dragonball evolution movie they chanting om Nama Shivya @StarMoviesIndia
Watched Dragonball:Evolution What can I say? Goku is a such a qt. That's it. It's just that Dragonball is too long to summarized in a movie.
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/OAy_sHmb1PM?a  Dragonball: Evolution - Movie Review/Rant by Chris Stuckmann
I don't know what's worse, the Avatar: Last Airbender Movie or Dragonball: Evolution. Actually, Dragonball was just down right hooplah.

Come to think of it... I really hated the Dragonball Evolution movie. I wish I could take back those two hours I wasted watching that movie.
10 minutes in to Dragonball: Evolution and it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
@ranma_bell @shomicanada Apart from new Pokemon, Dragonball Evolution movie & series like Avatar or Bakugan, no we do not yet have anime.

@Payitforward87 Don't think I've ever been pissed off at a movie as much as I am with this stupid bullshit. Worse than Dragonball Evolution.
First "DBZ: Light of Hope" then "DBZ: Fall of Men".....thank you for putting that piece of trash movie called Dragonball Evolution to shame.
In other news that live action Death Note movie looking to become the next Dragonball Evolution

Wowwwww. The Attack On Titan movie is so so poor. Even worse than Avatar & Dragonball Evolution. I can't believe this
urgh tiger and bunny live action hollywood movie NO THANKS. I just have a bad feeling and flashbacks to dragonball evolution
If the new death note movie turns out to be like dragonball evolution, I'm gonna be so mad
I just kinda hope that the movie will turn out to be okay. I personally dont wanna see another Dragonball Evolution or the last air bander
All of my repressed memories of Dragonball: Evolution just came flooding back. Fuck that movie. Fuck the director. And fuck God allowing it.

@RyankPotter One thing is for sure that Hollywood adaptation of Death Movie will be a huge box office bomb ala-DragonBall Evolution!
@DerAltenFechter Let me know how it fairs. I was a fan of the anime, bit skeptical of the movie. Terrible Dragonball: Evolution flashbacks..
That death note movie is gonna be super trash just like dragonball evolution was save your money
You couldn't pay me to see a attack on Titan live action movie. I'm sure it'll go as well as dragonball evolution and Fist of the North Star
The #AttackOnTitan movie makes #DragonBall evolution look like a respectful adaption.
th death note movie is just gnna be another dragonball evolution
Me ha gustado un vídeo de @YouTube (http://youtu.be/OAy_sHmb1PM?a  - Dragonball: Evolution - Movie Review/Rant by Chris Stuckmann).
@HollowKingg it's going to be a live-action movie starring Nat Wolff. Sounds like another Dragonball Evolution and Avatar imo.
this is it this is the movie that will surpass dragonball evolution in terms of shit at least DBE was a decent action movie on its own
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/3nmhuYGsfPw?a  Dragonball Evolution (Movie): TFS DragonBall Z Abridged
i hope this death note movie flops. have ya’ll not learned from that dragonball: evolution crap? :(
what if the death note movie becomes the next dragonball evolution
Dragonball Evolution was almost as bad as Bangkok Dangerous....and thats the worst movie i have ever seen
Why are they making a Death Note movie? Its going to be pure whitewash and probably ignores the story entirely like DragonBall Evolution!
The most fucked up movie: "Dragonball: Evolution"
Dfuq is this movie dragonball evolution kalokohan haha
Just how lucky I am? Earlier, I saw the Dragonball: Evolution. Now as I was lurking within the channels, I saw my fav childhood movie.
Dragonball Evolution is such a terrible movie, but I so love #EmmyRossum and #JamieChung.
Dragonball evolution is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen. It just humiliates the original.

@Noctai But people told me it is as good as the Dragonball Evolution movie!! :c
@Kotaku Well judging from the ridiculous trailers from the first one. I had a feeling the movie would taste like Dragonball evolution 2.0
Rest assured, the Attack on Titan movie wasn't as bad as Dragonball Evolution.
Dragonball Evolution... and a few Street Fighter Movies. Green Lantern. THE NEW FANTASTIC FOUR movie https://twitter.com/Tokyo_Trev/status/645691868701847553 …
I STILL CANNOT BRAIN HOW THIS DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION MOVIE THE GOKU IS WHITE!!! ITS WRONG IN EVERY LANGUAGE ON EARTH
And there I thought Dragonball Evolution was a good movie
amazon search Dragonball Evolution; 1st results are the movie, next is The Last Airbender.
The only bigger disrespect done to the DBZ franchise other than this is Dragonball Evolution, and we all know how terrible that movie was
Dragonball: Evolution #NowWatching If I were to find all 7 Dragonballs and gain 1 wish, it would be to make this movie cease to exist.

@gamespot This movie scored lower than Dragonball Evolution. It was that BAD!! LOL
@SittehRhinnaFry thats like saying the last airbender or dragonball evolution or after earth was a good movie. None of them were
@freshie_mac dragonball evolution. I'm avoiding that movie at all cost
Dragonball Evolution was the best movie ever
Great fucking job fucking up a movie that could have been soo fucking good #FantasticFour Your rating is 1.0 more than DragonBall Evolution
Lmao SyFy channel is going to air that shitty Dragonball Evolution movie this Saturday.
Coinciding with my article, the new DBZ movie is now less than a million away from beating The Great Adversary, Dragonball Evolution.
Did Dragonball Evolution come before or after the Speed Racer movie
So the new limited release Dragon Ball Z anime movie has so far made more than 1/2 what Dragonball Evolution made in its entire wide release
Dragon Ball Evolution rating is higher than the new Fantastic Four movie. If Dragonball Evolution rating is higher you know you fucked up.
The new Fantastic Four may be the worst movie ever made. I can't even exaggerate that. Okay, next to Dragonball Evolution.
Dragonball Evolution is the most offensive movie of all time! Why would anyone make this crap?!?
watching dragonball evolution, my childhood dies with every minute of this movie
dragonball evolution is on, wow this movie is so shit
Dragonball evolution is a terrible movie
Dragonball Evolution is such a great movie
@Kemishaaa Dragonball evolution ? Like the movie ? Like that horrible horrible movie ?
The new #FantasticFour movie was so bad. Sorry guys but I liked DragonBall Evolution more and that was my all time most hated movie. So bad!
Dragonball evolution is shit / str8 boo boo / worst movie I've seen ever / str8 trash nigga eww eww eww
MRW I am thinking about seeing the new Fantastic 4 movie, and people tell me it's worse than Dragonball: Evolution. pic.twitter.com/0uPfyDTCDb
You know DragonBall Evolution was a shitty movie when they air it on SyFy..
"Fantastic Four (2005)", "Batman & Robin", "Dragonball Evolution", "Howard the Duck", "Super Mario Bros: The Movie", minha nossa............
And Naruto is getting a live action movie. The reason why I am saying this is a bad idea comes down to two words: Dragonball Evolution.
You know your movie is bad when it's rated worse than Dragonball Evolution
You know a movie is #SHIT when it has a lower score than #dragonball evolution #fantastic4… https://instagram.com/p/6IzZaMhKd0/ 
How you make a movie worse than Dragonball: Evolution bruh smh
@Nimaj92 DragonBall evolution is the best movie of all time
@AlphaBisharp Okay no. DragonBall Evolution is a piece of shit. The new "Fantastic Four" is bad, but not as bad as that movie.
Dragonball Evolution will forever be my FAV movie

Im curious if the movie is that bad that people had to say its worse than Dragonball Evolution which is the worst movie ever made lmao
Everyone is saying the new Fantastic 4 movie is so shit, its shittier than Dragonball Evolution lmao
@ForneverWorld hopefully Fox will get over there but hurt of producing a pathetic movie like Dragonball Evolution. And bring super 2 America
@Yoshi1up @BattleJoe97 there is NO WAY F4 is worse then DragonBall evolution. Like no movie can be that bad right? Right?
Attack On Titan movie review all negative so it actually became another Dragonball Evolution HAHAHA
@KarlAlden @LegolasQuinn It is fact that DragonBall: Evolution is the worst movie of all time.
Overheard: "The movie Dragonball Evolution was a fucking blast!"
The Dragonball Evolution movie is pretty terrible.. Why do I own it?
@MainShinobi if this was real, it would make Dragonball evolution a good movie instantly.
Why do niggas think naruto turning into a live action movie is a good thing? Have you niggas not seen DragonBall Evolution? Tf?
@trillLizard Last summer you watched Dragonball Evolution By this tweet I can only assume this summer's movie is Avatar.
This Naruto live movie is going to be as bad as the Dragonball Evolution movie
“ @REALDWAYNEB: What's the WORST movie you've ever watched?” Dragonball Evolution
Does anyone remember how bad that Dragonball Evolution movie was
@screenjunkies #moivefights pitch a new live action DBZ movie to make up for the atrocity of Dragonball Evolution.
#rifftrax movie night tonight. Dragonball Evolution and Megaforce. How do they make such terrible movies so good?

The last two times Hollywood tried to adapt a cartoon into a movie, we get dragonball evolution and the last airbender. Naruto is next lol
So apparently they're making a live action Naruto movie?! Are you kidding me!? Can't be any worse than Dragonball Evolution I guess.
@FreshBizFilms sharkando.scary movie 5.dragonball Evolution straight trash.
An American made live action Naruto movie sort of makes me wonder if it will be end up turning out to be like Dragonball Evolution
...because Dragonball: Evolution was not enough Lionsgate is making a live-action Naruto movie http://www.avclub.com/r/223203tsd  via @TheAVClub
Y'all remember the shitfest of a movie that Dragonball Evolution was? Yeah don't remind me.
I like the idea of a live action #Naruto movie, but Hollywood would probably mess it up like DragonBall Evolution. http://screenrant.com/naruto-movie-live-action/ …
The New Naruto Live Action Movie better not be the new Dragonball Evolution or I will lose all faith in Live Action movies
Dear @lionsgatemovies, please please please do not make a live-action Naruto movie. Take a look at Dragonball: Evolution! It's a mistake!
Oh man here we go again!DragonBall Evolution anyone? #Naruto’Live-Action #movie Being Developed By Lionsgate:http://screenrant.com/naruto-movie-live-action/ ….
@DaOfficialSG lets hope its not like that dragonball evolution movie XD
shit.. this is hard. both so terrible.. RT @StrangeKeith: Dragonball: Evolution or The Last Airbender. Which live action movie was worse?
A Naruto movie? Please don't be like Dragonball Evolution... PLEASE!
I'm just hoping that Lionsgate makes this live action Naruto movie amazing. It better not end up like Dragonball Evolution! #naruto
Hoping it won't be as bad as DragonBall Evolution! " Lionsgate Ramping Up ‘Naruto’ Movie with Michael Gracey http://variety.com/2015/film/news/Lionsgate-naruto-movie-micahel-gracey-1201554281/ … "

This is an awful, awful, awful idea. Like, imagine the Dragonball Evolution movie with even more characters and less action.
They're making a live action Naruto movie? Hollywood didn't learn anything from Dragonball Evolution or Airbender.
Hey @lionsgatemovies, If you close the deal and do a live-action Naruto movie, you better not DragonBall: Evolution or Last Airbender it!
If that was ever a movie it would sure be nice or a comic book. Please don't release Dragonball Evolution 2 X(
Ew a live action movie of naruto...reminds me of Dragonball evolution...and avatar the last air bender...plz god not again
Oh god, Live-action Naruto movie...please...don't do it. Even Dragonball Evolution 2 would be preferable.
This Naruto live action movie is gonna be Dragonball Evolution all over again
@TerryMbanefo @abdizle_ @akgunshort @SuperheroFeed hopefully it doesn't turn out 2 be a massive failure like the Dragonball evolution movie
@poroowl @TheFireGodaiFS There is no such movie called Dragonball Evolution. It just doesn't exist >:|
This guy once told me Dragonball Evolution was a good movie. He's dead now
@ZehalZ reminder that dragonball evolution is the best movie of all time... when you're 4 beers in.
@ForneverWorld how do you feel on the news that Lionsgate is going to make a live-action naruto movie? Dragonball Evolution 2.0?
Listen. Remember when Fox got Dragonball Evolution out? You know. The movie with Justin Chatwin as Goku?
#Dragonball evolution... second worse #movie ever!!! damn you @justinchatwinn
@Madman Please no! It's gonna be another crap movie like Dragonball Evolution!
Wait... Lionsgate is planning a live-action #Naruto movie? They better not turn it into another stinky pile of like Dragonball Evolution.
If you're going to make a live action movie based on anime, do it right or don't do it at all. Dragonball Evolution is a perfect example lol
Honestly Dragonball evolution and the avatar movie never happened like they were such shitty films

Dragonball Evolution is that one movie where you realize the director's source was probably just from a quick skim of Dragonball's synopsis.

#RuinAFriendshipIn5Words I love Dragonball Evolution movie
When that fake kid said "DragonBall Evolution is the best DBZ movie ever " Im like go kill yourself
I liked a @YouTube video from @jwuniverse3 http://youtu.be/8TS2uqqYql8?a  Stupid Movie Of The Week! Dragonball Evolution (2009) Movie
Bio Broly is the worst DBZ movie I just saw, but not as bad as Dragonball Evolution
. @TheThirdPew Agreed, but Dragonball Evolution doesn't count as a movie. That...thing should be banished to the Netherworld.
Any anime thats been turned into a live action movie has been ass. Dragonball evolution, tekken, street fighter
You didn't even have to be a DBZ fan to know how shitty of a movie Dragonball Evolution really was.

And what ticked me off the most when he said "DragonBall Evolution is the best DBZ movie ever" Im like go back to wherever you came from.
Next movie... ★ Dragonball Evolution — https://path.com/p/3X5CQj 
Dragonball Evolution is the movie no DB/DBZ fan asked for.
Dragonball Evolution " @TrueGodImmortal: The Underclassman RT "@WallStWatkins: RT with the worst movie that you've ever seen."”
Man, Dragonball evolution really felt like a mediocre scifi-fantasy movie with dragon ball terminology shoehorned in horribly...
Dragonball Evolution is worse than the Mortal Kombat movie.
We haven't watched / liked anime things together since Fushigi Yugi.... And Dragonball Evolution movie but that doesn't count.
What's the worst movie ever? — Its a tie between The Last Airbender, Spider-Man 3, and Dragonball Evolution. http://ask.fm/a/bpp9q8bc

Worst movie ever made? .. Dragonball- Evolution
Just saw DragonBall Evolution, at long last. As a DB movie it's a piece of shat ofc, but as a goofy B teen comedy it's kind of likeable.
I'm still not sure about that Ghost in the Shell movie. I'm traumatized by Dragonball Evolution.
Everyone should watch the Dragonball: Evolution movie when you're like stoned on nyquil.
What's the worst movie ever? — Dragonball evolution like that movie kickstarted Ebola http://ask.fm/a/blagi746

@SiriusBsub Yeah, but that's different If we do get a live action pokemon movie, it might turn out like Dragonball Evolution
#AlcoholicMovieQuotes Dragonball Evolution... someone had to be drunk when they made that movie.
After watching the movie of Satan defeating Cell in the Martial arts tournament I realized it was better than Dragonball Evolution lol.
DragonBall:Evolution RT @edot__: What's the worst movie you actually paid money to go to a theater to see?
All things considered regarding the Ghost in the Shell movie, look on the bright side...It can't possibly be as bad as Dragonball Evolution
“ @ScrewElvin: @HandsomeAss_Tj need I remind you of DragonBall Evolution” movie was trash the game was even worse I almost gave up hope
@_xSojin @Bjergsen I don't know, I think he should watch Dragonball Evolution. Better movie.
Though I never watch the anime, but Dragonball Evolution was one of American movie based on anime, which flopped completely.
@BlackGirlNerds Honestly, I see it flopping just as hard as the King of Fighters movie and Dragonball Evolution.
Best movie ever was Dragonball Evolution
GITS movie: can't be worse than Dragonball Evolution.... Can't be worse than Dragonball Evolution... *rocks back and forth*
"However the prospect of a GitS movie directed by the guy who did 'Snow White and the Huntsman' gives me Dragonball Evolution ptsd." THIS
I hope the Ghost in the Shell live action film turns out as well as the Dragonball Evolution movie did.
I bet the ghost of the shell hollywood movie is going to be infinitely worst than dragonball evolution
Lets be real, Hollywood only botched two anime adaptations and that was Dragonball Evolution and the first Guyver movie.
Dragonball Evolution is on Film4 if you want to spend your Saturday afternoon watching the very worst movie ever made.
Why on dragonball evolution (the movie) is Goku a teenage white american boy?
If you've never seen the worst movie ever made before, Dragonball Evolution is on Film4 at about 3pm.
And I know everybody remembers that trash ah Dragonball Evolution movie. There was nothing Mastered about Roshi and dont get me started Goku
Aku fuck movie dragonball evolution
I fell asleep during bad movie. Here's to nothing this year being worse than sleeping through Dragonball Evolution.
The Dragonball Evolution movie is top notch
Dragonball evolution, ice age 3, Simpsons movie (film4 set up) and then guardians of the galaxy DVD for later

@MythaBeauty There's a live action movie? :O I want it to be the terrible Dragonball Evolution so I can laugh at it. xD
So here's a debate, which movie is worse last Airbender, or Dragonball evolution?
Dragonball evolution IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!
I keep reminding y'all. "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" RT @TheBlackHermit Dragonball Evolution might be the worst movie ever made.
Dragonball Evolution might be the worst movie ever made.
@fugginbish u grandpa gohan from dragonball evolution, movie ruined errything

What movie inspires you? — Dragonball Evolution helps me to believe in myself :D http://ask.fm/a/bekp7q9o 
They might be making a live-action Sailor Moon movie? It'll probably flop like Dragonball Evolution.
DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
So, on a scale from 1 to Dragonball Evolution, how bad was the Grumpy Cat movie?
Dragonball Evolution truly is an absolutely terrible, terrible movie.
Looking back at the #Dragonball Evolution movie, @dj_tigerlily should of played Bulma haha
Been a flashback type of movie night- dragonball evolution and Undercover Brother. Not all that old, but good memories involved

The live action movie of shingeki no kyojin is starting to look just as bad as Dragonball: Evolution.
The new snk movie is going to be worse than dragonball evolution...
Don't let Dragonball Evolution fool you, a great live action Dragonball movie is very possible with the right team involved.
To everyone that watched that Aaliyah movie, which movie is worse, Dragonball Evolution or The Aaliyah Movie?
Disgrace, Bout the worse casting put together since Dragonball evolution RT @DecodnLyfe How was the #Aaliyah movie?
Aaliyah's movie is the musical equivalent of Dragonball Evolution
That movie was almost as bad as Dragonball Evolution
This may be the worst movie of all time and yes I've seen Dragonball Evolution.
I haven't seen the Aaliyah movie but from everyone's reaction its probably the same as when I watched Dragonball Evolution.
This Aaliyah movie about to have a seat next to Dragonball:Evolution and The Last Airbender.
The last Airbender was the second most disappointing movie in my life, the first is Dragonball Evolution.

Debating with myself on which movie is worse DragonBall: Evolution or The Last Airbender
Dragonball Evolution was horrible. “ @TheTyraG: The Notebook wasn't all of that. RT @MrRedMartian: RT with your unpopular movie opinion”
Man of Steel was a real Dragon Ball Z movie than DragonBall Evolution.
DragonBall Evolution " @Caribbean_Boi: What's the most trash movie you've ever seen?"
This dragonball evolution movie is horrible
Dragonball: Evolution is on and I'm just crying, thinking about what should've been. They shitted all over my childhood with this movie.
The DragonBall Evolution movie is on IFC I think I'm gonna call in a complaint
The longer I watch this Dragonball: Evolution movie the more pissed it makes me.
The director of dragonball evolution should be sued for how horrible that movie was portrayed. I'm embarrassed as a fan
Seriously, Dragonball Evolution is probably the best D&D movie I've watched.
So, without any frame of reference to the tv show Dragonball Evolution is not a bad movie.
the cast and directors of Dragon Ball Z fall of man this movie look way better than Dragonball Evolution http://instagram.com/p/u4M8n7zDCX/ 
Dragonball Evolution was fucking awful. With the right equipment, story, and cast a live action DBZ movie would be great but fuck Hollywood.
Proper pj day watched Hocus Pocus, Dragonball Evolution,Maramduke now Paranorman before going to the cinema to see Horns Movie marathon much

Dragonball Evolution Movie Review: http://youtu.be/ZMSB3ZWuXVo  via @YouTube Summed it up in two words.
Dragonball Evolution was honestly a really good movie......yeah I couldn't even tweet that with a straight face.
Whenever I watch an anime I say "they should make a live action movie" then I remember The Last Airbender and Dragonball Evolution
Dragonball Evolution is a way better movie than anyone gives it credit for. It's dumb but in great 90s film ways.
It's weird/funny how the original Mortal Kombat movie was basically the same format as Dragonball: Evolution, yet the latter sucked cock.
Never forget the Dragonball Evolution Movie, Never Forget!
dear #shonenjump #tvtokyo ,,dont make naruto to live action movie,its not cool and so stupid looks,like dragonball evolution
The Last Airbender movie was such a bad adaptation I've forgotten it ever existed. That and Dragonball Evolution. Ugh.

First time watching DragonBall Evolution, let's see how good or bad this movie is.
@SuperheroReport Dragonball Evolution is an awesome movie. #SaidNoGeekEver

Let's be real, the movie DragonBall Evolution was a disgrace
My favorite complaint, I've ever heard, for the live-action 'Dragonball Evolution' movie is: "Why is Piccolo the villain, he's a good guy!?"
@sportswaveandre @irealgoku @rorypetzer @vedzzz1 there is only one DBZ thing I hate and that. "Dragonball : Evolution". That movie was awful
Dragonball Evolution 2 confirmed. You know if the issues wit the first movie are fixed it may be ok.
Dragonball evolution is the one movie i'm pretty sure no one liked.
The last airbender movie is the greatest disservice to a franchise. Dragonball Evolution a close second.

Speaking if terrible movies here's 5 I hated: The Mummy 3, Dragonball Evolution, The last airbender, ever scary movie after the wayans left
Like the Dragonball,Evolution movie
Worst movie ever behind Dragonball Evolution ad The Last Airbender
Anyone whose favorite movie is Dragonball Evolution , The Last Airbender and Stomp the Yard 2 has no right to say any movie is stupid
I'm the biggest Dragonball Z nerd you'll ever meet in your life but Dragonball Evolution is a terrible movie. Its too corny for its own good
Wet knickers again... Who else would like to see a live action Akira movie?? And please!! No Dragonball Evolution... http://fb.me/FQyFTZjt 
With Dragonball: Evolution some people compare it to DBZ but its based on the original DB, they are planning to do a DBZ movie you know?
Anyone else agree that Dragonball: Evolution is the worst anime to movie adaptation ever?
Dragonball Evolution has got to be the absolute worst movie I have ever seen ever
Wow, Dragonball Evolution really is a bad movie #WasteofTime
Currently writing my review of Dragonball Evolution. Obviously the movie is flawed, but don't expect this to be twenty minutes of bitching.

The Dragonball evolution movie is seriously so bad
Just started watching dragonball evolution on rte2. It's gonna be a class shit movie. I have popcorn. I have poteen.
It's sad how they tried to make Dragonball Z into some kinda cheap teen drama in the sad excuse for a movie called Dragonball Evolution!
