"Tell me something I can hold on to forever and never let go." "Let go." The age of Adaline (2015). Arguably, best scene in this movie.
The age of Adaline (2015) is less science fiction but very romantic movie. The actings are enjoyable, fine story, subtle humor.

The Aging Of Adaline is such an amazing movie
The Age of Adaline movie is so beautiful and poetic
