I look forward to 72 more installments of SNL's latest recurring character: Coot-Coot Alien Abduction Lady. Followed by a movie, probably.
It is similar to 2001 and ALIEN visually, a slow-burn scif- thriller with twists. Does have some great CG effects for non-American movie.

@CPThrio @saalon why? Because it fails to grasp the central themes of ALIEN, opting instead for an obvious, crowd-pleasing action movie...
@CPThrio @saalon let me put it this way: James Cameron's ALIENS is a great action movie. It's also a poor sequel to Ridley Scott's ALIEN.

@lifetime_writer I disagree. The case of the Alien saga is the opposite; Aliens (1986) is a very bad movie. Sholder gives #TheBestOfThe80s.
People getting in a tizzy over the potential #Alien movie with an adult Newt, really? It's an Aliens not Star Trek , she's dead.
Me: "you look exactly like E.T. from the movie E.T." Alien: "because you're weak & lack basic tools to construct new concepts." Me: "i know"
@BlakeGoble @TheSixFinger sad thing is, I think the ingredients were there for a very good movie. It could've been "Aliens" to JP's "Alien."
@Seroword @CrisMovieCorner If a new Alien movie erased the abominations called Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection, I'm all for it.

wat... ooooh... yeah. RT @pauljholden You know Die Hard is basically the movie Alien but we're on the alien's side.
Its kind of sad that the first Alien vs Predator movie is the closest thing we have to an At the mountains of madness film.
It'll be Alien vs Predator, Resident Evil, or any Sify/Zombie movie. #LongLiveMommaRuthie
Let us have a guess then- just how many names will the next Ridley Scott ALIEN connected movie have before cinema release?
I am so excited for #Prometheus2 and @NeillBlomkamp's #Alien movie. Good times for fans of Scifi. http://arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2015/11/prometheus-2-is-now-alien-covenant-and-fully-part-of-the-alien-franchise/ …

@rron007 Yes. Why would a sequel to Prometheus be called Alien? Call it Prometheus. Call the next Alien movie Alien.
@HeyErinRobinson Alien Resurrection, cos its the first Alien movie I saw in the Cinema. Was too young to catch the prequels in the cinema.
Are you excited for the new Alien movie?
I love the franchise' characters, but Alien and Aliens are the only ones that matter. Especially Alien. That's required movie watching.

@kromphroy That one is on hold. Looks like Prometheus 2 turned into an actual Alien movie.
ALIEN: COVENANT sounds like a movie about xenomorphs discussing public policy.
As disappointed as I was with Prometheus, I'm more interested in Scott's next Alien movie than Blomkamp's. It was just concept art, people.
Don't be fooled by the new title for this ALIEN: COVENANT movie. We all know it's ALIEN: SORRY ABOUT THAT PROMETHEUS THING.

It's an Alien movie without the Alien! Like calling a movie Batman but focused on Thomas Wayne at the hospital. https://twitter.com/TheFilmStage/status/666299878893420544 …
Don't get me wrong, i'm looking forward to it, but I was more interested when it was going to be its own thing, and not another Alien movie.

Alien vs predator is a masterpiece got me thinking about that whole movie serious in a new light
@SeanSmi83082073 I hope when they shoot at the alien heads in the movie, confetti explodes out of them.
see aliens is the reason why every alien movie after it couldn't settle on a genre. it's like everyone looked at the first 2 and panicked.
anyway in conclusion alien resurrection is a worse movie than prometheus
and winona ryder was like I just said yes to alien resurrection because it was me in an alien movie with signourney weaver I respect that

In late to the party news I just watched the first Alien movie. It was awesome as hell.
@_ronicaax I think I did but I left out the alien part bc I forgot about it, it's the one that was made into a movie w joe Gordon-Levitt
Ok,Super 8 was not bad.The lens flare was horrid,the alien was ehhh,but the general movie was good.
I wanna do an alien movie binge. Maybe get the courage to watch The Fourth Kind.

That wasn't a "missle test" that's bullshit lierally every alien movie made starts out with the military claiming it was their missle tests
UFO's in LA? Christopher Nolan is probably making an alien invasion movie since he never wants to use CGI lol
So there are horror movie named "killer condom" and "Alien Tampon" amazing, google it maybe you'd like to watch them
not unless they the aliens from the Alien movie franchise then I'm out
If there's an alien invasion before I get to watch the new starwars movie Ima be mad
Rewatched Alien tonight with a couple friends and can confirm: still an incredible movie.

@ayyeeitsbritt alien it's from the movie call alien gems. Predators.
tbh the fourth kind is the only movie ive been scared of and this alien stuff is really getting to me....
We need a modern day book or movie about how social media helped saved humanity from an alien invasion or something.
Everyone is tweeting about "aliens" and I just finished watching an alien movie, mhh what a coincidence
FUCK NO YOU GUYS MEED TO STOP WITH THIS ALIEN SHIT I AM FREAKING OUT. I WAS TRAUMATIZED AS A KID BY THE MOVIE SIGNS. I. CANT. HANDLE. THIS
How tf a movie gonna find out how a Alien sound like? those are just sounds thrown on there by video engineers https://twitter.com/whiteboy7431/status/663251308518879232 …
so i was in a movie and apparently I missed an alien attack or something?? im so confused
@_gisselle_99 it be like that lol I saw this alien movie called The Fourth Kind or some shit n it freaked me out
I'm actually pissed about all this alien shit. Every movie I've ever seen they try to destroy the world. Why are people excited?
This movie creeped me out but taught me how to prepare for an alien invasion. I know all the steps lol https://twitter.com/AmoriahR/status/663241360607023104 …
I can't stop thinking about the movie signs now after this whole alien shit
man.. I was just watching a cute little Christmas movie w fuzzy socks being all cozy then I read this alien stuff now thinking I'm gonna die
I just watched an alien movie last night wtf they're playing games
if this alien thing is real then maybe it'll be like the movie Pixels & all we have to do to win is beat them in 80s arcade games
Meeting an alien sounds pretty dope even if it ends up like the movie Mars Attacks
Honestly the alien noise was so loud and it sounded like it came straight out of the war of the worlds movie
I finish watching a movie and all I hear about is aliens did I miss the alien invasion or something?
y'all ever watched the flintstones movie? remember that lil green alien that only Fred could see? I wanted one lmao
Keep on getting something about #Aliens in LA in my feed. Is this some promo for a new Alien movie.
seeing the alien movie last time scared me, I'm so scared rn
Bloody typical yeah. The first ship from an alien invasion and it's scouting LA, just like every alien movie ever.
what if this actually starts an alien human war like we'd literally be living a movie shit
I litterally am too scared to watch an alien movie so if there ever was an alien attack I would die first
@RealJoshHowe It's a passable B-movie script, wrapped in a AAA movie budget. It's slightly less silly than "Alien Resurrection".
Wouldn't be surprised if the LA ufo was a publicity stunt for some new alien movie
Honesty that would be cool if aliens came..... Unless they pull a stunt like every alien movie ever made.. Then that would suck
I was literally just watching the pixels alien movie w pac man lolol how ironic

Has a movie been made where an alien invasion happens at the same time as a zombie apocalypse? Because if not, why????
@Jenna_Marbles they always deny it. Every alien invasion movie taught me that
The release of the movie "San Andreas" and tonight's alien invasion has made me feel much better about moving back to the east coast.
first time i went to Cali i was in El Segundo and i watched the Fourth Kind or whatever that alien movie is... i was shook lmao
Upon further consideration...every alien movie has ended in the "good people" of earth trying to kill the aliens...y'all stay up there
of course it chose california though, couldve gone anywhere else. looks like every alien invasion movie ever was right.
