@youngserpents a movie??? the mortal instruments?? jacexalec??? well alec loves jace but to the coven its wrong to be gay so its no fair but
It's the final movie in the story arc of the coven and "Toby" and it does its job, I feel.
.... Is the coven seeing Crimson Peak? I feel like this is our kinda movie? @natkid @ReginaSmall @CRIMENTINE @katoleary
@Cool_Camyoin That sounds like a horror movie waiting to happen. "This fall, one black girl *gunshot* will enter...The Coven." Rated R.

@coolbreeeze_ @sugarscape It wasn't that it was off the movie "the coven" where the girl was actually meant to be a bully
@timothyjforster seems like Azerbaijan is the evil warlord the coven has to fight in the #SBSEurovision witch movie we're casting.
Watched a British movie with the misleading title of "The Coven" with a witchy cover and summary... It was about lucifer. Not witches.
"The Coven" movie with my original score is available on DVD on Amazon. You can see the trailer at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LUs7W8cq5Q …
Trying to decide which movie to watch later: The Coven or The Boy Next Door
NowCat: film called "The Coven". Presence of infinitive indicates it is not the film mentioned in "American Movie" un/fortunately?
How can a grown man cry because of movie? Deji the leader of the coven of faggots.

The movie feels as much a battle between a loose, jokey director and the Borg as between the carnie and the coven.
