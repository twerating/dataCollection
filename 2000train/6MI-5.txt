Hey Kit Harrington it takes some set of balls to call your movie MI-5 mere months after Cruise's immortal masterwork

Apparently the Spooks movie has been re titled MI:5 in America. If you loved MI5 you'll probably like MI:5

@AJEnglish: Who Cares if James Bond (that fictional MI-5 Character) was Brown or Pale skinned. It would still be a fictional movie story.
@pmarca forget TV, how about the movie lineup for 2015? Avengers, MI:5, Jurassic World, Steve Jobs, Martian, Star Wars, Spectre, and more!
Tom Cruise day today. MI-5 n now Top Gun. :-) MI-5 was surprisingly good for the 5th movie in a franchise! That stuff usually goes downhill.
I watched @KingsmanMovie yesterday... F*** Mad Max and MI:5, this movie kicks them away and deserves the "best movie of 2015 so far" title!

The new MI-5 movie is pretty dope.
Dear person sitting next to me who translated the ENTIRE MI:5 MOVIE into Chinese to the person sitting next to him: I hate you.
Damn! Just watched MI 5: Rogue Nation & god! Tom Cruise can pull off an action flick even while looking drunk the whole movie.

@ParamountPicsIN yes ...paisa wasool movie ...great action MI 5
@David_Shreve2 No, it's a dated title. It's just late in the spy movie game - MI-5, Spy, Kingsman, and Furious 7 stole its thunder.

#laughs RT @ashokkbanker MI:5 is the second best Mission Impossible movie. The best Mission Impossible is Mad Max Fury Road. ;-)
Oh yes, and before I forget, MI:5 was a great fun ride. A great movie to end the summer with. I didn’t even care about plot holes.
Watched MI 5 yesterday at MC platinum.. A very good movie indeed.. Rating = 7.5/10 #MI5
MI 5 is amazing movie.. If Tom got more amazing scenes to act... The movie would be more amazing. He is Man-Impossible(MI)
last day of the long weekend, i am going to watch MI:5 later =D actually wanted to watch a local movie but my father was meeeeeh, ok then
Fun #ManfromUNCLE movie "behind the scenes" segment before showing of MI:5 today. They also ran the SPECTRE trailer making it a spy trifecta
MI 5 is A Bakwass Movie 3,4 was far better! !!!
:cue Mission Impossible music: Time for the MI:5 movie. Oh yeah!

Ilsa Faust in MI:5 is like Furiosa in Fury Rd - a genuine equal to the male franchise star, and the movie's true protagonist/icon.
Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation very good, Minions Movie not so much @CineworldEdin but definitely see MI:5 as they should of called it!
Didn't get the chance to watch MI 5 on its premiere night @ SM Megamall because of the traffic so now I'm having a movie date night w/ cous
MI:5 is an blockbuster movie. Ekdum faadu hain boss Tom Rebecca with Simon r rocking. All 3 of them nailed it. #MissionImpossibleRogueNation

#MI-5,while being a complete paisavasool movie,is certainly not the best of the Series.But the franchise still has a lot left in it to go on
Movie night with the Fam Fam! MI:5 is easily one of the best action movies I've seen!… https://instagram.com/p/6JhfDvkQGn/ 
@Renner4Real What an amazing movie MI:5 is Please make the next film MI:6 in Japan If that comes true, I wanna appear in the movielol
MI:5: NON STOP. Good god this movie moved. It was an absolute blast, and definitely a good choice over Fant4stic. 4.75/5 stars
MI 5 what an epic movie! Tom cruise has been on a serious winning streak!
Saturday late night show MI-5 Rogue Nation. Amazing movie. Nice to see tom cruise in action after a long time. Loved it...

@kamaalrkhan @AkshayCIA Ha Ha pata nahi iss movie par log kyon paise waste kiye 44 lakhs :P #MI-5 dekhke paise wosool karo
I can neither confirm nor deny that MI:5 was a good movie without permission from the Secretary. #RogueNation
Wow. I wouldve enjoyed MI:5 a lot more without running commentary, guy. But thank you for taking four phone calls during the movie. Thanks
Sitting in movie theater waiting on MI 5.
@rabyeyo yaar mujhay bhi.Jana hai but priority per mi 5 and Ted 2 ki movie hai wo bhi dekhni hai
MI 5 was usual timepass only. Don't remember much from the movie although it ended only 2 hours ago.
Watched MI 5 yesterday's premier show and the movie was good,but I being a huge fan of BMW's, I loved BMW chase scene pic.twitter.com/dw8UuwSMJO
Mi 5- best movie in the series in my option. highlights- bike chase and the fast screenplay must watch. Cruise nailed his performance 4.25/5

@wikipediabrown @mrsundaymovies A lot of Star Wars talk last week, not a comic book movie. Don't do it. You've sold out. Loved the MI:5 talk
i want to watch mi-5 everyone seems to like it but ive never watched a single MI movie
MI:5 superb movie enjoyed it
If you guys already saw MI 5 and want to see a different movie see Shuan The Sheep Movie it will be more Entertaining then Fant4Stic
@sonialeano sorry to be the bringer of bad news here. :( :))) But I would suggest you watch MI:5 instead! :))) Better movie all around! :D
Arrange in Order of "Which Movie Will Collect More Tomorrow". Bangistan, MI-5, Banjrangi Bhaijaan, Drishyam.
In my spy movie, our heroes break into a factory of sorts in Morocco. Tom Cruise just did this in MI:5.... Fuck... #thieves
#Deadpool trailer looks fucking fabulous. After seeing MI:5 I'm going to have a summer long movie boner.
Way behind on summer movie watching. Still need to see Jurassic World, Ant-Man, MI 5, Trainwreck & Vacation. Suggestions on where to start?

@gorgeous8463 @marilesaca tsaka nagbasa ako ng movie reviews. panget daw. haha. MI:5 kaya? :)
Just saw MI-5 & one question comes to mind. Why isn't Miss Ferguson a Bond Girl yet? Such a pity since she steals the movie from Old Man TC.
After DBZ movie sneaked in to watch MI 5
Just finished MI:5. Good movie. Highly recommend it.
हिजो राती 12:39 सम्म MI:5 movie हेरियो अहिले उठ्न ढिला!!
Ok so... MI:5... AWESOME!!! I love a good action movie
During previews for MI 5, #13Hours teaser played & movie goers collectively groaned "Hillary Clinton!" Color me giddy!
Saw the screening of MI-5 today at PVR @SelectCITYWALK An absolute stunner & action packed movie Thanks to @mydala ! pic.twitter.com/RJwrmKaair
MI-5 Waiting for release this Movie and Go to see soon n PVR
@Renner4Real seriously, MI 5 was great fun! Hope you're loving filming your new movie because I want to see it right now! You rock
Ang ganda ng Vacation movie. Sobrang nakakatawa. Hahaha! Featured pa ang paborito kong kanta ni Seal. ^_^ Next week, MI:5 naman!!!
@FilmGeekArmy I'm not super late on this or anything lol I saw MI:5 and it was a fantastic movie. Hopefully Tom Cruise doesn't die in MI:6.
So many great moments in MI:5. If I listed them all I would just end up describing the whole movie.
#MissionImpossibleRogueNation is the perfect mix of the original MI movie and MI:5. Amazing action, gadgets, espionage, spy work
@5150ellis watching movie talk and now I have to watch the mi:5 spoilers review just to see your shirt... thanks Mark
@dsgruntled_goat I thought JW was the most "fun" movie this year, but MI:5 was my favorite movie this year (just ahead of Mad Max).
@MrCamW review of MI:5 nails it: a female spy movie for some reason told from the pov of the washed up male http://thepopcornjunkie.com/2015/08/03/review-mission-impossible-rogue-nation/ …
Also whoever did the casting for MI:5 has a dark sense of humor. Black Mirror S01E01 ka minister is minister in the movie.
Just got back from MI:5. It was a perfectly serviceable-to-good action movie. only a few things keeping it from great. I shall list them.
Saw MI 5 tonight with Brooklyn, Brandon and London...pretty sweet movie- gave it a "10" #tomcruise #alwaysgood #familymovietime
MI:5 was LIT. Dope movie
MI:5 was pretty good! I liked it better than 4 due to the villain actually having s presence in the movie. Last act was def the highlight.
@JD2TheFullest i wanna check out that vacation movie though and MI 5 looks lit
Say what you will about Tom Cruise, he's a fucking Movie Star. MI:5 was a great summer popcorn movie.
I feel bad that I haven't had a chance to @_TcmCruise's new movie MI:5. I'm so proud of you though.

We went to see MI:5 last night & saw the Benghazi movie trailer. I almost cried. I hope Bay does it justice.
MI:5 is so good. First one since the De Palma one that isn't satisfied with just being an action movie.
PSA: MI 5 is a good movie 9/10 go watch it
movie secen #MI:5#tomcrusie https://instagram.com/p/50Hb2_j77o/ 
Takjub sih kalao Ali Baba Movie Enterprise adalah salah satu pendana film MI:5 ini
Just saw MI-5. Great movie but weird how #TomCruise at 53 still looks like young Cruise but Alec Baldwin at 57 looks like he ate young Alec
MI:5 - what a ride!! And man, Tom Cruise is such a MOVIE STAR. His physicality is always so fun to watch. Fantastic script.
After the long time, planning to go for a #Movie #MI-5
The best reason to see MI 5 is Rebecca Ferguson. She owned this movie. #MissionImpossibleRogueNation
Really love the Mission Impossible series (minus 2 which was hot garbage) MI:5 right up there at the top. Great movie.
MI:5 = popcorn movie . 3.5 out of 5 popcorn buckets
MI:5 is pretty much as perfect as you could hope for in an action movie as far as staging but it's also really...cold.
Best thing about the new MI-5 movie is the 007 preview. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQJbF2CXLQ …
MI:5 is absolutely awesome. If you want a smart spy movie that is absolutely entertaining, this is for you. 9/10
Finished MI:5. Before it there was a trailer for Bay's Benghazi movie. In ~2hrs the republicans in here need to call their doctor. #priapism

Saw Trainwreck, Ant-man, and MI-5 this week. My movie budget's out of control; I guess only one of the boys is going to college this fall.
Think tomorrow's going to be a movie day - I'll squeeze in Inside Out and MI 5.
Movie date tonight! MI:5! WHOO!!
So with Kingsman, Spy, & MI:5 out now, & Man from U.N.C.L.E. & Spectre in the pipe, who knew this year would be the year of the spy movie?
i need another movie marathon to catch up with MI 5 hahahahaha crap! been a long time since i've watched mission impossible....
Zo always has a critique after every movie he watches. He's often too generous. But he's spot on with MI-5. https://twitter.com/sgtfawkes/status/627027924143706112 …
MI 5 Rogue Nation was pretty good. Still don't like that little midget Cruise, but the movie was free and me likely free.
MI:5 is a near perfect summer movie. Best of the series so far, great use of the cast and characters, gripping plot. #rougenation
MI-5 is my birthday movie choice Yeah Baby! I will be seeing it tomorrow night with my peeps! https://twitter.com/iTunesMovies/status/626799450321612800 …
I kinda feel Mi:5 and the new 007 are the same movie
CONTROVERSIAL OPINION: I think Tom Cruise is an amazing movie star, and despite his weirdness, I can't wait to see MI:5
MI 5, Karachi se lahore, Moor, Manjhi the mountain man, Shah, The fantastic four August the movie month
@TomCruise I loved MI-5, AWESOME movie!!! Much love from Israel.
I watched the movie MI 5 alone earlier and was more excited to watch it instead of Ant Man
Bout to watch the Premiere of MI:5 #movie #movies https://instagram.com/p/5we6X_HCxc/ 
My roommate just backed out of MI:5 and I straight up told her "Sorry not sorry I'm still going to see this movie." This is forever a thing.
Looking forward to catching MI:5-Rogue Nation soon.I do love a good big summer action movie!Its like Tom Cruise has the best stunts now!

@pizarrinha enjoy the movie #MI:5 @MissionFilm with @TomCruise at @uvk_multicines
Sounds like Paramount pulled off a #movie #marketing coup de grace w/highly publicized money shot for MI:5 http://ow.ly/QcqKR 
First MI: 5 reviews are quite good. Not surprising for a Tom Cruise movie. The man knows how to choose the right people to work with.
@TomCruise cant wait for the movie.. my most fav movie series is MI and you're undoubtedly the most fav actor :* MI 5 gonna be EPIC
Watching a Tom Cruise movie. Minority Report. Pumped for MI:5 Rouge Nation.
Vacation movie or MI 5? @LuigiM94
I've still got Straight Outta Compton, MI:5 and Ant Man on the movie list before summer is up.
@RedHelldiver and I've pre-ordered the MI-5 movie on blu-ray from amazon.uk. I take my obsessions very seriously.

Is it contractual requirement of any @TomCruise movie that he must hang from a train, plane or auto? Tom & MI-5 sadly feels like time warp.

Now we have a better idea of what @chrismcquarrie has been working on ...how ready are u for the new MI-5 movie....? https://youtu.be/gOW_azQbOjw 
Even though the hype is extreme, I don't think MI:5 will be better than Ghost Protocol. That movie was EVERYTHING.

My two favorite movie series of all time are Bond and Mission Impossible. The MI 5: Rouge Nation trailer may be the best I've ever seen!
That MI:5 trailer looks awesome. I'll never not watch a Mission Impossible movie.
Mi-5 is one of the greatest production of all action movie. This one is gonna make you feel like watch 1-4 in the same movie and more.

寝よう。。 @TomCruise I'd like to see your new movie early. Very pleasant. #MI:5
Kingsmen is a bad 60's Bond movie crossed with MI-5. Douchey lispy nemesis, great gadgets and clothes, unexpected principals die. Liked it.
Just watched Jack Reacher. Solid Cruise action movie. I think MI:5 is in good hands with McQuarrie.
Now that #DavidOyelowo is a Hollywood bigshot maybe we can have an "MI-5" (UK Spooks) reunion movie.
You know how the MI-5 people could fight back that production woes talk? Releasing a trailer, showing how it's a big movie & all's worth it.
Geeking out via text message with @Browncoat55 over the idea of a Spooks (MI-5) movie.

Watched the whole 1st ep of Spooks before I realized what it was (billed as "MI-5"). So, bonus: now I'll understand @jennifer_ehle's movie.

@reallisa If it's MI-5 on PBS, it's probably been butchered for time (for non-existant commercials!), so go to a movie.
Tough call. Watch old episodes of MI-5 or actually go outside, breathe air and go back inside to see a movie, ha ha

I watched MI 4 today (what an intense movie). I really hope there won't be an MI 5 -- tbh I did not enjoy a shirtless Tom Cruise.
Anil Kapoor tried too hard to play his role n thus failed.. Good to see some humuor in the movie as well. Will they make MI: 5? I think so!!
Recomendable la movie de MI 5 Protocolo Fantasma.Muy buena!!

Capt.David Niven, movie star and Commando, found himself in hot water with MI-5 British Counter Intelligence...
WOW!!! I found the new MI-5 movie trailer. @TomCruise @BillZucker and many more. It rocks!! http://youtu.be/n_h_pYN4Lcw
This police force in this Lifetime movie (besides Greg Grunberg) makes the Keystone Kops seem like MI-5. Totally ineffective.
@mjaseattle OMG you watched a movie! Watched MI-5 & could hardly keep eyes open! Then had trouble sleeping. Think my brain was overloaded.
a movie where the mi-5 hired crooks to break into a bank vault to steal photo's of a member of royal http://askp.me/30945
Rubicon premier 2: Writer fan of movie NO WAY OUT? References to "Yuri". Good show but no MI-5.
@Knightd427 Indeed, I exhausted MI-5 on DVR, 7 First Wave on DVR (syfy) & Leverage OnDemand. The movie Nomads in HD OnDemand is a must.
Another movie or more MI-5?

@m_ouse SPY movie where he would have bigger role than in MI-5. Terrific stuff:)
Nothing good on tv tonite. Tried to pick a movie on demand. Not in the mood for that. I prefer MI-5.
@KeiraSoleore I just mailed a disc bk today; have a movie on the queue for me and Scott (surprisingly, he is not as obsessed with MI-5 as I)
@FeroshaCoutura yep I looked his work up after P&P movie & now all MI-5 series in my Netflix :)
@BettyEllis I've seen the movie and I saw the play at the @huntington a few years ago. And I <3 Rupert Penry-Jones, thanks to MI:5. #pbs

Mussolini worked for MI-5 and a new movie on Agincourt - It's History Links of the Day! - http://endiscomingblog.com/?p=666
Was debating watching a movie, but I think maybe just another episode of MI-5.
Hmm....Hair, or the Listener? OR something from netflix instant? (ie: good quality movie or MI-5)
Mi-5 is so good :) never know who makes it thru or what will happen .. Like a movie ... #spooks :)

@mint910 that's too bad. Got to love netflix streaming. Not as much of a loss when a movie doesn't deliver. & there are 4 seasons of MI-5
Saw Ed Burns, Ben Kingsly and Danny from MI-5 in a made for TV sci-fi movie. SOLID!
Netflix Instant Movie View has pulled me off of Hulu. Better choices. Watching a little MI-5 now.
no more MI-5 tonight, i need to vegetate on their Changes, now a irish movie "The Committments", its....like the Full Monty.

@debracovell I'm jealous! I have to get through my current Netflix movie before I can start getting MI-5. Maybe I'll queue-jack @mmilani.

@Chris_Hunter - I love MI-5. I'm still in the middle of season four, but every episode is like a 60 minute movie. It's really good.
5 mins in to the first episode and officially addicted MI-5. Thank you, Netflix, for having available on Instant movie viewer!
I'm amused when I see Rupert Penry-Jones on MI-5(Spooks), and then see him in a movie based on Jane Austen's works.
