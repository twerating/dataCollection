My little conundrum at the moment is figuring out what my favourite Christmas movie is. Gremlins? It's a Wonderful Life? Christmas Vacation?

KRAMPUS would've been an adequate horror movie set in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION if not for about three too many awful endings.
Had a blast with KRAMPUS which succeeds in mashing up Christmas Vacation + Gremlins in humor and tone. Crazy to have this movie in theaters.

#VacationMovie AMAZING! Represented Christmas Vacation proud! I highly recommend! We laughed the whole movie! Can't wait until what's next
Favorite movie is National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, have to watch every Xmas! #ksedchat
@doris_roberts @imbevdangelo Beverly D'Angelo in Christmas Vacation. Great movie! pic.twitter.com/lWm1mHVgUm
Christmas Vacation is my favorite Christms movie, but #Fletch is Chevy's best movie. It captures his dickish humor better than anything.
I enjoyed Vacation but please don't remake Christmas Vacation. That movie was too damn good to be remade and even be on par with the first.
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a god tier movie
@ JohnFDaley @vacationmovie I want a Christmas Vacation 2 movie with this cast.Even if Netflix!If you don't, I'll write it myself!
I feel like out of respect for Christmas Vacation, I'm obligated to see the new Vacation movie
Fave movie genre? Comedy. Some faves: Jumpin' Jack Flash, Easy A, Christmas Vacation, Fletch, Caddyshack, Zoolander, Dodgeball & Spaceballs
