non-@ repost: Memento is a bad movie bc it spoils the ending within the first few minutes and Koyaanisqatsi isn't even a real film at all
Memento, but it's a sad movie about a guy looking back on how unfunny he was in Facebook memories.

Why are they remaking Memento? Don't remake a good movie! Remake a bad one and make it better. Christopher Nolan should be insulted.
What they should have done is put out a new Memento movie every 2 years with no reference to any previous versions.

@1013KDWB Memento is the movie that goes backwards chronologically.
#Memento is an early exercise in Christopher Nolan's career. It is not a movie meant to be remade. It works fine as it is like it or not.

The people who are remaking Memento (A Perfect Film) should never have been allowed to be in the movie business. #SayNoToTheMementoRemake
I might be wrong, but a remake of my favorite movie is like a kick in the ass There goes a good movie #Memento
I bet the gimmick to the MEMENTO remake is it’s going to be shot in reverse… so it’s kind of just a normal movie now.
Memento is a near perfect movie. Who in the right mind would try to mess with a Nolan movie???
Why remake #ChristopherNolan's #Memento for an audience with no short-term memory when the movie is perfect? Just rerelease in theaters
So.. they're remaking Memento, a movie that by all means, doesn't need to be remade due to the quality already being okay.
People whining about movie remakes such as Memento. Movies have been getting remade almost as long as movies have existed.
Like really? Remake Memento? That movie is amazing and how can you even remake it?
They're remaking Memento? FUCK I don't have a joke, I'm just annoyed that they're remaking a movie that would a sophomore in high school
Why ?? This movie is already perfect. "Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' to get a Remake. http://thr.cm/vwQr4w  pic.twitter.com/5SXwS5FHnf"
Why? MEMENTO is pretty much a perfect movie and only 15 yrs old? At this pt we'll b remaking movis from last yr soon https://twitter.com/thedarkhours/status/666389330387197953 …
Goddamn it, I am not old enough for them to remake a movie I saw in the theaters as an adult. #Memento
I imagine Memento is being remade because the head exec has "the amnesia" and movie overview tattooed on his body
I'd be more interested if the Prometheus sequel and the Memento remake were the same movie.
@QofTU It's ok - they're following the original movie by filming his school years and retirement. #Memento
Does Hollywood have so much money that they'd rather waste it on remaking a good movie than make movies we want to be made? #Memento
A movie about the decision to do a Memento remake would be more interesting. https://twitter.com/HueyJune/status/666407733222965248 … pic.twitter.com/o6itQZsWUG

Is Memento the only Nolan movie with swearing in it?
Wait. What if we all experienced it backward, and the Memento movie we've already seen IS the remake?
Are you saying that because Memento's been forgotten it's being done again? What movie does that remind me of, now? https://twitter.com/carnojoe/status/666358212157767680 …

I just heard some sad news They are remaking the movie "Memento". Why Hollywood?
So, guys, Memento is being remade because the entire movie industry has just jumped the shark. Come watch us on TV where we make new stuff.
Memento is great and its the textbook example of a movie that is better the 2nd time around.
Why must Hollywood remake every movie. Especially a movie as good as "Memento"
Why would you remake Memento? There's absolutely nothing wrong with that movie. pic.twitter.com/Weq1pDwTh4
So I just added Nolan's "Memento" movie to my watchlist.
A Memento remake is a really horrible idea. That movie is perfect and A Memento remake is a really horrible idea.
So, guys, Memento is being remade because the entire movie industry has just jumped the shark. Come watch us on TV where we make new stuff.
Memento, director Christopher Nolan's breakout movie, is already getting remade. The movie came out in 2000. Nolan is not involved right now
Memento is being remade, because it's a perfect, unique movie. Wait, what? http://on.io9.com/cjvHaUY  pic.twitter.com/SQJ6w8OdX4
AMBI Pictures is remaking Memento. Wouldn't it be a whole lot easier/cheaper to make a movie inspired by Memento??

Whomever is remaking Memento must have forgotten how good the original is. #movie #film
Instead of black & white (boooring!) the Memento movie we all deserve will cut back and forth from 2D to 3D (put on 3D glasses now!)
A remake for a 15 year old movie (Memento)? why
Memento remake: "I vaguely remember already watching this movie about vaguely remembering."
A Memento remake?! The original will still exist, right? -Yes. Then whatever. Best of luck, I hope they make a good movie.
Are they making another Memento because they forgot they already made that movie once? They need better memory tattoos.
For those who dont know, Christopher Nolan is pretty much remaking his own movie. He directed the original Memento. pic.twitter.com/fr6IcRsDP7
Wait, wait, wait. They're remaking Memento?? The movie isn't that old! And it's great as it is!
so theres talk of a remake of the movie Memento one more reason why i fall out of love with movies a lil more each day
MEMENTO is getting a remake. Will I need to tattoo the movie's title on my arm to remind myself to see it?
Well, I sure hope the Memento remake finally puts the movie in the correct order. http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/16/christopher-nolan-film-memento-to-get-a-remake … I'm kidding, please don't do that.

Dear Movie Gods, Do not let anyone remake Memento. Sincerely, People that love movies. #Memento
Who was the person who thought remaking Memento was a good idea? The movie is only 15 years old for gods sake!
They're already remaking Memento? I mean... I love that movie... and I kinda wanna be in the new one... But really, 15 years?
I get it #Memento was a beautiful movie. Please stop remaking movies that are less than 30 years old.

They're remaking Memento which came out in 2000, I repeat they are remaking a movie that came out when I was in HS I am too young for this.
Why remake a 2001 movie? There should be a time criteria on remakes. Will he be taking pics on his iPhone instead of a Polaroid? #Memento
For as good of a movie that it was, I'm pretty sure more people have seen more Tweets about 'Memento' than the actual movie.

Even if you don’t love Memento, there’s no way in the world it’s Nolan’s worst movie. That's “The Dark Knight Rises” https://newrepublic.com/minutes/123945/christopher-nolans-worst-movie-is-getting-remade …
Due to a unique form of memory loss, the producers of MEMENTO forgot they only made that movie 15 years ago... https://twitter.com/DrewAtHitFix/status/666370917493112832 …
Plot twist: The hook of the new Memento movie is a series of Vines.
remaking #Memento is really stupid.. why not drop all that cash to remake a good idea/poorly executed movie? or something (gasp) original
Movie Exec: "Ugh. Guy Pierce and Carrie Anne Moss are sooo early ots. Let's recast the Memento remake with Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche."
Memento remake will feature Guy Pearce in the lower right corner watching the movie with a baffled look.
If you're going to remake a movie that's only 15 years old then make it interesting. I say make it a silent movie in black & white. #Memento
Why is there gonna be a remake of "Memento"? That movie is PERFECT already!!!
#Memento remake? I FORGET (heyo) the last time a movie so aggressively didn't need 1. Leave original ideas alone, especially from Rav Nolan!
Movie Execs: "Why is part of this movie in color and part of it in b+w?? The new Memento will be ENTIRELY in color. And in IMAX. And in 3D."
They're remaking Christopher Nolan's movie Memento? On the upside, the marketing slogan writes itself: "You've seen this before."
So, they're remaking Memento? Really? Did they *sunglasses* FORGET how recently that movie was made? ...YEAHHHHHHHH
People remaking Memento realize it's only the character who loses his memory right away, right? We remember the movie we saw 15 years ago.
WHO THE FUCK IS TRYING TO REMAKE MEMENTO? The original is a top 10 movie all time. WHY?
The only tolerable excuse for remaking a movie is if it's obscure, very old, or previously based on a book. Memento is none of these things.
The best way to do a Memento sequel would just be to rerelease the original movie and call it a sequel.
Memento is a weird movie to remake since it's not a hot property or major IP and it's already an American movie in English.
Honestly, I'll shut up about it after this, Memento isn't a movie you can magically recreate. There's so much nuance and craft in it.

This industry will make me fall in love with a movie but never fails to make me furious about it later. A #Memento remake is a terrible idea
They're remaking Memento, a not-old movie about making mistakes over and over again.
My favorite movie doesn't need a remake. It was brilliant the first time. @rynmrshl told me to watch memento in college. Favorite ever since
@WTFangirlBlog whyyyyyyy? Why remake memento? It's a good movie but not exactly a plot I need to see done the same way again.
Memento is such a good movie we watched it in philosophy
Memento is an amazing movie that 100% does not need to be re-made however it does need to reach a bigger audience
What? Remaking Memento? If that movie ends any other way besides the lead character discovering he already starred in #Memento they f'ed up.
Oh hell yeah, they're remaking "Memento" and it's going to take a great, great movie and turn it into a giant goddamn dog turd.

Memento is absolutely not a good enough movie to get remade.

The Memento remake announcement is typical of when rights get purchased. Watch it be like the Buffy movie and never exist.
They’re remaking Memento? It’s going to reach a point where the headlines will be “Movie opening breaks record. Movie remake announced”
The movie Chris Nolan made right after Memento was a remake and it was really good
Memento is in my opinion as close as you can get to a perfect movie. It should not be remade.
So they are remaking Memento. The one Christopher Nolan movie I actually like......... Yes. I hated his Batman trilogy.
There is absolutely no justifiable reason to remake Memento. It's a perfect movie.
I'm not mad about the Memento remake. I love that we have an idea this laughably bad to help join all of movie fandom together.

Memento remake pitch:"What if we did Memento but in chronological order?" Movie Company: "That would be any other movie, what a great idea!"
Can we make a rule where you have to wait at least 30 years to remake a movie? Memento getting remade is ridiculous.

I’m pretty sure this MEMENTO movie can’t be a remake, since I don’t recall another movie with that name.
Movie about a director who is forced to remake MEMENTO because the producers have kidnapped her family.
Horrified to see that possibly my favourite movie of all time, Memento, is getting remade/ruined.
Memento trending is the death of me. I did a 5700 word philosophy essay on this movie, im so over this.
And Memento was based on Jonathan Nolan's short story so this new movie is more likely to draw from the short story than the actual film.

Memento was a perfectly good movie the first time I saw it in 2002. Was also great when I saw it, for the first time, in 2006

Memento is the one Nolan movie I like. Maybe it will be even better with another director! Although you can't improve on the original cast.
I just heard they're going to remake #Memento. But I forgot I heard it 15 minutes ago. If this makes sense to you, you'll love the movie.
I heard they're remaking the movie Memento. It's probably going to be really forgettable.
They're remaking Memento?! Okay, so I liked the movie, but I honestly do not think it deserves a remake, unless it's going to be made better
Hmmm #Memento remake? "Might as well announce the remake of a movie during the originals production" — Some guy. Couldn't agree more
MEMENTO just reminded me of another great Joe Pantoliano movie (pre-Matrix Wachowskis) called BOUND. With the wonderful @Jtillathekilla2.
Odd that they're remaking Memento considering it's not even really that old of a movie (2000). Plus, you can easily stream the original.
ME: They’re remaking “Memento,” is nothing sacred? HOLLYWOOD EXEC: Is “Is Nothing Sacred" a movie we can reboot?
Called it before. They're remaking Memento. MEMENTO for heaven's sake. How can you even think of perfecting an already perfect movie?
@caleweissman memento was a terrible movie and anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong
@JMintzHoops @HerringWSJ I appreciate Memento because it's the only Nolan movie along with Begins that isn't filled with condescending

I'm hoping this Memento remake news floating around is a troll, cause that movie is fine as is.
Everyone knows I'm a hard grader when it comes to films and I'd still give Memento 10/10. The perfect movie.
they should do a whole Memento universe. Teddy can get his own movie. Leonard can get an origin story. Burt can be the Guardians guy.
i really don't see a need for a new 'memento' movie when we have snapchat.

If there were a MEMENTO TV series in the works, that would be something interesting. But remaking the movie? No thanks.
@RyanPfeil Memento is my all-time favorite movie. It is simply perfect. The thought of a remake is ridiculous.
@Lil_SJL @Mo_Mata The special edition of Memento has an easter egg that allows you to watch the movie in chronological order. I recommend it
They cannot remake Memento. It's the perfect movie. Please!!
Why THE HELL would you remake MEMENTO??! WTF! Please go shit on a straight to DVD movie. Stop ruining good films with remakes.
@Cobbster15 rewatched memento for a film class.. i only remembered parts of the movie so the memory aspect of it was more interesting.
"Well, maybe they'll come around if we get Guy Pearce to play Memento's dad or something?" - probably someone at a movie studio right now
I *think* Memento was simply an okay film. Still, remaking a movie that's less then sixteen years old is kind of ridiculous.

Always felt weird when Hollywood remakes movies but seriously Memento? Why dies that movie need an update?
I was just talking about #Memento with the husband last night, trying to reverse engineer (??) the movie in chronological order.
Anyway, off to pitch my script for the new Memento, staying true to Nolan's vision of an edgy, iconic movie with a fish with lasers in it.
What's the deal with Memento? Do you trailer me? Am I a movie? Am I an actual park? Just what am I?
Why would you remake Memento? Sure it's not Psycho but still Why it's already a good movie. Go remake bad movies and make them good.
Hollywood: just quit and go home. The movie industry has zero creativity left. Now they're remaking Memento (which is only 15 yrs old)?

Memento was a good movie tho, leave it be
Remaking Memento...no. Just no. Also, I'm not paying to see the same movie over & over any more. Bring on something new or go home Hollywood
memento is the only Nolan movie i cant stand ,never could sit through it/finish it
It's called ruining a movie *sigh* - Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' to Get Remake http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/christopher-nolans-memento-get-remake-840587 … #memento
MEMENTO is a perfect indie movie that should be kept as such forever. It just feels like a really weird film to remake.
i can not imagine a movie less in need of a remake than fucking Memento
Reminder, if the number of people saying "Don't remake #Memento" actually refuse to see the completed movie, it makes a point.
I don't remember that movie RT @monkeyrotica: LOLWUT RT: Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' to Get Remake http://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ch … via @THR"
I'll never understand why people get so angry at the idea of a movie being remade. That said, I think it's WAY too soon for Memento.
Memento is not a movie you remake. https://twitter.com/misterpatches/status/666340310411288576 …
I try not to react angrily to movie news, but this time they are going too far. A remake of "Memento"??? NO!!! http://variety.com/2015/film/news/memento-remake-christopher-nolan-1201641515/ …
MEMENTO is a movie that purposefully doesn't add up/make sense, wrapped in a confounding gimmick. Please -- at least fix it.
Memento — a movie with a really great concept and endless possible directions — is the perfect choice for a remake, or “reimagining."
Silly Movie News of the Day: Memento? Really? What's wrong with the "old" one made just 15 years ago? http://variety.com/2015/film/news/memento-remake-christopher-nolan-1201641515/ …
Christopher Nolan's Movie 'Memento' Will Get a Remake http://dlvr.it/Clz7vJ 
please turn Memento into a DTV action movie starring Scott Adkins. Oh god please.
The good news is Chris Nolan could easily destroy the MEMENTO remake by opening his next movie against it.
LOL Good luck trying to remake Memento, Nolan already perfected that movie. Waste of time and money, do something better with your life.
@Borys_Kit CRUEL INTENTIONS feels like a movie that could actually be remade, even less than 2 decades later. MEMENTO is just illogical.
Exactly what's wrong with Hollywood - remaking a great movie in Memento that's just 15 yrs old. Just because. http://deadline.com/2015/11/memento-movie-remake-ambi-pictures-1201625561/ …

I think making a MENTOS movie would be a better idea than remaking Memento. #thefreshmaker
If you're gonna do a remake of Memento you better know what the hell you're doing. Up way high in my all time favy movie list.
Wow. They're really gonna remake Memento?!?!? I really hate most movie studios man. No need to remake that amazing film
The film industry is in the pits.A Memento remake!?!? Is Nolan directing it? WTH? How do you remake a movie that's not even 20 years old?
Wouldn't it make more sense for Memento to be done like a TV show instead of another movie?
Christopher Nolan's movie #Memento will be getting a remake! http://jus.tj/w9o  pic.twitter.com/xnqdSMOUcN

Apparently they're planning a remake of Christopher Nolan's Memento. Good thing too, because I've already forgotten what the movie's about.
Memento is still my favorite Nolan movie. Just re-release it.
Finally. Movie technology is at a place where we can get the true vision of Memento I guess. http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/christopher-nolans-memento-get-remake-840587 …
Re. MEMENTO: That movie is critically beloved, PLUS: Nolan fanboys!! How is name recognition going to help on any level here??
I went and saw Memento in a theater in a crappy area in Nashville. I don't know why a majority of the audience selected that movie.
Are we really remaking 'Memento,' people? It's been like 3 days since that movie came out.
I've seen Memento probably 20 times, so I'm a huge fan of the movie. I'm at a loss as to the reason for the remake.

The fact that @CWiZombie just referenced the movie Memento makes this my new favorite show
As much as how I already know how Memento was gonna end...that ending still confused me. What? Other than that, that was a great movie.
Memento is lowkey my favorite movie behind Pulp Fiction.
@animaldrumss when i lived in korea, the video store labeled a horror movie with seth green "memento 2" because amnesia was a plot element

Memento was so worthy of a Best Picture nomination at the Grammy's! I wanna fight the academy for not nominating the movie.
@becauseimjewish Memento is a terrible movie. Inception, even worse.

Memento was an Indy movie. Nolan did "Following", another Indy movie before. Crazy that he's like a top blockbuster movie director now.
When I watched Memento (2000 movie) in like 2004 ish, I thought he was great and should do more. Surprised he's the top guy now.
This is like the movie Memento, the black and white and color will meet up, maybe?
I love how #TheWalkingDead is patterning the episode off of the movie Memento

@LindseyByrnes Sounds similar to Memento which was an awesome movie! I'll have to wait till it airs in the UK as usual though! :(
Too bad she doesn't remember seeing the movie memento #blindspot
@PuddiSRC are you mad????? Why would I even randomly say that? Favourite movie is either Snatch, or Memento, Or V for Vendetta
I would probably really like that new show Blindspot because I loved when it was a movie called Memento.
memento or meet joe black OR someone suggest a movie for me pls
The movie #timelapse reminded me of a mixture of the movies #memento & #wickerpark

Movie marathon. Earlier: #Memento by Christopher Nolan. Now: #AshesOfTime by Wong Kar-Wai. Nice. Let's see what's next
I was hoping Nolan's next movie would be more like Memento or Insomnia, but that July release date almost guarantees another sci-fi.
Nolan's next movie is coming in 2017. I hope it's not an action/superhero movie. I just want him to do some original thriller like Memento.
Hopefully Nolan actually makes a semi small movie ala Memento/Insomnia next
Someone getting untied in a F.O.R. movie. This is like Memento. #trashtue

Reading one of the great movie scripts of our time, "Memento". Eager to finally watch the film for the first time 15 yrs after its release.
I guess my life is kind of like that movie 'Memento,' except I have a pretty good memory.
@Casa_Bey Usual Suspects, Se7en, Memento, The Departed, Intouchables (a french movie) are good movies, that you might not seen
Memento was a good movie that makes u think
speaking of which, I need to give Memento another watch. what a great movie.
The Prestige is a clever movie but I don't see why it's rated for many as Nolan's best work. Memento should be getting more love than it.
Perfect #movie #memento https://instagram.com/p/53IwDDpsNx/ 
@ATaraskiewicz Great movie! Fun when classical references pop up unexpected. I once saw a pinball machine inscribed with "memento mori" ....

Memento was a Chris Nolan movie about a guy with amnesia. Joke landed.
Memento should have had a series of flashes at the end that would make you forget you watched the movie.
Memento is such a good movie. 9/10.
Memento is one holy godsend emotions morale tingling movie
I forgot how good the movie Memento is.
@JamezWashington You should watch the movie memento...just tattoo jokes all over...Might make it harder to catch joke thiefs, tho. :/
Memento is the only movie which you can play the story line backwards & it would still make sense.

What I really hope is that his next movie is a lot smaller scale like Memento or The Prestige.
Om man tycker det är svårt att hänga med i True Detective (S1) eller Memento kan man ju försöka se The Lego Movie
I feel like I live in the movie MEMENTO. I now take pictures to remember. Which is great until you realize you left your iPhone somewhere.
Just got done watching Memento, makes me want to watch it again to understand it more. Christopher Nolan's first breakout movie.
Memento is a good movie , even though I was confused at first
I still haven't recovered from Memento to handle seeing Guy Pearce in any other movie.
This nation is currently in a 'Memento' state. If u ever seen that movie you'll know why

I just watched the movie Memento and now my brain hurts
Finally saw Interstellar, not sure where it falls on my Nolan movie rankings. Probably somewhere between 1. Memento and 2. Inception.

I love psychological thrillers more than any other movie genre (sixth sense, the prestige, shutter island, inception, memento, etc)
So Memento movie.....the the heck! Still trying to figure it out! #mind boggling
The movie "Memento"....but I just tattoo reminders that McDonalds breakfast burritos are not good
I wish I had a DVD player. Special edition of Memento has an option to play the movie backwards, and of course I mean forwards.

Memento, much to my disappointment, was not that good of a movie. I don't recommend it.
Memento by Christopher Nolan - One of a kind movie with 2 timelines and 1 of it is presented backwards. It kept us glued to the screen.
Predestination makes you think, it joins The Prestige and Memento (my favorite movie) as films I recommend whole heartedly and will rewatch.

the movie Memento is the biggest plot twisters ever, the movie is basically going backwards. My brain has never been so messed up.
"Badlapur" looks lot like "Memento" movie. A man trying to avenge his dead wife and people using his vengance & problem for there own
Memento might be the most confusing movie I've ever seen
Inception? Interstellar? Memento? The Dark Knight? Nah, the Prestige is hands down Chris Nolan's best movie.

What is this movie Memento and why does it seem like everyone knows what it is except me
The movie Memento literally blew my mind….
If you think Interstellar's a deep movie, you should watch Nolan's other film, Memento. It's sure to squeeze your brain.

Memento. A movie which basically just a cinematic example of the word 'mindfuck'. But wow. What an example. 9.1/10.

watching memento for the first finally. 25 minutes in and it is a crazy movie but enjoying it. #fb
Watched Memento again today. So fucking amazing, love that movie.

Verdict: MEMENTO. Good? Yes! Confusing? Yes! More confusing at the end? Oh yes it was! Great performances by Guy Pearce & Carrie-Anne Moss.
Christopher Nolan is honestly overrated. Memento is his best movie and the Batman movies are pretty good but everything else is shit

#IWillBeReturningThis dvd of MEMENTO. They put the movie on the disc *backwards* for fuck's sake.
This memento movie is confusing me.
Christopher Nolan is the best movie director...Inception, The Prestige, The Dark Night, Interstellar, Memento, and Insomnia are dope movies
@MsPageOsborne Trin and I just finished watching Memento. that movie is messed up. I'm angry.
Memento is a weird movie
An hour in, @mrs_renfrow is still into the movie Memento. A good sign.
Memento is literally the most insane movie I have ever seen.
What was the last movie you watched that was really good? — I rewatched Memento for the 6th time yesterday. http://ask.fm/a/bh7f9pqo

@Rataiczak24 I believe the Prestige is Nolan's best movie. You should also check out Memento. Nolan is a genius.
TimeHop is a great reminder for high school Alex's dependence on Facebook status quoting the movie Memento.
What was the last movie that made you think? — Memento (directed by Christopher Nolan) http://ask.fm/a/bjnnnbp4 
You need to have a good short term memory to follow this Memento movie. Ironically.
Another mind-blowing movie n_n ★ Memento — https://path.com/p/1URzKl 
Has anyone seen the movie Memento? Its pretty great.. Kinda trippy though.
Yeah my life is kind of like the movie Memento except I'm constantly trying to not forget about Dre
I have never understood the movie Memento as much as I do right now. Which is like... 30% maybe.
Saw "Memento" by Nolan today. Awesome movie. Didn't have time for Gone Girl so I'll make up with Pulp Fiction and Rocky Horror Picture Show.
you know what pisses me off is someone put up a whispering corridors movie on yt and said it's memento mori (they also said comedy but you
How have I not seen the movie Memento yet?? What a crazy story
"The One I Love" is a trippy movie. Like Memento. It's on netflix folks. 78% on the Rotten tomato scale

I have become emotionally attached to the movie Memento
Remembering random shit days after a con. My life is like the movie Memento
@fangredhead I watched Interstellar. Not my favorite Christopher Nolan movie (that would be Memento), but decent.
Holy plot twist in memento. That movie was way too much for my brain capacity
" @MajinDookie: Someone give me a good movie to watch" memento , it really caught my eye
@Joseph_Salomone sweet. Memento is great. End Of Watch is pretty good. That movie is the epitome of terrible bad guy shooting.
Someone please tell me they have seen the movie memento
Its shorter than a whiskey ad. Great actors stuck in what feels like a tv movie. Rather watch Memento again. Pass. 5/10 #BeforeIgoToSleep
Memento is weird. Not my type of movie. I really prefer The Conversation for psychological suspense.
One of Zimmer's soundtracks already. And together with Memento Nolan's best movie so far.... http://fb.me/76ekePB2b 
memento is a dope ass movie
I woke up in that movie Memento—except, instead of a murder, I'm trying to figure out how this jar of peanut butter ended up in my bed.
15 minutes left of the movie memento and I think I know the deal. I guess we'll see.
Cloud atlas~best movie ever, besides memento, or t2, or pitch perfect, or the dark knight
Just finished watching Memento: the most brilliant yet mind blowing movie I have ever seen. #irecommendit
Watching Memento again. Such an outstanding movie. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!

Best movie endings; 1. Se7en 2.Memento 3.Empire Strikes Back 4.The Prestige 5.Original Planet of the Apes
“ @thejudeodeh: Quote this with your favorite movie” Memento, The matrix, Inception, Batman sequel
Why yes Cole i do enjoy that reference to memento. I did love that movie
So this movie Memento is actually good
I feel like memento is Nolan's most overrated movie, it's good, but ain't that good.
So Leonard killed his wife in Memento? Otherwise the movie wouldn't make sense, right?
@Producer_Paige says Memento is a great "forgotten" movie. Is she right? What are your picks? Let @tonykatz know.

@mistrscoops Inception had a good amount of plot holes too. That being said I love that movie a lot. I still gotta watch Memento though.
Memento is a pretty incredible movie if you haven't watched it, watch it. Christopher Nolan's best work for sure
Nolan is a legend! Following, American History X, Memento. What a lovely movie weekend!
@fictional memento. Best movie ever.
fuck the movie Memento. seriously I'm so angry. also fuck the movie Se7en.
@420withjesus Definitely. If you're into mind-blowing movies, btw, check out Synechdoche New York and Memento (which is also a Nolan movie).
memento is a such a crazy movie
Memento is also the only Nolan movie I've watched more than once, as far as I can remember.
@eddyfate I'll wait until it hits Netflix, but I realized that the only Christopher Nolan movie I like unreservedly is Memento.
Movie : Memento Ratings : 4.8/5 Comment : *sakit otak*
@pizzazgabor i like to think that because it was nolan's first movie that isn't a psychological thriller or memento, he just…fucked up
But anyway, I think Nolan should just make films that don't explain themselves in-movie. A tru mind-bender. Like his earlier work 'Memento'.
Just finished watching Nolan's "Memento". This movie is fucking sick. FAKING SICK.

#Interstellar- If we find any fault in this movie, its not with the film, but with us.. Trust me, #Memento taught me this lesson. #Nolan
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there". Memento is such a good movie.
@NextToSRK @ShivangChauhans u talking about Memento?the movie that led to discovery of 'Ghajini';p
If you've never seen the movie memento your missing out. It's always been a favorite
Holy crap, did not know the MEMENTO Blu-ray was OOP. If tonight's DVD rewatch makes me finally like the movie, I'm gonna be pissed
Just watched Memento for the first time. Damn. What a movie.
If you watch the movie Memento backwards it's just ok....nothing original.
I want to watch Memento again, it's such a good movie.
It ruins all of Memento for me, since the movie comes down to an explanation of an event.
Watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the other day. Closest movie to Memento I've yet seen, and that's a compliment.
@AlecButModarn anyway, yeah, Memento is my favorite movie of his with The Prestige coming in at a second.

INTERSTELLAR is a good Christopher Nolan movie but not his best. The mindfuck factor is mild compared to Memento or Inception
Memento is easily Christopher Nolan's funniest movie. "What's the last thing you remember?" "My wife..." "That's sweet." "...dying."
"I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone." Ugh memento is such a good fucking movie
@xskywlkr Memento. After you watch that hit me up for another dope movie & every time you want another I gotchu bruh, Imma vault! #Bruiser
I'm watching Memento. I took all your suggestions into my mental movie list.
@Dental_Daniel @X18RAJ @TimeLapse_Movie Memento is amazing need to revisit that movie sometime! Love the non-linear narrative!
@a76r @X18RAJ @TimeLapse_Movie there's a hint of Memento to it, and nice of director to tweet me after praising the film; and it was good.

@makegoodjoyces Christopher Nolan's newest movie, he made the Dark Night trilogy and Memento. Its about space and stuff, kinda rad
Memento is such a good movie

@DilllPick so basically Chris Nolan films: Memento, Prestige, Inception, Interstellar. And the the greatest movie of all time: DARK KNIGHT
Memento is Nolan's best movie and if you disagree then I will slug it out with you
@MistyHewett did you see the “Meet the movie press on schmoes know network? One critics said he only liked memento of nolan movies.
I've seen Memento about 5 times now and damn it never ceases to amaze me. Such a good movie
Watching Memento interesting movie can't quite get the sequence yet anybody understand it?
"Just because I don't remember doesn't make my actions meaningless." Good god, Memento is the best movie ever.
Final movie fun: What's the gaping plot hole in "Memento" that Chris Nolan was aware of, seeing as it wasn't in his brother's short story?
