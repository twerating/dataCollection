Everyone agrees Die Hard qualifies as a Christmas movie, right? So, going by that criteria, does Jaws: The Revenge pic.twitter.com/zJBXMlsIXZ
@LoLDaleth The 4th movie in a series is always the BEST. Jaws: The Revenge, Phantom Menace, Alien Resurrection, Shrek Forever After
The best Christmas movie always has/will be Jaws: The Revenge.
What's the last movie you watched? — It was Jaws: The Revenge so I'd better watch something else in case I die http://l.ask.fm/igoto/45DKECN75V62DDAUPY6IQO6H6CFCTIQIUP7OLBUTC34KZYNPZIR5C6I6OEEI6FTQJC2P6FIAIFXDGV2RQF3LEJ5YPXVJZAR3UQDRNBAACZ2T6MXEB6HXYOHWTSMPBXTSTC6YCTQF23NHXFMJBOBB6QK46PGHLYM4ZDPVJMTFQOY2M264G5XHXXGEVEDIZQPAQEQIIEKBXBIMVF2DIR6Q==== …

Among all the dumb decisions, why did they call the movie Jaws: The Revenge and not Jaws 4 where the font of 4 looked like a shark fin?

@AoSHQBlog People trying to make the dumbest shark movie still get outclassed by Jaws: The Revenge.
PETA commercials while I'm watching Jaws: the revenge, the movie in which a roaring shark gets exploded. Sweet Irony.
@Al_Rob_1982 jaws the revenge greatest movie ever made
Wow, “Jaws, The Revenge” is terrible, I mean laugh out loud, terrible, a sort of horror-comedy movie
@jodamico1 @kenlowery Imagine being told Mario Van Peebles and Michael Caine are in a movie together, then imagine it's Jaws The Revenge.
My copies of Jaws 3D and Jaws: The Revenge somehow survived my DVD cull. Can't resist the dark alchemy of a shithouse movie it seems.

@xbreannaleighh well first one is a classic. Second is OK. Third was a 3-D movie and is bad. Last one (Jaws the Revenge) is just awful
@mauimkj @Crimson_Smiles I think that was Jaws The Revenge. But could be this too. Never seen the whole crappy movie.
@FreeCandy_44 have seen jaws the revenge (4)? maybe worst movie ever made. including a shark that makes dinosaur noises when attacking.
You may speak to me about Jaws, Jaws 2, and Jaws: The Revenge. Don't you DARE mention Jaws 3-D to me. I don't like that movie. @AkulaEcho
@Itybitybean The first horror movie I ever saw in theaters was Jaws: The Revenge, and because I was 8, I thought it was a masterpiece.

@Wings1295 I read the novelization of Jaws: The Revenge. It was far better than the movie!
Jaws: The Revenge was such a biased movie. What was the shark’s side of the story?
"Jurassic World" doesn't look as bad as "Jaws...The Revenge" but it still looks like a shitty sequel to an amazing Spielberg movie.
Just after listening to the Jaws: The Revenge episode of @MovieCrypt while watching the (sigh) movie. @TheJoeLynch @Adam_Fn_Green
Ain't no way Mario Van Peeples character was supposed to survive at the end of Jaws: The Revenge. Movie was so fluke lol
I'm watching Jaws: The Revenge. Why did the movie studio want revenge on us? What did we do to deserve this?

@JessicaClackum LOL. That is my go to movie when I want a laugh. I think about the craptasticness of Jaws the Revenge

Plan 9 From Outer Space is not the worst movie ever. Jaws the Revenge is. Because it was made by people who knew better.
It's a reference to the movie Jaws: The Revenge, in which the shark hunts down Martin Brody's friends and family because of a voodoo curse.

I would sincerely hope that every time those who made Jaws: The Revenge movie see it on TV they say outloud: "I'm sorry"
@AMC_TV I am offended that you would think I'm stoned enough to watch a terrible movie like Jaws the Revenge at 3:30 am
Jaws The Revenge is one of the worst, most cynical movie sequels ever made. The question is, do I stay up until 1:45 am to watch it?
Why does Jaws even need a fourth movie? "Jaws: the Revenge" Sharks aren't vengeful. Besides, they've kill Jaws like, 3 times already.
I wonder if @MarioVanPeebles misses his dreds from Jaws:the revenge. This movie is epic. Mario, this time, it's personal. #FishBants

The worst thing about the movie "Jaws: The Revenge" is that they cast Sir Michael Caine to play a character named "Hoagie."

I finally came across a movie that I saw when I was seven and it scared and ruined my whole summer. Fucken Jaws The Revenge smh
A million ways to die in the west is quite possibly the worst movie since Jaws the Revenge. Hope Ted 2 makes me 4get this steaming pile.
Michael Cain does crazy well. Almost makes this movie watchable ... and forgive him from Jaws the Revenge #starhorrorfest
I like the Movie Jaws I Like the Film Jaws 2 Jaws 3 was sadly rubbish and Jaws the Revenge was Poo #NationalPoetryDay
"Jaws, The Revenge" is on. It's just like "Jaws" except without a great director, movie star power and a plot.
For some mysterious reason, I am watching Jaws: The Revenge (aka Jaws 4). I feel bad for the actors in this movie.
Most unnecessary sequels ever made: 1. Jaws: The Revenge. 2. Jaws 3-D. 3. Jaws 2. It's a one-and-done kind of movie. #Jaws

Watching Jaws: The Revenge on AMC. Great movie.
Never seen it, but I feel Jaws The Revenge deserves a spot on my movie shelf sight unseen. @ShitMovieFest @DinosaurDracula whatsayyou?
“ @bena_r: @gatmanuk1 Watching Michael Caine movie when he was still a "young guy" #Jaws:The revenge” Must've been a long time ago !

Jaws is a great movie but Jaws: The Revenge is a big fuckin disgrace to all of humanity!!
@TheAnorak I believe that’s called “breaching”, based on my extensive knowledge of the movie Jaws: The Revenge.
@brentnichols @rosskerievsky That's "Jaws: The Revenge." My first published movie review in the State Press. I gave it 3 thumbs down
@RMJPodcast what movie would you rather be stuck watching until the end of time, Batman & Robin or Jaws the Revenge?

Uwe Boll needs to do a movie version of Jaws: The Revenge: The Video Game. I want to go through that looking glass.

Well at least Studio Universal is showing the movie "Jaws" in the correct order! ( Jaws, Jaws 2, Jaws 3, Jaws : The revenge )
Watching "Jaws The Revenge" and quite possibly, it's the worst movie ever made. Can't believe Michael Caine was in it
Wow this movie is taking the plots of Jaws: The Revenge", "The Fog".... a bunch of movies and just mucking it all up, #GhostShark

@monty_ashley @dloehr In high school we did a bad movie fest. Leonard, Jaws the Revenge, Ishtar..,
I've counted the lack of revenge in the movie "Jaws: The Revenge". And it's a whole lot of not revenge.
@giteshpandya Michael Cain, when talking about Jaws: The Revenge, said he hadn't seen the movie, but he had seen the house it built.

@alltime10s Just a suggestion but Top Ten Sequels that Killed the Movie Series'. Like Jaws the Revenge or Indiana Jones 4
"Jaws The Revenge" was nominated by the Razzies for "Worst Movie of the Year" but it lost to "Leonard Part 6"
That is probably the first almost positive movie review of "Jaws: The Revenge" i have ever seen

@carolinaa_rojas Jaws: The Revenge is the greatest shark movie ever. Sharknado comes in at a close 2nd
@jeremypiven @lousileno Michael Caine on Jaws: The Revenge "didn't see the movie, but I saw the house the movie built. It was breathtaking."
Of course, if I want to see a ridiculously plotted, terribly done shark movie I do have Jaws: The Revenge on my hard drive...
Retro movie evening watching Jaws: The Revenge !
Solid Friday night family movie - Jaws: The Revenge
"Jaws: the revenge" is probably the worst jaws - themed movie ever. :-) @Christ_Monkey
This may be the best movie ever made: "Jaws - The Revenge". #7Mate
The funny thing about #Sharknado is that it lacks the self awareness of Birdemic. Finally there's a shark movie worse than Jaws: The Revenge
Bloodier than a Tarantino movie. And yet still managed to make Jaws: The Revenge look like Kill Bill. #SharkNado
C'mon people, the movie's called #SharkNado, you didn't expect it to be a masterwork did you? I mean really, it's no Jaws: The Revenge
make fun of it all you want, "sharknado" is a better movie than "jaws: the revenge"

Let me also quickly apologize to everyone in the world, for just referring to Jaws: The Revenge and calling it a "film" and not a "movie."

I consider every Michael Caine movie a prequel to Batman Begins.... Especially Jaws the Revenge
Today is also the 25th anniversary of JAWS: THE REVENGE, the movie that forever proved that sharks hold grudges.
It somehow feels like this whole movie is just people shouting verbal abuses at sharks http://is.gd/1dMwR2  #NowShowing Jaws:The Revenge
Contrary to rumors, the movie will not explain the real reason Michael Caine did JAWS: THE REVENGE.
if i only ever could've worked on one movie, it'd be jaws: the revenge. i think that'd be a weird career legacy.
Guys, never forget, Michael Cain was in Jaws: the Revenge, a movie with a roaring shark
#nw jaws the revenge and anytime u c 1 black man in the movie, u know he's in trouble smh. Sure 'nough, he got the worst death smh

The sad part is, Jaws IV is someone's favorite movie for the wrong reasons. Jaws the Revenge is pure Cynema.

In fact, it was that bad, I might just watch Jaws the Revenge to cleanse my shark movie pallet.
I'm not sure if there's a movie that goes to the "it was only a dream!" well more than JAWS: THE REVENGE.
Tonight's movie is The Assassination of Richard Nixon! I've never seen it before but it MUST be better than Jaws: The Revenge was!! #Movies
was not impressed with "Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie" at all. Watched "Jaws the Revenge" for something with better charater development
Attempting to watch Jaws the Revenge - may fall asleep half way through - usual trick for a Friday night movie!
Jaws: The Revenge. Now theirs a classic movie if ever there was one. #imtalkingbollocks
Film on TV called Jaws: The Revenge, I initially read it as Jews: The Revenge, what a movie that would be hahaahhaahahah
Jaws the Revenge... The 3rd best / 2nd worst Jaws movie.
Upcoming blog project: an Adventures in Atrocity post on JAWS: THE REVENGE, which is my least favorite movie of all time.
@marksemczyszyn You've inspired my next movie marathon with my mates - shark films - off to hunt for Jaws: The Revenge
@andrew_shaw23 @Danger_Morris That's right! I've seen Jaws: The Revenge and NOT Karate Kid. Or ANY Rocky movie. My priorities = in order.
@ZachWKelly I know, but it's sharks. Jaws: The Revenge is PG-13 and that is my favorite god-awful movie of all time.
@philmold @EmShadows I was 11 for Jaws 3(D), and Jaws The Revenge is a steaming turd of a movie! lol
I'm reading all the tweets about Jaws 3. If people think that's an awful movie, I have three words for you: Jaws. The. Revenge.
Jaws 3 is trending?? Haha! It's pretty shitty, but it looks like a Fellini movie compared to Jaws: The Revenge. #fact
Jaws 3 Not a great movie, but not a total disaster. Kind of dull, Jaws the Revenge was worse.
Jaws 3 trending worldwide lol. You think #Jaws3 is the worst movie ever? Wait till you watch Jaws: The Revenge (Jaws 4)
The sad part is, that somewhere out there, Jaws the Revenge is someone's favorite movie.
Movie of the day: Jaws The Revenge http://lnk.ms/SJ3JP 
Not even JAWS: THE REVENGE? RT @scalzi THERE IS NO WORSE MOVIE THAN HIGHLANDER 2: THE QUICKENING.
Terkadang film-film yg di cap kritikus sbg worst movie jadi guilty pleasure buat gw: Jaws: The Revenge, Mommie Dearest, Batman & Robin
@TheComedyButton what about Jaws: The Revenge for a movie commentary, that movie needs one
. @matildahare: I just ruined that accent. Me: Yes. Jaws: The Revenge was the perfect movie and your accent has RUINED IT! #wereoldandsleepy
Just watched the last 30 minutes of Jaws: The Revenge. I can't believe that movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards.

How did Jaws the revenge only get 1 star movie is legit
I'm watching Jaws: The Revenge. Maybe that theory from PCU of there always being a movie on with Michael Caine or Gene Hackman is true.
Who knew Jaws The Revenge was a Christmas movie. #hubbyhastheremote
"Jaws The Revenge" just might be the worst reviewed movie of all time. Maybe it's because the shark rawrs at the end.

So did Jaws: The Revenge completely ignore Jaws 3's existence or what? I hate when sequels do that. Still a fun movie though.
@MasterWuggles @xerostyle Sounds hilarious, it's either that or JAWS: The Revenge, Surf Nazis Must Die or a Nicholas Cage movie.
Watched Jaws:The Revenge last night w/ @kattmoff. If this movie has taught us anything, it's that sharks harbor grudges for a long time.
