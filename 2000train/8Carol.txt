Movie Review. Carol. Essentially Cool Runnings with less snow and more sexual tension. DO NOT BE FOOLED. It is not about Karel Poborsky.
A Christmas carol is my favorite Christmas movie

George C Scott, however, is not a great Scrooge in my opinion (1984 Christmas Carol). The movie looks decent but..HE HAS AN AMERICAN ACCENT!
Alastair Sim is simply brilliant as #Scrooge in the 1951 version of 'A #Christmas Carol'. Full movie here: https://youtu.be/lRrlurEKg1w 
I read so many reviews of Carol that I forget who said that it feels like it's set inside a movie from the 1950s.
Seeing CAROL tonight...
Muppet Christmas Carol is the best Christmas movie and no one can tell me otherwise
This comes to mind whenever someone talks about the movie Carol now http://youtu.be/_nTpsv9PNqo 
I feel like Carol will be the only thing on my mind until I finally see the movie.
Almost movie time! The Muppet Christmas Carol!!
It's a Wonderful Life is my favorite Christmas movie, followed by Christmas Vacation, Christmas Story, A Christmas Carol w/George C Scott
the original Christmas carol movie is really good even tho it's in b&w
Really want to see 'Carol', but don't think I know anyone I could convince into seeing a bleak period lesbian romance movie...
Just about to start another movie my husband hasn't watched: Jim Carrey's- A Christmas Carol. #bahumbug #SkyMovies #ChristmasMovies
@Ducks_SHR4 @CassadeePope Christmas Carol is a classic Christmas movie

Second look at "Carol." I still don't really connect with the drama but the craft is exquisite and it's a wonderful movie to just sit with.
@blankemon "'to carol", lesbian sex act, after the movie Carol" ( urbandictionary)
@akstanwyck @thehatefuleight ask him if he liked Carol or if it's another Cate arty movie!
A Christmas Carol is a powerful movie. The way scrooge's actions impacts everyone else.
My #Carol movie plans were canceled tonight, but I saw #VictorFrankenstein this morning so I still got to see a gay film today. Yup.

"I think they're more alike than you think. I mean, they had that whole favorite movie in common." - Carol, #TheLastManOnEarth
me watching any movie: "is this carol"
If you see one movie this year, make it #Carol.Gentle sighs, poignant pauses, silent tears,(that was just the audience). Ms Blanchett slays.
@hattersarts oh man but you have Carol already! Which, while I haven't seen it yet I'm sure it is a much better movie all around.

@sami_carol and eat sugar plums!! (literally have this movie memorized)
I'm going to fall in love with Carol along with Therese when I watch this movie aren't I
@htedoc you need to watch the movie "the grinch" or "a Christmas carol". you may find them enlightening.
i found a golden films-esque christmas carol movie- OH MY GOD TIM CURRY VOICED SCROOGE
@dark_dancer2008 Several of my favorites are different versions of the same movie, "A Christmas Carol".
Christmas Movie Night - 1 - Disney's: A Christmas Carol, with the love @ashleylauren318
Few movie scenes enrage me quite like when Sarah ditches super hot Carol who adores her to take care of her brother in Love Actually.
If people can count “Die Hard” as a Christmas movie then damn it I can count “December, 1963 (Oh What a Night!)” as a Christmas carol
@blythe_russo #blythesholidaygiveaway absolute favorite holiday movie would be "It's A Wonderful Life" then, "A Muppet's Christmas Carol" :D

"A Muppets Christmas Carol" has gotta be the most under-appreciated Christmas movie of all time
Polar Express, Elf, Grinch, Christmas Carol, Santa Clause, Charlie Brown Christmas...really the same movie far as I'm concerned
Which movie is better? Mickey's Christmas Carol vs Charlie Brown's Christmas.
The best Christmas movies are "It's a Wonderful Life" and "A Muppets Christmas Carol." Every other movie is either entertaining or overrated

For my money, no Christmas Carol *movie* has ever topped the Muppet version. It's poignant, sweet and funny, with some actual gravity
Watching Its a Wonderful Life. and Disney's Christmas Carol. Amazing animated movie!
Carol is my new favourite Christmas movie
No competition. Carol is the best movie I saw all year. Todd Haynes has done it again.

Disney's a Christmas carol may be the creepiest movie I've ever seen
The newest Christmas Carol movie should really rethink its genre and fall under "horror."This shit is scary.
Disney's A Christmas Carol is definitely not a kids movie. So dark! But I guess it's not really a kids story to begin with.
yea it's a kids movie all I'm sayin is don't watch A Christmas Carol alone
Hasn't even been that long since its release, yet the animation in that Jim Carrey "Christmas Carol" movie already looks dated.
Disney's A Christmas Carol is still too scary for me to watch at 22. Who is this movie made for?
A Christmas carol should be a Halloween movie for how creepy it is...

Carol: I haven't been so softly moved by a movie in a long time. Real, slow beautiful love on film - we just don't see it enough. Stunning.
7 minutes in watching a (not)horror movie - second jump scare and i had to switch over to Muppets Christmas Carol instead
Another thing, #TheWalkingDead: why do the women keep doing that stupid horror movie trope of falling down? Carol??? SERIOUSLY??

@noviadeldoctor1 Muppet Christmas Carol. I like Die Hard but it's not a Xmas movie just because it's set at Xmas
My ultimate favorite Christmas movie "A Diva's Christmas Carol" just came on..I faithfully watch it every year.
A DIVAS CHRISTMAS CAROL IS ON!!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
CAROL up next
"any latest movies to watch fr ur pc?" "natm" "how abt that 'Carol' u were watching the other day?" "it's just a clip fr the movie" #busted
CAROL, go see it. Great movie. Great clothing, make up, and sets.
If "carol of the bells" is supposed to be a Christmas song, why it sound like it just came out of a horror movie??
I wish I was Carol from the movie Carol starring Carol.

@DeesseAfriq I've never wanted a kid to die in a movie or show this bad, I hope it's gruesome too lmao Morgan aggy but it's good Carol alive
Pretty sure Carol is on the wrong show, #IntoTheBadlands doesn't come on until after bro She can't just be Ninja movie like that #twd
"Carol" is my favorite Christmas lesbian movie.
How does badass Carol fall down running on a sidewalk like a horror movie virgin in the woods?? @TalkingDead_AMC #TalkingDead #deadlive
Carol trips, Maggie trips. Everyone went full on blonde girl in a horror movie here. #TheWalkingDead
Carol tripped? Must be dat arthritis because she ain't no horror movie trope #DeyWalking #TheWalkingDead #PFTWD
Carol did the obligatory white woman falling in a horror movie/show thing. I'm scared, ya'll. #PFTWD #DeyWalking
Noooo Carol just pulled a classic horror movie move #TWDMidSeasonFinale

4yo's review of Muppet Christmas Carol: "I can't believe I watched a whole Christmas movie without Santa in it."
for some reason i thought Carol was about a journalist and richard nixon so it was quite a surprising movie

@anne_theriault It's definitely the best Christmas Carol movie -- and also closest to the actual story.

Saw the movie 'Carol' tonight, what a superbly crafted piece of film that is...stunning!
The movie of 'Carol' completely botches the character of Therese & the ending of the book.
Patricia Highsmith, Cate Blanchett & Todd Haynes are awesome combination. Carol is a fabulous movie. Tho not everyone in the cinema agreed.

@AllEdEverything Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol is the best Christmas movie.
Took a quiz to pick which movie I should see this weekend & damn if it did not choose #Carol. You don't understand..it IS NOT PLAYING HERE!
Update: Carol of the Bells is playing and he's now looking for a movie on Netflix
Just watched A Muppets Christmas Carol and remembered as a child I thought gonzo was hot in that movie am I ok
And so it begins. First movie of the holiday season, The Muppets Christmas Carol. Favorite Scrooge of all time @themichaelcaine
This is my favorite version of this movie. I watch this every year. — watching A Christmas Carol (1951)
@VeryRichDILF there's a lesbian movie set in the 50s called Carol that's coming out soon
@I_Fell_In_Dior @drewwyatt Kindess makes them uncomfortable! I think a Christmas Carol movie would suit them! Maybe I could haunt them all!
#Carol was fantastic. What a movie. And Cate... she's a goddess.

The movie 'Carol' reaffirms that Cate Blanchett is one of the most stunningly gorgeous beings ever. Notice how I didn't say human...
"I spent much of Carol asking, 'Why would anyone leave Kyle Chandler?'" Congrats @THR, you've won for dumbest possible lesbian movie review.
"I know this is a movie about a f/f relationship but, UM, what about the men??" Literally all 5 of Carol's negative reviews.
@FilmFatale_NYC I hope she and Kamala are in @captainmarvel. Carol can't be the only woman in the movie.

But dear Civil War if you fucking kill Rhodey before I get a Carol/Rhodey movie I am DONE WITH YOU
I kind of wish Carol were going to be in this movie instead of Spider-Man? I think the movie way needs another female hero.
When they announced civil war, it was in the same timeframe they were working on peter parker's mcu deal & announcing carol danver's movie
as the lights went down before Carol the couple next to me said "omg our first movie!" and honestly I thought about that for the whole film
remember how they pushed back carol's movie to give me yet another spider-man origin film. the north remembers.

@TheDarkNolan I'm watching an classic Christmas movie with Michael Caine a Muppet Christmas Carol
I have also never been SO drawn to Cate Blanchett. Pure elegance and glamour in this movie. You get pulled to her, like Therese. #Carol
#Carol is a fantastic study of human attraction/magnetism. And yet ironically, it is also a completely unsentimental movie (in a good way).
#Carol is a quiet, beautiful movie. Director Todd Haynes actually showed up to introduce the movie at the beginning of my showtime (!).

I'm watching Muppet Christmas Carol. One of my favorites, I love the message of this movie. Funny and sweet!
CAROL was a stunning movie. But the best part was the nearly full theater to see a story about two women in love.

Why am I awake?! And more importantly y am I watching A Muppet Christmas Carol movie and liking it?!?
my book that the movie carol is based off came in the mail friday and i get to pick it up monday im so excited
Carol would be a great movie if it wasn't so much like watching a wolf take down a deer.
I might call amc one day this week because they had a Carol movie poster so like what's the deal are they gonna show it or nah.
Go see the movie "Carol"! I am blown away...STUNNING...sexy...deftly moving on so many levels...love wins! #CarolMovie
Arclight. CAROL. Need to take my mind off the cat...probably shouldn't have chosen a movie starring her namesake...
A Muppets Christmas Carol has always been a highly underrated movie.
The muppet Christmas carol is always a great movie to kickoff the holiday season
Still laughing like a little kid at this movie  — watching A Muppets Christmas carol
Watching The Muppet Christmas Carol! Best Christmas movie EVER!!!
The fact that I cant go out to the movies tomorrow & he says"we can watch a movie at your house, ill bring pizza"
. @realDonaldTrump dude, have you seen this Christmas Carol movie?
Bella swear she all into this A Muppets Christmas Carol movie ... #BellaDonnaBoudreauxRemyLeBeau https://instagram.com/p/-X179svXkb/ 
Carol :drops popcorn in the hall way before the movie Me:wants popcorn and there's none left Carol: there's some in the hallway
This review is correct. "Carol" is a gorgeous movie. http://www.vox.com/culture/2015/11/20/9769890/carol-movie-review …
a muppet christmas carol is a top 50 movie of all time and i am thrilled it's already playing on tv
#TurkeyHollow was a great movie and now the muppets Christmas carol is on #TheMuppets
When the Muppets Christmas Carol is on and you love that movie but like it's just too soon....
apparently there's a gay movie out and it's really good (I think it's called carol) can anyone tell me about it?
Is going to see Carol tomorrow Gram: what movie are you seeing? Me: certainly not a movie about lesbians I assure you
A Muppets Christmas Carol is hands down my favorite Christmas movie. All operations halt when it comes on tv.
I really hope after her movie happens we get to bring back Feminist Zine Editor Carol and she can, like, start a magazine with Jessica Jones
Oh @CarolMovie , you cut me to the quick. Gut wrenching movie with the best score I heard in years. Care Blanchett is flawless. #Carol

What I loved the most about Carol was the message of the movie: The heart wants what it wants, society and propriety be damned.

In 1952, a film treatment of "The Price of Salt" was written: a road movie called "Winter Journey", changing Carol to a man named Carl.
I did not fall desperately in love with the movie Carol, BUT I am definitely on an island alone. Everyone should see it! (When you can.)
Well, Carol was the best movie about queer women ever made. Holy god, Cate Blanchett.
. @mindylou213 Whatever was on Lifetime! The cheesy ones went off. Now watching a much more serious movie- the muppets christmas carol.
Got a Christmas tree today when I got home a Muppets Christmas Carol was playing which is our family's traditional tree setup movie we watch
So happy Disney's A Christmas Carol is on Netflix, most favourite movie ever
Watching with the Babbiestewie Muppets Christmas Carol on lifetime love this movie so much #Wonderfulwaytostarttheholidays
Holiday movie binge begins now! Starting with Muppets Christmas Carol. #holidaymovies #favoritetimeofyear @Scott_R_Roberts
if the cate blanchett lesbian movie "CAROL" ends with a suicide, i quit hollywood
the muppet Christmas carol will forever stay the best movie
So excited, my favorite Muppet Movie is on. "A Muppet Christmas Carol".
@audreyhacker werent they planning on having carol in the show but then they changed it bc movie
CAROL is a good movie.
The beautiful and thrilling 'Carol' belongs among the best movie love stories http://fb.me/7Makl6GO9 
Watching The Muppet Christmas Carol and I have come to the conclusion that every holiday needs a Muppet movie especially Halloween.
@trixies_star If you get the chance to see CAROL you have to go because I literally have never seen a movie more relevant to your interests!
Trees up and it looks beautiful! Time to kick back with a takeaway and movie — watching Disney's A Christmas Carol
I cannot wait to see this movie. #Carol http://themuse.jezebel.com/todd-hayness-carol-like-the-romance-at-its-center-is-1743645040?utm_campaign=socialflow_jezebel_facebook&utm_source=jezebel_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow …

Based on all the sexual orientation questions asked by press people at the CAROL press conference, my takeaway is: WE NEED THIS MOVIE BADLY!
I haven't been to the cinema in like 10 years. I also forgot that the last THG movie is coming out soon. Before Carol.

Simply put, Carol is the movie we've been waiting for.
