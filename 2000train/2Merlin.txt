@eleven8 holy crap. Merlin was the usher at the movie theatre.

Any movie about Merlin that pronounces 'Morgana' wrong cannot be watched. Needless to say it's American not British.

This season of #OUAT is continuing to show my nerdy side because I definitely watched a little too much of the Merlin movie growing up
@itselliotknight I read you were a fan of the 1998 Merlin movie with @TwoPaddocks What did you like best about it :D I loved the whole thing
@SerafiniTV So, if Violet is not Madam Mim then she can be Nimue. In the movie Merlin said that he knew Mim for years. Maybe that´s how. ;)

I'm so happy we got that little scene between Merlin and Emma flashing back to the moment at the movie theater from when Emma was a kid
@itselliotknight HI!!!! Did you ever watch the 1998 movie "Merlin" with Sam Neil and Miranda Richardson???
so...Merlin was an usher at a theater which was playing a movie about Merlin. Huh? #OUAT #OnceUponATime
#OnceUponATime fun fact: Merlin was the door man in the movie theater when she stole the chocolate bar as a kid.
Merlin: I know you from the movie theater, I caught ur ass stealing Emma: ........gtg
that guy at the movie was Merlin I'm he last one to realize it
Wait...If Merlin was stuck in a tree for hundreds of years...how was he also in the movie theater with young Emma?????? #OnceUponATime #OUAT
@merIIins i really need like a merlin movie or special that finally gives us the merthur kiss we deserve
Also, someone should make a Merlin movie
this is just brill omg fckng fantastic whew. A+ movie love love love Merlin
@doctor_ohmy I blame the old TV Merlin movie really.
i never stop hoping for Merlin series 6 although i dont mind if they make a movie (takes place in modern world of course)
Harry Potter is the best fantasy movie series and Merlin is the best fantasy tv series EVER. These two are masterpieces. End of story !

@red_mercer I feel like Merlin's Shop wanted to be a comedy. Though that might be an overly generous reading of that movie.
Army of Darkness is on Starz at 9:55C. If you like a cross b/w dark comedy/horror and Arthur/Merlin, this is your movie.
Watching #Kingsman again and editing. Man(ners maketh man) I love that movie. Roxy, Eggsy, Galahad, Lancelot and Merlin.

Oh Snap it was Merlin who warned Young Emma in the Movie theater not to touch the sword in the stone #OUAT
@OnceABC It is time they explain the movie scene as Merlin was trapped as a tree during the curse
@OnceABC MERLIN IS THE GUY WHO TOLD EMMA NOT TO PULL EXCALLIBUR OUT OF THE STONE AT THE MOVIE THEATER
So are they going to explain how Maple Merlin managed to talk to Emma back in the day in the movie theater? #OnceUponATime
MERLIN IS THE DUDE FROM THE MOVIE THEATER THAT TOLD EMMA SWAN NOT TO TAKE THE DAGGER EXCALIBUR!
Ok, A) who expected Merlin to be a hottie; and B) wasn't he the guy who gave Emma the warning in the movie theater? #OUAT
It's Merlin! #OUAT Emma: no, wait, guys, this dude's just an usher from a movie theater.
HOLY FUCK MERLIN WAS THE MOVIE THEATER DUDE SHE MET WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE I'M SCRAMAINF #OnceUponATime
#ouat Merlin is the movie theatre guy
psyche. Merlin is the creepy movie theater guy, Emma! #OnceUponATime
MERLIN WAS THE MOVIE THEATER GUY RIGHT?? HOLY POO #OUAT
Merlin is the guy from the movie theater Emma went to as a kid! #OUAT
Just now realizing that Merlin was at the movie theatre. He fine by the way #OnceUponATime
Why do we have to make every character YOUNG? I wanted to see Merlin as an older man with a long beard like in the movie. #OnceUponATime
OH SHIT THAT WAS MERLIN IN THE MOVIE THEATER
WELCOME BACK MERLIN AKA THE MOVIE THEATER USHER
Most intriguing beginning to #OnceUponATime. The man who spoke to Emma in the movie theater. Not sure he is Merlin.
So it was Merlin who appeared to 'little girl' Emma in the movie theater #OUAT http://bea.md/1WcRVSQ 
So Merlin was the movie theatre guy? Just coming and going from his tree and between realms as he pleases? #queerytales
You remember that usher that approached young Emma in the movie theater...? WAS THAT MERLIN?! #OUaT

Watch the movie Merlin, the final scene he's walking away & the goddess screams, powerless because he refuses to give her attention = power
bookstores don't often have a screenplay section, but when they do, the one script they always have is Merlin, the made for tv movie, wtf?

I am going to cry Merlin was perfect movie ever @MerlinOfficial
"What..You're slowing down!" "I'm bringing him in closer Merlin." "You're going to do WHAT?!?!?" Still one of the best movie convos ever
So Colin Morgan is in a movie called Waiting For You, does this mean Merlin is staring at Avalon the whole movie?

@Krupp6Kyle kingsman is a movie, Merlin is the character
#whatihateinghana is the Kumawood movies trying to act every movie like SpiderMan, Fast&Furios, Merlin, Hercules etc
Not to mention McGrath was in that movie and she plays Morgana in Merlin so after binge watching that and seeing her face I got more
so basically the only highlights of that movie were christ pratt, dinosaurs, and morgana from merlin
idris elba knows josh from the first thor movie they should really catch up talk about ouat say he'd be perfect for merlin
@robgreeneII @merlinc2 Thanks, had no idea. Merlin, is that when Adolph was in Atlanta, or earlier? I’d pay to see them in an action movie.
Most of y'all still think movie series are still in the age of Merlin & Legend of the Seeker

What's Morgana from Merlin doing in the Dino movie
i saw that katie mcgrath was gonna be in knights of the round table movie & i was bucked because i was like the merlin movie but no #played
@whitenosugartv Thanks for sharing.That's already powerful!Can't wait for the whole movie! #ColinMorgan is an outstanding actor @theCALMzone
@patrickmcurry I remember loving it as a kid and took weeks to get a Netflix DVD of it, and yeah. What was the point of that movie. Merlin?
Merlin's beard Harry's voice was high in the second movie. He's such an adorable snake speaking baby.
I wish they'd do a #Merlin movie to give it a more suitable ending. It was such a good show...until the ending, which almost every fan hates
off to Buy Merlin s1 again..... I must re-watch that movie.... #Merlin
The Sword in the Stone is such an underrated Disney movie. Merlin da OG
I had a stupid moment though, I was already watching more than half of the movie but didnt realize Merlin was Mark Strong.
i also want a good merlin movie
I don't wanna spoil thr movie It's so gud Also merlin is the best I love merlin Merlin is just M e r l i n
@exwires Kafka on the shore, fave movie is between girl interrupted and howl's moving castle, and favorite tv show is Merlin
I am so glad Merlin didn't turn out to be corrupted. Can't believe I waited so long to see it so thanks to Jehan for the movie night!
Son and @LeifB73 are watching a movie called The Last Legion apparently I've just spoiled it by saying Ben Kingsley is Merlin
@NewLife11986 @Parked_movie @darraghbyrne1 @HayKells This scene was so heartbreaking! Powerful acting by #ColinMorgan! #Cathal #Parked
This movie looks promising! Plus, it's Katie Grath a.k.a Morgana Pendragon (Merlin)!!! http://youtu.be/z736c3pXb7w 
Some1 shuld cc the producers of merlin, pls it is not too late to continue the movie and end it well
Lmao! RT @Mz_Phloxie: Another movie that ended stupidly was merlin, morgana still lived, Arthur (cont) http://tl.gd/nk58bq 
Another movie that ended stupidly was merlin, morgana still lived, Arthur died, the stupid prophesy never came to pass! It was all 4 nothing
@byunnstar im gonna watch the shrek movie with arthur and merlin to fill the hole in my heart
Any sci-fi, magic, superpowers(and the likes) movie is trash to me. What's my own with dumbledore and Merlin?

#JurassicWorldSpoilers Any #Merlin fans? Morgana is in the movie.
4) Morgana from BBC'S Merlin is in this movie! And has the longest, most drawn out, most RIDICULOUS death of the franchise.
I didn't know Katie McGrath was in #JurassicWorld ...good movie #merlin
Dear Merlin, I've been on movie theater for #Tomorrowland for fifteen minutes and they are still showing trailers.
Katie McGrath aka Morgana from Merlin was in Jurassic World so regardless of how good the movie was I give 10/10.

When Legend of the Seeker and Merlin have better race & gender diversity in casting than mega-budgeted movie franchises, something is wrong.
@NI_ColinMorgan Cathal first, Parked is a very beautiful movie. And Merlin of course, for the wide diversity of emotions played by Colin.
