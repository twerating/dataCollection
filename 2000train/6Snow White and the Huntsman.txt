@ClarkHat I don't remember Snow White and the Huntsman being bad. But then, I drank so much gin during the movie I don't remember any of it.
Mrs. Clark asked me if I'd take her to Star Wars. I am now officially nervous. Last movie she wanted to see was Snow White and the Huntsman

@jeneps J, I was wondering if Hillary was going to come out dressed as Snow White. I haven't seen the movie, Snow White and The Huntsman.
Chris Hemsworth is a freaking BABE in the movie Snow White and the Huntsman. Need a man, want a man just like that. Dear lord

Remember that god awful Snow White and the Huntsman movie? Well it's making a sequel... Or a prequel? With the Ice Queen. What?
This Snow white and the Huntsman movie is trying its best to convince us Kristen Stewart is a swag.
Seems like an epic movie, i must watch! " @Sthem056: Snow White and the Huntsman -"

Ow Finnick in Snow White and the Huntsman movie.
Omggggg they made a huntsman movie!!! (Part 2 to snow white and the huntsman)
So pissed that Kristen Stewart is not the In the Snow White and the huntsman movie . That shit would be nothing without her
????? okay but for real how is the snow white and the huntsman movie of all fucking movies getting a sequel
Please educate me on The Huntsman. Is it related to that Snow White and the Huntsman movie I never saw? What's the 411?
A "Snow White and the Huntsman" movie without Kristen Stewart? That's all I ever wanted.
Snow white and the huntsman was so good. The whole movie I expected Chris to whip out mjolnir and like shout "this is madness, for Asgard !"
Is The Huntsman movie a prequel to Snow White and the huntsman?
okkkkk whats the point in making another snow white and the huntsman movie if it doesnt have kristen stewart OR sam caflin
Wait so is the new huntsman movie in anyway related to Snow White and the huntsman
I won't pretend I liked Snow White and the Huntsman but I also won't pretend that I won't see a movie with Theron, Blunt, and Chastain.
literally only saw that Snow White and the Huntsman movie for Queen Charlize. African Empress.
lol they made another snow white and the huntsman movie (without snow white) lol glad reveena is back Charlize was great
Omg the second part of snow white and the huntsman will b out soon i thought the whole movie was cancelled
No Stewart, no movie.. Snow White and the Huntsman per me non ha un seguito.
(But The Huntsman's trailer doesn't seem to understand that Snow White and The Huntsman was the Queen's movie.)
@TheHuntsman ooooh. So if im not mistaken, this movie is a prequel to the snow white and the huntsman. No more kristen stewart
Snow White and the Huntsman may have been a strange movie but holy crap the score is gorgeous.
Yay and it's the same actors from the snow white and the Huntsman movie http://fb.me/2sGl3rvWN 
idek why im so hyped abt this movie, the snow white and the huntsman bored me to tears the only redeeming factor was chris wielding an axe
So they're making a sequel to "Snow White and the Huntsman". I honestly forgot that was even a movie, and I think everyone else did too

I had no idea they were making a Snow White and the Huntsman spin off movie
Snow White and the Huntsman was not a good enough movie to make into a sequel, especially after what Kristen Stewart did.
I know nothing about the next Snow White and The Huntsman movie (I guess it's just the Huntsman now ugh gross why) but-
Why is Snow White and the Huntsman getting another movie!?
There's no need for Snow White and the huntsman to have a spin off movie. But il be watching it.
I've never fallen asleep in a movie theater, but Snow White and the Huntsman was one of two close calls. Of course there's a sequel.
im confused as to why snow white and the huntsman got another movie but i won't complain because hemsworth and theron
Are they making a sequel to "Snow white and the huntsman"? But that movie was so terrible!!!
Snow White and the Huntsman is a terrible movie like it's shocking how bad it is.

Kristen was not good in Snow White and the Huntsman. That movie would have been ten times better without her in it. #Truth

@Shiek927 Same thing with Snow White and the Huntsman. You just wait until the new Cinderella movie comes out.
Kristen Stewart is a horrible actor and ruined Snow White and the Huntsman and every other movie she has been in.
Snow White and the Huntsman is better as a book and that's really funny since the book is literally based off of the movie. #what?
snow white and the huntsman is just a really pretty movie wow.
Snow White and the Huntsman is actually a really dark movie
what if this Self/Less trailer is lying to me? what if it's like Snow White and the Huntsman and Matthew is barely in the movie.
I have some real fundamental issues with Snow White and The Huntsman movie. That’s all I’m saying.
Snow White and the Huntsman I love this movie!!! Who will ride with me !! Who will be my brother
Snow White and the Huntsman, not great movie - unbelievable that the mirror would think Stewart is fairer than Theron. Downhill from there

For someone who hated men, the queen from "Snow White and the Huntsman" sure spent most of the movie hurting women.
Snow White and the huntsman is still the best Snow White movie tho.
I couldn't even watch Snow White and the Huntsman and Maleficent was a terrible movie so I don't hold out much hope for Cinderella.
HAVE I EVER EXPRESSED how very much i enjoy the movie snow white and the huntsman
Come back from class and Snow White and the huntsman is on, I've decided there are too many midgets in this movie. I'm rather uncomfortable
So I'm watching this Snow White and the Huntsman movie and tbh Chris Hemsworth would of made a better Snow White than Kristen Stewart
It's good though. “ @ChloeReliford: Snow White and the Huntsman a looooong asssss movie! ”

Apocalypse Now and Conan the Barbarian are the same movie. Moonrise Kingdome and Snow White and the Huntsman are also the same movie.
I hope that the new #BeautyandtheBeast movie does what Snow White and the Huntsman did for Snow White. Something dark and edgy. @Disney

Snow White and The Huntsman movie review @GraceRandolph http://youtu.be/ly-LxbiTi24 
Like Snow White and the Huntsman. Awfully written and acted movie, but the music/visuals were so impressively strong. Powerful use of tone.
also im ngl the fact ppl who created snow white and the huntsman are doing this movie is not a good sign that movie was so bad
Easily the worst movie I've seen in my life was Snow white and the Huntsman
"However the prospect of a GitS movie directed by the guy who did 'Snow White and the Huntsman' gives me Dragonball Evolution ptsd." THIS
SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN is a boring action movie and GHOST IN THE SHELL will probably be boring, too, with Sanders directing.
(The Ghost in the Shell movie will also be THE WORST because it's directed by Rupert Sanders of the scatorific Snow White and the Huntsman.)

Snow white and the huntsman movie is really strange. The graphic is awesome but the story is changed too much for it to be normal.
//I watched Snow White and the Huntsman today. Im not a big Kristen Stewart fan but I enjoyed her in this movie kinda.

Katy perry looks like she off the movie snow white and the huntsman
it's the same with the trailers for Snow White and the Huntsman, Charlize was in those trailers 90% but only in the movie for 40%.
So Angelina Jolie saw how much fun Charlize Theron had with Snow White and the Huntsman, and asked for a scenery-chewing movie of her own?
Movie reminds me of Snow White and the Huntsman
Is it weird if Katy Perry's Grammys performance reminds me of that Kristen Stewart movie, Snow White and the Huntsman?
