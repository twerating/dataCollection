True Detective's 2nd season is like The Last Airbender movie: it doesn't exist #lakelaogai
"The Last Airbender" movie received 5 Razzie awards including: Worst Picture, Worst Director, and "Worst Eye-Gouging Mis-Use of 3D".
So can they redo the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie into 3 parts? I would greatly appreciate it .
Which movie do you think is overrated? — Avatar: the last airbender http://l.ask.fm/igoto/45DKECN75V62DDAUPY6IQO6K5WADHLAKR3Z73G55DW57BPN2ZEY5KMYNGBFMWRZUK2Z76FAIIJWDYXQVYYU5Y25CPT22BFDJUUBBZFKJA5YHAM7EA6RDOKHGTCZPBBTFT2VYKEQ2T7GGNGN2J2LAMXDC7HFHNLE4Z7FU32TWWKW2MYHSIUYFB5HK5NNIJ4H3TI43KFDU4EKQ==== …
@mileslarson7 if we're being completely honest, I don't think either of them could compete w/ the Avatar the Last Airbender movie
I'm watching a movie called 'The Last Airbender' and giggling away whenever anyone declares 'He/She is a bender'. Which they do a lot.
@AlaeMaGalue there's only so much you can do with a real movie of a cartoon especially like the last airbender.
Steven Spielberg please do a remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender movie pls make it cool pls pls pls. All books pls.
The Last Airbender wasn't that bad a movie. A little boring, but not terrible. Geeks need to lighten up. When's the sequel?
Avatar The Last Airbender was a great show, the movie was trash.
@jokerking15 The Inhumans movie: Objectively speaking, a better Avatar movie than the Last Airbender.
No other movie in existance has ever done this to me. Not even the abomination that was The Last Airbender movie.
Smart Movie Fan 29 is here! THE LAST AIRBENDER! TERRIBLE FILM? WHAT A TWIST! Get it on Smart Wrestling Fan EXTRA at http://www.smartwrestlingfan.com 
I'm still mad at Avatar for stealing The Last Airbender's title. Oh and for being a boring movie.
Remember when we were all super hyped up for avatar: the last airbender movie to come out and then it was the biggest disappointment.
Watching "Avatar The Last Airbender" (movie) like pic.twitter.com/xlcwWZjVWd
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/pLdapC7QtiI?a  The Last Airbender in hindi 2010 hd 720p part 1 full movie
The worst part about Avatar the Last Airbender isn't the horrible movie attempt but the people who wanted Katara to be with Zuko.
I think I just found the equivalent of the last airbender movie in anime
the last airbender movie is on my tv & i can't find the remote this is how it ends
Attempting to watch The Last Airbender movie. Prepare my funeral.
@_Griffinnn @TheRainbowElm0 Let's do the Last Airbender movie
@AlexAllTimeLow Have you watched avatar the last airbender? The series, not the terrible movie
"The Last Airbender" (2010) is a dissatisfying movie (F) #AhiMovieReviews <nz6tqt>
The last Airbender avatar a hard ahh movie
I've never seen the Last Airbender movie but apparently it's the worst movie in the universe, which kind of makes me wanna watch it lol

yo i never watched the film but why tf did they cast some blonde white girl to play katara in The Last Airbender movie? Were they blind?
when I first watched avatar I thought it was a non animated movie of avatar the last airbender and was outraged that it wasn't
The ratings for The Last Airbender movie are probably now higher than my GPA
@killthenoise and the Avatar The Last Airbender movie. They all gotta just... vanish.
Related: I went to the Last Airbender movie premier
@Darrangedd I did something similar by pretending Avatar: The Last Airbender was a cartoon based on the movie.

The little man discovered The Last Airbender, the cartoon not the movie. Can't wait to watch with him.
Avatar The Last Airbender has had more of a cultural impact than Avatar the highest grossing bloody movie of all times.
Imagine a live action Naruto movie. . . . . . . . . . . . Now imagine the director is the same one as the last airbender movie
The riff is entertaining, but the movie...wow. At least Food Fight and The Last Airbender had SOME coherancy.
@netflix when are you going to put avatar the last airbender back on Netflix? The tv series not the shitty movie
@SuperBroMovies @CaptainGalxy Which Avatar movie is that... It better not freaking be the Last Airbender...

Okay but you can't make me feel sympathetic toward the Avater: The Last Airbender movie. Now that was actual trash
Avatar the last airbender is the shit . But of course when they made the movie they fucked it all up. And legend of Kora was trash
The Last Airbender live action movie is $O SHITTY
It's been two years and still when I think of the Last Airbender movie I get angry.
i decided to watch the last airbender movie and vomited twice just during the title screen

the Avatar The Last Airbender movie has been the biggest disappointment of my entire life, honestly
The answer was The Last Airbender. Ari said M Night Shyamalan movie bad reviews. She answered Karate Kid.
Am I the only one who thinks of the last airbender series instead of the movie with those blue creatures when someone says Avatar??

@mclifford82 @SpencerJGilbert Won round 1 "What movie should be remade from last 15 years?" with Avatar: The Last Airbender
@SpencerJGilbert Perfect pick! The Last Airbender needs a better movie! #moviefightslive
I would like to see a reboot of The Last Airbender. @SpencerJGilbert read my mind. The movie could've been a new LOTR #moviefightslive
The Last Airbender just doesn't need a live action movie... Maybe a short #moviefightslive
@ABluSkittle It almost reminds me of the movie 'Avatar'. Beautifully made, Skit! ( No, not Avatar the last Airbender, that 1 quite sucks.)

#IWishICouldForget The Last Airbender movie smh wtf was that shit???
Do yourself a favor and never watch the last airbender movie.
the last airbender movie was the worst thing in the world
The casting call for the last airbender specifically looked for Caucasians to take the role of Asian In the movie awhile ago
@miranda4502 @realhartman Uh Oh! Please don't let M. Night Shamlan direct this movie. We can't stand how bad The Last Airbender movie was
mom just told me, unironically, "I enjoyed the last airbender movie!" /stares at the camera
i need there to be a second avatar the last airbender movie so my childhood can be fulfilled please
@Fishy_Cakess I pray for you, that the movie doesn't turn out to be like The Last Airbender
"The Last Airbender" movie received 5 Razzie awards including: Worst Picture, Worst Director, and "Worst Eye-Gouging Mis-Use of 3D"
That's why his Avatar: The Last Airbender movie failed. Bad things happen to bad people. https://twitter.com/ign/status/638539123238772737 …
That moment you noticed Ron Pearlman's voice in Avatar: The Last Airbender (Not the shitty movie)
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/6jvpOpDraZU?a  Nostalgia Critic: The Last Airbender Movie Review
@haraleili this is gonna piss me off like the Avatar (The Last Airbender) movie did .
Just saw Avatar: The Last Airbender. How come no one told me how good that movie is?!?!
After 5 years, a fan of The Last Airbender movie looks back and notes the 5 things done wrong and 5 things done right http://last-airbender-movie.deviantart.com/journal/Top-5-Things-TLA-got-Wrong-and-Right-556142894 …
OMG, Travis aka Cliff Curtis was Fire Lord Ozai in the Shayamalamadingdong's The Last Airbender movie. No wonder he looked familiar.
The last airbender movie was hillarious too... especially the earthbenders. They could as well just throw stones. Nothing unique from us
Avatar The Last Airbender was my show and when the movie came out I was excited, but it sucked so i was upset
everytime i see the last airbender movie in netflix i cry for 40 years
it pisses me off how much the last airbender movie sucked
So the general consensus is that the attack on titan movie is going the way of the last airbender in that we're pretending it never happened
Tbh I quite liked the live action movie. At least it wasn't as bad as ohshc or the last airbender
i can't even think about the last airbender movie without cringing
@Marisa_Hopkins @toplofty_biped It's so good. But you should watch Avatar The Last Airbender first! (The show not the movie.)
I don't know why people are clamoring over The Last Airbender 2. Don't support the movie by not watching it.
Who else has seen the last airbender series not the movie
Still better than The Last Airbender movie pic.twitter.com/eZcuuorFrv
[ Movies ] Open Question : There making a sequel to the Last Airbender (first avatar movie) what do you think ... http://yhoo.it/1KkUdip 
apparently M. Night Shyamalan is making a sequel to avatar the last airbender movie he made in 2010. ha. ha. ha........ please dont
@weeabob @joeisaloser the last airbender or the pls stop racism against blue people movie?
@_kenziewilson TV Show: Avatar: The Last Airbender. Movie: Finding Nemo
OH MY GOSH. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER 2 AS A SERIES BUT ITS ACTUALLY THE CRAPPY MOVIE
Suppose The Last Airbender movie was loosely based off the original Star Wars trilogy, but made into a CGI TV show. That's Star Wars: Rebels
I actually forgot the Last Airbender movie even existed so I'm assuming it was so terrible that i had to delete my own memory of seeing it.
Sneak peak of the new Avatar the Last Airbender movie. #3kCountdown pic.twitter.com/qEdzDeW5HJ
You know that Avatar: The Last Airbender movie that everyone thought was terrible? Its getting a sequel for some reason.
On behalf of my race, I apologize for the Last Airbender Movie
Tell me how my sister is watching a Ghanaian movie and the music playing in the background is the last airbender theme song
Please tell me that all these stories of an Avatar the Last Airbender movie sequel are all fake. Plz.
Still very disappointed in The Last Airbender live action movie, and it has literally been years
They're making a second movie for Avatar: the last Airbender and it distresses me to a whole other level pic.twitter.com/SBkJAgUMA1
Yeep. The trailer for Pan gives me the "Avatar The Last Airbender The Movie" kind of a feel. Maybe it's just all the whitewashing.
Episode of Avatar, The Last Airbender in 1st period and The Lego Movie in 2nd? I love Fridays.
Avatar: The last airbender the movie sucked so hard that @IceBearIsBae might be straight from now on
Dude said "The Last Airbender movie wasn't bad." pic.twitter.com/3WrpH7CHae
The live action Attack on Titan is just as bad as the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie... to the surprise of absolutely nobody.
If I could have one movie wish it would be for a badass director/writer to redo Avatar The Last Airbender
Clicked the last airbender movie instead of show.... WHY ARE THEY ALL WHITE ???
@Dinglazaar that was more disappointing than the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie
The Last Airbender movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan. #ThingsBetterThanNikkisReign
Any live action movie adaptation of an anime is trash. Period. Dragon Ball Evolution, The Last Airbender, and Attack on Titan were all poo
@SpiritualKorra I don't recognize that movie title. I mean, there was something similar called "Horse Shit: The Last Airbender"
@Graycious_Bear the thing about the movie is that if you saw like anything else pertaining to the last airbender you were disappointed
so if this whole thing turns out to be fake im going to fukcing ham someone for making me get all angry about the last airbender movie AGAIN
like at least with cars 3 i understand that it's a dumb kids movie thats gonna make money. LITERALLY NOBODY LIKED THE LAST AIRBENDER
ALRIGHT there's gonna be a second The Last Airbender movie.....
KHSDJFNM,BDMHDBABkmsdMNDFS i hope this isn't going to be like. the last airbender movie 2.0
so basically if M nights new movie the visit does well in the box office he'll make the last airbender 2 pic.twitter.com/jGMcFT0FAl
Ill pretend Kendrick never even collab'd, like The Last Airbender never had a movie
If you think "The Last Airbender" movie is anything besides actual garbage that should be burned, fight me.
Wow... They're trying to make an avatar the last airbender movie sequel. @MNightShyamalan just stop man the last one was horrible
Shyamalan said he is ready to make a sequel to his Avatar: The Last Airbender movie. I don't want him shitting on my childhood anymore.
THE LAST AIRBENDER MOVIE IS ON TV PARKOURS TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL
Remember how shitty The Last Airbender movie was. didn't even pronounce his name right.
@ZombieKingNY isn't he the fucker who made the last airbender movie
Apparently they're going to make Avatar: the Last Airbender 2? How can they make a sequel without a first movie?
" @okayeserrano: Uhm so there's going to be a sequel for Avatar: The Last Airbender. Yes. The movie." kill it before it lays eggs D:
They're making another Avatar: the Last Airbender. I loved the series, but refuse to watch the movie b/c of all of the white-washing.
Now watching the live action Attack on Titan movie. Hopefully it wont be dissapointing as the movie Avatar: The Last Airbender
There's going to be a sequel to the last airbender movie????????????? look here! #STOP
the last airbender movie was so bad but they should really try again before I die
I may be weird for this... But avatar the last airbender was my ishhh in the day ... Except the movie version... That was shit
If the rumor about The Last Airbender movie getting a sequel is true, then fuck, there's no justice in this world anymore.
So a sequel to the last Airbender movie was just confirmed...I'm not sure how to feel about it
ok guys. watching the last airbender movie cuz ive never seen the entire thing. only made it 17 minutes through last time before giving up
Sometimes I'll randomly remember that The Last Airbender movie exists and get filled with rage.
What's the worst movie ever? — The last airbender smh u don't even have to ask that it's obvious http://ask.fm/a/ce76abk5 
please tell me that article about the last airbender movie finally getting a sequel is fake........
If they make another live action avatar the last airbender movie imma have break a director

If the worst movie I've ever seen "The Last Airbender" can get Sequel..you can literally get a second chance at anything.
"Windows 8 wasn't bad enough, let's make Windows 10 worse." "Avatar: The Last Airbender movie wasn't bad enough. Let's make a sequel."
Same with The Last Airbender. That movie could be PHENOMENAL if they tried
I think I'm genuinely one of the only people excited for 'The Last Airbender' to have a 2nd movie coming out!!!! @MNightShyamalan
Is actually the last airbender movie 2 going to happen??? I mean couldn't he just let the Chinese do it or something
They're making another Avatar the Last Airbender movie... Why...
The Last Airbender is getting a sequel movie but still no OHSHC season 2
This is what keeps happening when I try to tweet my anger towards a second Avatar the last airbender movie pic.twitter.com/qxcEVFTmKh
WHY IS THERE GOING TO BE THE LAST AIRBENDER 2 MOVIE
NOOOOOOOO! A sequel to the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie has been announced... I like M. Knight. But his... http://fb.me/7wbiHL3mB 
Damn you M. Night Shamamalama why do u have to tortureus by making a second The last Airbender movie???
Avatar the Last Airbender was the worst movie..why were the characters white? Did Dev Patel make up for this tragic movie? Avatar was a PoC-
5 years later and M. Night still can't accept that avatar: the last airbender live action movie was horrible.
I cannot explain how legitimately offended I am by The Last Airbender movie
The whole atla fandom will never get over the last airbender movie...
Nerdy movie night: first, Dragonball: Evolution then The Last Airbender then either Green Lantern or 2003's Hulk
Wow M. Night Shyamalan's new movie looks way better than the Last Airbender live action crap he made.
for the love of god do not make another avatar the last airbender movie
Please, for the love of god, do not make another Avatar: the Last Airbender movie. The first one was awful enough. @MNightShyamalan
why is m night shyamalan making the last airbender 2 did he not remember that the first one was the worst movie of the year
@NotRobG you guys are think of Avatar, I meant "avatar: the last airbender" movie
Oh, cool. The Last Airbender movie is getting a sequel. It'll be fun to watch everyone make fun of it for another 5 years.
it's funny how bad the last airbender movie was but how great the music was
When i saw the Last Airbender movie i though that i would never see something that horrible again. Now the sequel had been confirmed. Bleh
I was worried about the new The Legend Of Zorro movie being in a Post-Apocalyptic World, but now that Avatar: The Last Airbender 2 has been-
Please don't make another "Avatar: The Last Airbender" movie. Please.
I would be okay with gluing beehives to my face forever if it meant society would forget that The Last Airbender movie exists
The Last Airbender I love this movie and the series too♡amazing pic.twitter.com/N0wqdFGQfI
The last airbender movie is a threat to humanity
Why are they making a second Avatar the Last Airbender movie?!? - Stop the madness….. Please just stop! http://tmblr.co/Z8hCwn1slIln7 
I just wanna know WHY there's gonna be an avatar: the last airbender 2 movie??? the first one was an abomination
Avatar the Last Airbender 2 is confirmed. Crossing my fingers for a ten fold improvement from the first movie. http://www.vcpost.com/articles/86253/20150823/avatar-last-airbender-2-updates-director-m-night-shyamalan-defends-first-film-ready-sequel.htm …
I hate how M.Night Shymalan defended his The Last Airbender movie for sucking because "It's made for kids." That's just lazy writing.
The Last Airbender movie is gonna have a second movie sequel... REST IN FUCKING PEACE.
The dude Travis in #FearTheWalkingDead was Fire Lord Ozai in the god awful The Last Airbender movie.
They're making a 'the last airbender 2' movie NOOOOOOOOOO they ruined everything with the first movie STOP
Brah did this guy play Ozai in the Last Airbender movie or am I trippin? #FearTheWalkingDead
watching the movie version of avatar the last airbender was easily one of the most disappointing moments in my life
I just saw a comment on youtube that said "I really enjoyed the Avatar the Last Airbender movie." this can't be real
the last airbender full movie online http://taptv.net/the-last-airbender-full-movie-online/ …

@random30404904 @brooklynpsn @HarrisHarrisev9 sadly the AOT movie was like the last airbender terrible level.
They need to make the movie for book 2 of The Last Airbender but this time, not crappy and disappointing and a waste of time.
This movie is already better than The Last Airbender pic.twitter.com/hUo7jL3mB6
We hope you enjoy your in-flight movie: "The Last Airbender" by M. Night Shyamalan #BadInFlightAnnouncements @midnight

People are complaining about the Attack on Titan movie like Avatar:The Last Airbender didn't happen. Just allow.
@AliFaroukAhmed that was me after the last airbender (the series, not the movie lmao)

I'm still mad they fucked up the real life Dragonball Z movie and Avatar The Last Airbender.

@blairbeveridge @OmarNajam That and I'm stopping the introduction of European bees to Australia. And The Last Airbender movie.
But can we talk about the avatar the last airbender movie and how it was worse than the Aaliyah movie
My two worst movies of the last several years is Avatar The Last Airbender and whatever the last Indiana Jones movie was called
The trailer for the latest M. Night Shyamalan movie leaves off that he directed The Last Airbender and After Earth, oddly
This live adaptation of Attack on Titan is just like The Last Airbender movie.
It's sad, sad day when I see a live-action and think, 'It feels like watching Avatar: The Last Airbender movie' all over again.
Sana ginawang film series yung The Last Airbender. Each book isang movie
Remember how terrible the Avatar the Last Airbender movie was??? M Knight ShyamaLAME.
I feel paying to see that Fantastic Four movie would be almost as bad as paying to see The Last Airbender movie. Almost.
@TitantesterZoe @diabolicshortie The same reason race mattered in The awful movie adaptation of Avatar: The last Airbender
"The Last Airbender" movie received 5 Razzie awards including: Worst Picture, Worst Director, and "Worst Eye-Gouging Mis-Use of 3D".
The fact that whoever made The Last Airbender movie decided the fire nation should be indian and the rest of the world white....
Watching the Live Action *Attack on Titan* Movie! Will it be as bad as the Last Airbender? http://www.gooddrama.net/japanese-movie/attack-on-titan-2015 …
@robeeaquino it's out already? Heard it ended up being like The Last Airbender movie...
Fantastic Four (2015) is a terrible movie, but at least it's not M. Night Shyamalan Avatar: The Last Airbender Movie level of terrible.
That really wasn't bad for an M. Night movie. Kind of redeemed himself after Avatar: The Last Airbender
Love how the entire cast of the Last Airbender movie is white
@royalpizzaboy "Avatar: The Last Airbender was a good movie"
YOU KNOW WHY IM MAD BECAUSE THEY MADE AN AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER MOVIE,THE END WAS A CLIFFHANGER AND THEY NEVER MADE A #2 I WANT THEM DEAD
The worst movie I've watched is Avatar: The Last Airbender. I stopped after 20 minutes
Just remembered how they pronounce "Aang" in the Last Airbender movie & that got me upset

Attack on Titan movie is just like the Last Airbender movie #extremely disappointing
The Blow Remix is like The Last Airbender Movie. Take that as you will.
@kszwartz That dragon ball live action was the best suicide risk of a movie I seen. The last airbender never happen.
So just how bad was the Fantastic Four movie on a scale of Nicholas Cage to The Last Airbender?
hope Attack on Titan doesn't pull a The Last Airbender and completely blow as a live-action movie
i'm still disappointed with the 'avatar: the last airbender' movie like the show was badass and they could've done better on the film

I will never forgive M. Night Shyamalan for fucking up The Last Airbender movie.
The Last airbender movie was garbage idc what nobody says.
With as much money as a new DBZ animated movie makes, it seems crazy there haven't been Avatar the Last Airbender animated sequel films.
I think they need to remake the 2010 movie The Last Airbender, and recast everyone, esp. Katara she suckedd.
Avatar The Last Airbender was dope...the movie sucked ass tho... just like the dragon ball movie which was ass trash!
the avatar the last airbender movie was the biggest flop of every movie ever made

I'd uninstall the live action Avatar The Last Airbender movie directed by @MNightShyamalan
My fav feel-good movie is Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Rent. TV show is Avatar: The Last Airbender #JMMP
Rewatched The Last Airbender (series, not movie) for the first time since the first. It really is a masterful piece of work.
@elybeatmaker lol no. Its supposedly almost as bad as the last airbender. Which was rated worst movie of all time lol

The only movie that I can remember in recent memory that was worse than the new Fantastic Four was The Last Airbender.
My brother's stupid. He thought The Last Airbender was a good movie.
@anthony_rotella @italianjob99 @JStramenga hey. HEY. The last Airbender was a GOOD MOVIE! (Said no person ever)
Someone needs to make an 8 movie series for Avatar: The last Airbender like they did for Harry Potter @wbpictures @DisneyStudios
I'm sorry if you've seen the last airbender movie
I don't think I have witnessed more uninteresting characters in a movie since The Last Airbender #FantasticFour
The last airbender was disaster..my fav turn into crap movie.. https://twitter.com/SMACbunny/status/629863791778471936 …
@SMACbunny i love the last airbender show but the movie was disgusting
#FantasticFour now has a lower @IMDb rating than The Last Airbender. Fox, making a movie just to keep the rights to it doesn't inspire much.
So. wow Fantastic four is tankn so bad, on rotten tomatoes alone it is BARELY above Avatar the Last Airbender the movie, and half of pixels
I mean I saw The Last Airbender and that the WORST movie ever
Do not be deceived by Fantastic 4's preview. The Last Airbender movie was better that's how bad it was .
The new Fantastic 4 movie is getting scores that rival live action Dragon Ball Z and The Last Airbender. Topkek. Good. It looks like shit.
Wow, people are saying that the new Fantastic Four movie is worse than the Last Airbender movie..
"I have The Last Airbender movie, I can lend it to you, as long as you promise to never return it to me" - @Oceansandrew quote of the day.
i am still recovering from The Last Airbender hollywood movie
up to now, the castin' choice for 'the last airbender' movie still baffles me............ O_o xo
The @Stonewall_Movie might actually be worse than the Last Airbender. #NotMyStonewall
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/s1fns8-tn3Q?a  Avatar: The Last Airbender: The REAL Movie

@kimtairi that is an ultimate comfort movie series. Avatar, the last Airbender is my #comfortshow
I'd rather rewatch The Last Airbender movie than the Republican Debate
I have never felt anger towards a film like the anger I feel towards The Last Airbender movie.
don't even try to argue with me about bad tv show to movie adaptations until you've seen avatar: the last airbender the live action movie.
(bc that would be lower than the Last Airbender rating, IF THERE WAS A MOVIE, which there totally never was) pic.twitter.com/b8WML5obtu
Serously, which was worse DragonBall's live action movie or The last Airbender's live action movie?
I keep hearing Fantastic Four was bad..Like Avatar the Last Airbender (movie) bad
@chappy422 I'm thinking of Signs and The Last Airbender movie.
#Fant4stic really showing the title is showing the movie is bad news. Just like The Last Airbender
Though, this was exactly the thought process that led it me watching Avatar: The Last Airbender movie in theaters...
i never saw the last airbender movie but i feel obligated to ask for my money back

@thebaq5 the last Airbender movie
Yes. I'm watching the Last Airbender movie. The movie. Rest in pieces.
Moon landing conspiracy theorists are on the same level of intellect as people who think the "Avatar: The Last Airbender" movie was okay.
I wonder what it'd be like if someone made "Avatar: The Last Airbender" into a movie with real people That'd be something, right?
Sitting in the therapist lobby and they put on The Last Airbender, showing that movie is the opposite of helping people's mentality
I still can't get over how "The Last Airbender"movie sucked. NOTHING compared to the animated series.
The Last Airbender - Really M. Night Shyamalan? You couldn't make the best animated series into a decent movie! #RuinAThriller @midnight
@Jam883 a reboot of The Last Airbender movie @saabmagalona
the last airbender movie is a very sensitive topic, one that I never engage in but listen to others talk about it from afar
I think we should start treating the New52 like the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie.
@Only_Halcyon @priyatheindian I had a feeling it would be like how they made avatar the last airbender a trash movie

@SteveSince90 for the sake of making my argument stronger, imma mention the astro boy movie and the last airbender
@justin_olin @dylanjbaker4 M. Night Shyamalan made that movie. But he also made Avatar The Last Airbender. Did you like that movie?
the worst movie i've ever watched was the last airbender that movie is to be frowned upon. they should go back in time and not do that movie
I wished they would make another avatar the last airbender movie
if i could delete something permanently from the face of the earth, i'd delete the last airbender movie

Don't make Naruto into a live action film.. Please God no.. Not after The Last Airbender and the DBZ movie. Not ever Satan not ever
The last two times Hollywood tried to adapt a cartoon into a movie, we get dragonball evolution and the last airbender. Naruto is next lol
@LeanandCuisine it will be a disgrace just like Avatar: The Last Airbender was That movie was so disappointing I went home and cried fam.
@MNightShyamalan I love your movie The Last Airbender. It perfectly captures the magic of the animated series. Will you ever make part 2&3?
a real life naruto movie? you bet your ass I'm gonna watch it, it can't be as bad as the last airbender movie...or can it?
@StephietheStars @rjlackie DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE FOR AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER.
wait... naruto live action movie?????? did hollywood not learn w the last airbender and that dbz movie
Years later, I'm still mad as hell at the avatar the last airbender movie cause i'm a big fan of the show and that movie was unacceptable
If Lionsgate decides to make the Naruto live action movie, it better not end up like The Last Airbender
Better not be shitty like dragon ball evolution or the last airbender Those movie sucked ass

The Last Airbender was such a shitty movie. Yet Hollywood's take on Dragonball Z made it look Oscar worthy.

Emmy is making me watch the WORST movie ever and I've seen Grown Ups 2, and also the Avatar The Last Airbender Movie so that's saying a lot
I'm getting pissed off cause I'm remembering how shit the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie was. I can't describe my hatred for the producer.

The movie, Avatar, The Last Airbender will look very stupid in production, that is, without the digitally enhanced bending...
The 2014 turtles movie is to the TMNT franchise as The Last Airbender was to the Avatar franchise. The parallels are too obvious to ignore.
Nothing made me cringe more than the avatar the last airbender movie. I really hate it.. everything is so wrong.

@BeardedJeff the last airbender was a terrible movie but a great show, what a dichotomy
@chopsherlock12 the 1 exception being avatar the last airbender because that movie was ass

@MNightShyamalan I'm really upset about the fact that you didn't continue the movie "Avatar: the last airbender" Will there be another one?
People warned about watching The Last Airbender the movie and they were right. Throughout the movie all I could think of was What?!?!
This movie is worse than The Last Airbender and that's saying a lot
Remember the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie where Aang was basically a bald Miranda Cosgrove and Dev Patel was there

#IThoughtYouSaid that The Last Airbender movie was good. In fact I know that's what you said you lying son of a bitch.
If my past relationship was a movie, it would be Avatar: the Last Airbender, because it took place in 2010 and we pretend it didn't happen.
i still yearn for the day when they remake the live action Avatar: The Last Airbender movie and a real director does it
But my biggest regret is that the first movie I ever saw at midnight was the live action of Avatar the Last Airbender
If you ever feel the need to watch The Last Airbender movie, just watch Ember Island Players. It's perfect.

Can't decide which movie is worse, The Last Airbender or Dragonball Evolution. #trash #baddecisionsweremade
I've never seen the A:TLA movie but I liked parts of Dragon Ball so maybe I should watch The Last Airbender too?

I think the last airbender movie is going to be better than that and that dragon ball movie! That says a lot!
Why did they feel the need to turn Avatar The Last Airbender into a movie? #StillSalty
@brixtronix @Astojap you're challenging me, ok then The Last Airbender movie all of the movie itself
I hear he wrote the screenplay for the avatar the last airbender movie
Maybe The Last Airbender movie was actually a movie about S3E17: The Ember Players. It would explain so much!
Still struggling to believe how much of a joke The Last Airbender movie adaptation was. Absolutely M. Night Shatupon the original cartoon.

@NeKap To me, the only scenes that blew me away in 3D were the landscape shots from The Last Airbender. Bad movie, but breathtaking visuals.
Avatar as in the blue people... Not the Last Airbender.. That movie sucked balls.
no movie has ever pissed me off more then the last airbender movie did

I watch The Last airbender movie frequently. It's like torture, but I just love the franchise so much
Still can't get over how badly they butchered Avatar the Last Airbender movie. It's like no one watched the TV Show before producing it.
@pooroldkilgore @CitricSilver omg The Last Airbender is a travesty of a movie. It's pure awful on every possible level.

Was the Last Airbender movie just a huge troll? How could someone make something and balls it up that bad? Was it an art piece or a seizure?
The last airbender had to be my favorite movie of all time

Dear gawd, they're showing the movie The Last Airbender on the bus. Its like they don't want us to have a good trip.
Then there's Avatar (not the last airbender movie), Guardians of the Galaxy, Blade Runner, Blade
I just hope this attack on titian movie isn't a train wreck like The Last airbender was. #whoTFisUng
Okay they are Changing so much in the Attack on Titan movie I think it's gonna be another the last Airbender where it sucks major ass!
@ChrisLT_ @silenthooper THAT MOVIE WAS SO FUCKING GARBAGE. THAT and M.Knight's Avatar the last airbender.
Not even close its evolution. Almost ruined DBZ “ @LILNTHEBASEDGOD: what was worst dragon ball evolution or the last airbender movie”
#UnpopularOpinion The Last Airbender, the movie, isn't as bad as people say. It's still shit but I like the way fire bending was changed.
The Last Airbender movie was a flop. They should remake the movie with familiar faces. Naya Riviera can be Azula.
@bilIyjoeI I think Avatar the Last Airbender (the movie) is the actual definition and Sandlot 2 is the synonym tbh
Idk The Last Airbender movie was pretty bad too
“ @iMRandom22: 15. What was the worst movie you've ever seen?” The Last Airbender

@TLT16 @stormydawnc some people claim there was a movie called The Last Airbender. I have no idea what they're talking about
“ @WestRosecrans: Avatar: The Last Airbender ” Show is good that movie was trash though.
So as a gag we introduced Ashli to just how bad The Last Airbender movie is. I think I was physically hurt on this viewing.
@Mitch577 THAT WAS WORSE THAN THE AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER LIVE MOVIE AND THATS LIKE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
