Of all of these candidates, Jim Webb is most likely to be president in a disaster movie
I'd definitely vote for O'Malley to play POTUS in a disaster movie circa 1996
Martin O'Malley, top Presidential candidate in any Hollywood disaster movie that claims political leaders are ineffectual.
Martin O'Malley would make a great looking president in a natural disaster movie. #DemDebate
Jim Webb gets my vote for Actor who Looks Presidential in a Disaster Movie. #DemDebate
Jim Webb looks like the president in every disaster movie ever, except the ones starring Harrison Ford (obviously)
