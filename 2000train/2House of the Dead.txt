I believe that Uwe Boll should make another zombie movie, because House of the dead is a modern zombie masterpiece
@SEGANerds @GamesDoneLegit when will the Sega Rave be? i need to see some overlaid house of the dead footage over my horror movie
@mikesacco curl up to doge watch a movie on Netflix. Might I suggest house of the dead 2 Ironicly hilarious but if not boring & sleep fodder
So after the movie, I spent a few quarters at the arcade. House of the Dead never gets old.
ハウス・オブ・ザ・デッド／HOUSE OF THE DEAD http://dlvr.it/75Hh5c  #映画
@gameinformer No. The only movie that I thought was good and even better than the game was House of the Dead.
Repeating myself, but, House of the Dead is like a really bad fan movie of the original game. Boll just seem to do bad tribute movies.
BTW, tonight's movie is House of the Dead. Our second Uwe Boll movie in our list. #100badmovies

Uwe Boll probably ruined it but House of the Dead: Overkill should really be a movie.

by the way, _House of the Dead II_ (the movie) is, unsurprisingly, terrible. But, somewhat surprisingly, it's no more terrible than the 1st.

House of the Dead: As soon as they decide they will all hide in the house, the rest of the movie is filled with awesomely terrible action.
I like how Uwe Boll made sure to put 1 second clips of the game into random spots in the House of the Dead movie.
Fourteen minutes in, and a third pair of boobs. Still no horror. And no house. For a movie called House of the Dead, this is unexpected.

@stevefireland if you still have that Wii you have to get House of the Dead - Overkill. Twisted zombie B-movie gore fest - 8/10 #fb
#Dumbestmoviesever House of the dead, epic movie, police academy and mac & me. Didn't like em.
Free movie tuesday with greg. We got here too early to go in so we hit up some house of the dead and then we cruised exotica.
House of the Dead is definitely the horror movie to see this Halloween.
Zombie Fest continues - Sat, Oct 24 Resident Evil “Degeneration” movie and House of the Dead video game tournament http://ow.ly/w2G1

House Of The Dead 2 Movie = sucks, bad acting, bad make up, everythings sucks

#watching house of the dead 2 in tv.. hmm.. i love zombie's movie.
House of the Dead RT @Newtman1976: @D_MacPherson What was the piece of crap with the video game edits spliced into the movie?
Liking House of the Dead Overkill on the Wii, B-Movie zombie blasting goodness!
watched house of the dead last night OOF bad movie. but filmed in Vancouver. 3rd time I watch it :/ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317676/
House of the Dead: Overkill and the movie Zombieland should be a 2 pack. fun movie. http://www.zombieland.com/trailer/
Raptor Island was the worst movie I've ever watched. Much worse than Bloodrayne, Postal or even House of the Dead. It was great fun though!
Funny, the Dawn of the Dead remake beginning sounds exactly like the House of the Dead 2 beginning. The game, not the movie.
@scottsigler House of the Dead.... HORRIBLE movie
@djmotwister ive already seen one movie where zombies swim.. i think its House of the Dead.. so theres no way out.. LOL =))
Playing House of the Dead: Overkill made me realize that Samuel L. Jackson needs to be in every zombie movie ever.
Movie alert: House of the Dead 2: In Guesta Verde University, the deranged Professor Curien is try.. http://bit.ly/1mz5bJ
I have to say that Zombieland's more like a House of the Dead movie and an RE movie than the real things.
...wow. it just hit me that Eric from Wonderfalls was in the crappy House Of The Dead movie.
House of the Dead is a really bad movie. Notice the intercut game footage: http://j.mp/FShcj -- but Transformers 2 is worse.
@ultratumba Don't know which is scarier. The House of the Dead movie or the picture in my head of the Backyardigan on the Hello Kitty bed.
FTR House of the Dead Overkill is freaking awesome! It screams Q Tarrantino. Like playing thru a movie!
@systech Enjoy seeing your school turn into the setting for a new House of the Dead movie.
good night last night. food, pina colada, old friends, new friends, House of the Dead 4, Tekken 4, DDR, & a Sailor Moon movie. Thnx every1!

Dear Robert Rodriguez, please make a House of the Dead: Overkill movie. Preferably with Samuel L. Jackson.
@SEGA Oh crap, the house of the dead movie has a sequel :( .
yup, go figure, house of the dead is on this list. god that was such a bad movie. easily the worst movie ive seen so far
@TheAlvaro Doesn't Shaun of the Dead fit this? Unless I'm mistaken, so does House of the Dead. One of those is a good movie, one isn't.
90 minutes left for Zombithon 2009 so I'm going to end it on the best zombie movie ever : House of the Dead.
@southquarter House of the Dead? xD Worst video game movie EVER. But it basically happens anywhere in bad horror movies.
Playing The House of The Dead Overkill On Wii on Directors Cut... It´s Like a movie from the 70´s... It´s what i call Taking a Break °_°U
Game-to-movie director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) wanted to direct WoW! Ha! I suppose Sam Raimi of Spider-Man fame would be better.
Played "The House of the Dead: Overkill" and "MadWorld," two M-rated, B-movie-themed games for the Wii. Both are amusing, gory, and stylish.
I thought House of the Dead was supposed to be a horror movie . . . turning out to be a comedy.
From "sixteen candles" to "house of the dead" were will this movie marathon go next?
Blasting through House of the Dead: Overkill with my brother. If it were a movie, it would definitely be a Weekend B-Movie Pick. I love it.
James Brond often tries to quote literature, not realizing he's really quoting the first House of the Dead movie #jamesbrondfacts
To House of the Dead Overkill έχει τόσο b-movie vibe το καταδιασκεδάζω! Β- Μοvies για πάντα!!! χα,χα,χα
Im going to play House of the dead overkill on wii, then eat, movie, and sleep.
Idea for the best bad movie ever: Patrick Swayze. Uwe Boll. "Road House of the Dead."
Trying 2 Watch My Friend Jason's Movie, "House of the Dead." Mann It's Bad!
@SeanMBurns Exact same thing happened to me w/ Uwe Boll's THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD. At least that movie knew it was garbage.
Just finished House Of The Dead: Overkill. It had cheesy dialogue and was very funny. It was like a 70's B-Movie.
http://bit.ly/KW4WR And this is the movie offspring of Dead Rising and House of the Dead 4. So cool!!
@iggyosorio They have a new House of the Dead Game I diddn't see it there. I love that movie did you get to the lawnmower scene yet
Hahaha house of the dead.. The movie or game?
Also bought True Blood for $40, CM S1 for $20, a 3 pack movie set on Gacy, Dahmer & Gein. Wii - new house of the dead & coraline. >>
@SurviveZombies The worst zombie movie of all time is definitely Uwe Boll's "House of the Dead" - Worst. Zombie. Movie. Ever.
House of the Dead: Overkill is like playing a grindhouse movie. Continuous F-Bombs, strippers, and zombies, it's all good.
@JhonenV Never fallen asleep, but only ever walked out on one movie; House of the Dead.
@RealAudreyKitch no no no Uwe Boll's House of the Dead is the worst movie EVERRRR! if you don't belive me, Netflix that, lol
see "House of the Dead" to write reviews for my movie group
I #blamedrewscancer for the movie, House of the Dead.
Ultimatum: Surfer, Dude is the worst movie ever made. It's even worse than the remake of Rollerball and Uwe Boll's House of the Dead.
Best adult 2-player fun on the Wii: House of the Dead: Overkill - playing a Quentin Tarantino movie...
Dinner, Time Crisis 2/House of the Dead, fun movie, good company. Tonight was good.

Quizás no tanto, ni de lejos, como "The house of the dead: the movie".
House of The Dead Overkill for #Wii!!! Feels like you are inside a #Tarantino Movie!! Awesome Game!! Recommend.
#crapsuperpowers anything from the movie "house of the dead"
@Unusual_Peanut I have no idea what House of the Dead is lol. Didn't you ever see the movie House of 1000 Corpses directed by Rob Zombie?

@tromboneforhire House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and that awful "gaming" movie CliffyB consulted for (name eludes me) all to be skipped
Everytime I see House of the Dead game, I want to see Uwe Boll movie.
I don't care what people say, Doom is one of the best video games turned movie. The worst you ask? House of the Dead. What a crap fest!
Got House of the Dead Overkill yesterday... been shooting zombies all night.... Gory B-movie goodness! :)
Gonna have a bad movie night (House of the Dead) with some Chinese food for dinner. What a killer combination! ;)
really xbox? you put uwe bolls bullshit movie house of the dead as a premiere "horror movie" that movie barely even qualifies as shit!
I think this movie is based off the House of the Dead games. It might actually have a *worse* plot.
house of the dead is indeed the worst movie ever made, and its easy to see why..thanks Uwe Boll for ruining your own career with this trash
Saw House of The Dead Movie and It Wasn't that Sucky as People Claimed It To Be
Playing house of the dead overkill very good game and it plays out like a b movie brilliant fun
Added a new movie to the site: "The House of the Dead" http://tinyurl.com/d4s37e
No one get excited about Shadow of Colossus The Movie. Remember Street Fighter,Doom,Tomb Raider,House of the Dead,Hitman,Double Dragon, etc!
Ew, they made a House of the Dead 2? (movie, mind you) But hey, there's Emmanuelle! Madison really was a step up for you huh? & CSINY...
I'm watching House Of The Dead 2. It's a pretty cool B movie.
Playing house of the dead overkill for wii...kind of cool with a b horror movie feel.
@wiigamereview House of the Dead. No great story, LOTS of swearing 70's B-Movie style.Very funny and enjoyable on a no brainer type of level
Sidetracked by house of the dead overkill (with hand cannon) on the wii. 18 only carnage with b-movie styling. Go for slow mo-fo mode! Class
Watching "House Of The Dead" movie is just like the game, except you don't get to shoot the zombies.
Just got done watching the house of the dead haha.... Great movie!!
Wow, idk what to think about anything. But House of the Dead is the FUNNIES movie i have EVER seen! 360 degree shots of every character. LOL
An unrelated note: "House of the Dead" may be my favorite movie ever.
Great movie on scifi chan: House of the Dead - 'Party-bound young people encounter bloodthirsty zombies on an island'
ok on sci fi this has to be the cheesiest zombie flick to date....zombies that swim come on.......movie "House of the Dead"
watching my first Uwe Boll movie... House of the Dead on SyFy. holy bawlz it's horrible.
Watching "House of the Dead" on SciFi. It's an Uwe Boll movie. Enough said.
OMG!!! "House of the Dead" is on Sci-Fi!!!! Best movie ever!!!!!!! (Ironically, I actually did love the arcade game. Didn't marry it tho.)
uwe boll made a house of the dead movie?
@LittleLaura Sounds like a scene out of horror movie or House of the Dead!
"The House of the Dead: Overkill" is hilarious. It's HotD, 70's grindhouse movie-style. Now go buy my copy. http://tinyurl.com/ctgcfm
@WaleDC mamas foot, house of the dead, and black sheep (the horror movie) three of the worse films ever made

@Wossy but what did you think to the movie house of the dead?
The House of the dead movie is NOTHING like the video game. I feel jipped.
@Cskoyles. Haha, House of the Dead: Overkill is great. How did you find it? Love its Grindhouse, B-Movie theme.
@david_seymour I know one of the guys that starred in the original movie House of the Dead. What a baaaaaad movie that was!
House of the Dead Overkill has a cool cover. Oldschool grindhouse movie graphics on the front of the box.
House of the Dead: Overkill on Wii is the most hilarious over-the-top game ever. Tarentino/Rodriguez need the movie rights to this.
House of the Dead: Overkill. Motherfucker. This is fucking wonderful. 70's roadhouse zombie movie with me behind the gun.
HOUSE OF THE DEAD OVERKILL REVIEW • B-movie light gun action for the Wii, controls could be snappier, could be more gritty. Great game! 4/5

There's going to be a Street Fighter movie? Didn't they learn from House of the Dead?!
The House of the Dead movie is SO BAD.
@brianszabelski Anything, and I mean ANYTHING is better than house of the dead. This movie is wretched!
Uwe Boll's House of the Dead movie is awesomely terrible. Jurgen Prochnow, David Palffy + it has Erica Durance topless. I approve!
House of the Dead II...not really a house. It's a college campus...but still zombie movie. Follows the rules pretty well. An okay watch.
Played "Rayman Raving Rabbids 2," a great party game, and "House of the Dead III," classic rail shooter complete with B-movie voice acting.
watched "House Of The Dead" on a schlock DVD collection. To his surprise, he actually saw it over 20 years ago on "Elvira's Movie Macabre."
Can't sleep! So I'm watching the movie - House of the Dead 2 - on Sci-Fi in an attempt to lull myself to sleep.
Watching what could be the worst movie ever. House of the Dead
movie titles cont... Or 'House of the Dead.'
saw the new batman movie tonight it was good...now for more house of the dead 3 zombies fear my wii zapper skills :D
Today's crappy movie is brought to us by House of the Dead 2! These people know squat about zombie hunting, seriously...
Just rented Bee Movie. ITS SO GOOD. And Lego Indiana Jones + House of the dead 2 & 3. Wooooo.
@majornelson Tell Uwe Boll House of the Dead is the worst (videogame) movie ever made.
