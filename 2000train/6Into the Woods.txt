Fuck yea! Just discovered I have Into The Woods on demand so random because I've been wanting to watch this movie for weeks.
hearing the name Meryl Streep then thinking about into the woods and then about the only reason why I watched that movie
Into the woods is probably the worst movie ever.....
The movie was not good what we saw it. It is called "Into the Woods" and I think it was pretty weird drama about a witch!
MVP in Into the Woods is no question Jack. Easily the most impressive actor in the whole movie (besides Streep but that's different.)
Bringing back the movie into the woods watching it

Into The Woods is the weirdest movie. I'm so confused....
ICYMI: Into the Woods is the best musical movie of all time. The end. @JKCorden @latelateshow
movies to watch with me if you want to hear me sing terribly: Into The Woods, Grease, Sweeney Todd, Mamma Mia, Annie, even The Muppets Movie
Into the Woods is a boring movie sry
Into The Woods is possibly the stupidest movie I've ever seen
You can complain about movie-musicals like Les Mis, Into the Woods, and especially Chorus Line; but if u even touch West Side I swear to god
Into the Woods is a good movie..but too much singing
Into The Woods is such a good movie.
After going to a few stores before successfully finding it, I eventually managed to buy 'Into the Woods.' I think a movie night is needed.
Rapunzel's prince in the Into the Woods movie is so Marius I'm laughing he falls over because he sees a pretty girl he rips open his shirt-
Into the Woods was a very strange movie (coming from someone who knew nothing about it and didn't watch a preview before seeing it)

"Into the woods" the Disney movie was the worst musical I think Disney has done it was boring as fuck and way to many songs and little lines
