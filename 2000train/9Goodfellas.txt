Literally the saddest moment in movie history is when Henry gives up Paulie on the stand in Goodfellas
@ImpressionistAL I think you should recreate the Goodfellas movie.... With you playing ALL the characters! You're comedy gold pal
The Lufthansa heist is the most famous unsolved case in U.S. History. Its also famous for inspiring the greatest movie ever - Goodfellas

@dloomis24 @8goingon80 I beg to differ good sir. Goodfellas stands on it's own with one movie.
@8goingon80 It's the original gangster/mafia movie. None of the newer ones come close to comparing. Not even Goodfellas.

No movie is Goodfellas in the postmodern age. It took a whole TV series to match it, and I'm not sure The Sopranos did.

Watched Wolf of Wall Street last night. Why did this movie win so many awards? It's just a remake of Goodfellas with fewer guns.
@xZacFolkx @theLowestTee he was saying the departed and goodfellas were terrible to me earlier also, so discredit him on movie taste.
Fenna watch my FAVORITE movie ..... GOODFELLAS
I saw Black Mass again. It's so refreshing that we have a Goodfellas-caliber movie for this generation. Outstanding.
Goodfellas has gotta be a top 3 movie of all time
@_wintergirl93 Love that movie! Kinda like I watch Goodfellas whenever it's on.
Anyone that says a movie's just as good without the swears hasn't seen the atrocity of the edited versions of Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction.
#Legend was such a sh*t movie! They should have made a hard hitting British gangster movie, like goodfellas / casino / godfather
joke in movie goodfellas. LMFAO, wife: I want to go somewhere I've never been before, husband: try the kitchen..
Black mass is the modern day goodfellas! Dope movie.
I watched Goodfellas and now I just want a gangster boyfriend :/ That's all I got out of the movie. Gangster boyfriends are good and great
watching GoodFellas aka THE BEST MOVIE EVER
@AceofSpadesHQ #MartinScorsese has made one great movie, #Goodfellas which is a masterpiece. #TheDeparted seemed contrived to me.

Goodfellas is my favorite mobster movie of all time. Respect to The Godfather but, Joe Pesci speaks to me.
If you think any movie is better than Goodfellas or The Godfather you're wrong and should go peep both
I believe Goodfellas is the greatest movie, but I'd prefer to watch Heat. Strange, I know.
@donwinslow Heat is by far the better movie. It's timeless. Goodfellas suffers from 90's sensibilities.

Anyone who compares it to “Goodfellas” is nuts. That movie was about reprehensible people, but it was paced and measured.

Imagine the movie Goodfellas but with all the characters vaping instead of smoking.
Imagine if movie mobsters were like that, just dealing beatdowns for anything. Oh, wait, that's Joe Peschi's character in Goodfellas.
