Fight club seriously has the best quotes of any movie ever
“We’ve all been raised on television to believe that 1 day we’d be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t.” –Fight Club
My favourite 3 movies: 1) Fight Club(1999) 2) The Matrix (1999) 3) Pokemon (1998 the first movie)
The fighting in Fight Club was more mixed martial arts than boxing . Brilliant movie though.
I think the movie fight club should happen in real life. We need a new ground zero.

@goodreads Fight Club movie best adaptation so far.
Saw someone say "Here's a movie you won't find people making nowadays" about FIGHT CLUB and I have no idea what the fuck he's talking about
There is a cup of coffee in every scene of the movie Fight Club.
+1 RT @RyanBaxmaster: Fight club book is better than fight club movie because chapter 30.
I watched Fight Club and didn't even realize what movie it was until like two hours into it.
Fight Club's been my favorite movie since I was a kid. Maybe I was abnormal lol
Also Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, The Godfather, whatever other movie you like, it was a bad movie.
@moratorium (I presume you've read a lot of these) Ms. Marvel, Fight Club 2 (if you liked the book/movie), Lumberjanes, Saga
If your movie isn't FIGHT CLUB and ends with 'Where Is My Mind' by Pixies, your movie is probably not good.
Fight club is possibly the best movie I've ever seen. EVER. EVER.

When you think about it, 1st rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club applies to both the club and the movie so ending not spoiled.
@dylan_vicars Yes, I really enjoy that movie, too. It's my second favorite movie next to Fight Club. Heath Ledger was brilliant as The Joker

i love Mr Robot so far but I've noticed so many similarities to Fight Club and now they actually take a song straight from the movie
#MrRobot = 80% Fight Club 10% Asperger's 10% actors who look like they should be in a vampire movie
So I'm watching Fight Club and tell me why it's set up almost like The Machinist, I'm calling it rn the whole movie is one big trip
#MrRobot is entirely too much like the movie Fight Club. So Elliot is Edward Norton & his Dad is Brad Pitt....hmmmm. So who else isn't real?

You can't use "Where is my mind" by Pixies in a movie, not since FIGHT CLUB used it perfectly. Looking at you, WELCOME TO ME.
@Cornelius_TD ye watching this Raze? Surprisingly sadistic, thought it was some daft Fight Club rip-off B-movie crap.

Every time I approach my microwave I think of the movie fight club. Don't ask me why because I don't know.
*2015 me appears in my college dormroom* Fight Club doesn't age well and honestly it's just not that good of a movie to begin with. Bye.
For the movie Fight Club (1999) Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter spent 3 days recording orgasmic sounds for their unseen sex scenes
My favorite movie is a tie between Juno, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Fight Club, and The Breakfast Club
There is a cup of coffee in every scene of the movie Fight Club.
come to think of it, if the characters never broke the 1st and the 2nd rules of fight club...the movie wouldn't exist.

So I just saw the movie Fight Club the other day and that's shit blew my mind lol
Fight Club's my least favourite David Fincher movie. Zodiac, Panic Room, Gone Girl, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Seven are where it's at.
Fight Club was the greatest movie made

I find it very ignorant of people when they say they love the movie Fight Club but they have never read the book. That's being a fake fan.
Shawshank Redemption rated best movie of all time by IMDB. Fight Club rated number 10
