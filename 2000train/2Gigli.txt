Seriously that movie was horrible! What? I finally got around to watching "Gigli" last night.
Star Wars movie is coming out tonight. More exciting news I just ate dinner
@14TeamMocker @BenGretch Have you guys heard of this classic movie with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez called "Gigli?" Looks great TBH
#StarWarsSpoilers The movie is only 15 minutes long. The rest of the run time is Gigli 2.
@JesCoolbaugh But they’re never as bad/funny as you’re expecting them to be. With the exception of Gigli. That movie lives up to the awful.
@Eoisit the Gigli movie reference. How it was such a great movie for Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.
. @knappad, I'm thinking this movie could be the likes of "Ishtar meets Gigli" & it'd still surpass $1.5 Billion - and - I'd watch it (2x).
Disaster Movie: No its not Gigli! #ExplainAFilmPlotBadly
The Ridiculous 6 is probably the worst movie Ive seen in my life.. i would watch a Gigli marathon over it.
The new Hunger Games has got to have dethroned Gigli as the worst movie of all time. I assume the critics were unanimous?
"Gigli" (2003) is a straight-to-DVD level movie (F) #DallasCritic <nz9mp3>
i Frogot the movie Gigli existed
Me after watching the J Lo movie Gigli : Well the book was better than the movie . Friend : Which book ? Me : ANY BOOK !
someone name a bad ben affleck movie for me to watch rn. not gigli.
@sarahleigh27 @dallascowboys I'm going to be honest, I'm looking forward to this game about as much as watching the movie Gigli:(
Pearl Harbor Day is about WW2 –not a shitty Ben Affleck movie. I think. If it is, I hope to God there ain’t also a ‘Gigli’ Day.

Hopefully Ben Affleck doesn't ruin this movie...I mean daredevil was to comics what gigli was to any movie ever made https://twitter.com/SuperheroFeed/status/672593945684152320 …
@pxlsicle @Swazi4 @TACMON1 It's a good thing you guys saw a good movie. Imagine if you'd seen Gigli instead.
I'd rather watch Ben Affleck and Jlo's D-list movie "Gigli" on repeat for a week straight than read most of your stances on politics.
@valhallayo it gets me so upset all I think about is his role in the Gigli and wondering when JLo is gonna pop into the movie.
"Gigli" (2003) is a senseless movie (F) #DallasCritic <nyr2go>
@robin_ec I think they are super over kill now. I think that movie is fine. It ain't Gigli or whatever.
@el_duderino8184 lmao I rather have him on an island by himself and forced to watch that Gigli movie over and over again
@SuperheroFeed Waiting for the meme where Superman is the movie critic and they go: (mask off) SM:"Daredevil!", BM: "Argo!", SM: "Gigli!"
my favorite movie is "gigli" #BreakUpIn5Words @midnight
@davidlsims yeah. It looks like it has potential to overtake Gigli as the worst movie ever. I'm like actually angry at this trailer.
@AsUgDec5000 @krin_sin Yes CJ, and the movie Gigli desensitized us to you. @cjwerleman
This point break remake looks like the worst movie of all time might be worse than Gigli

Gigli is good movie
If you're looking for a movie to watch this Thanksgiving, may I suggest the JLo/Affleck classic Gigli?
I'm an Adam Sandler fan, but Jack and Jill has to be the worst movie ever made. Like Gigli was bad but it easily takes the cake.

Gigli is still the worst movie ever
Isn't this like asking which is the better movie - "Gigli" or "From Justin to Kelly" https://twitter.com/polls/status/665174791167438848 …
Wow. The Town on tv. The movie that made me fall in love with Ben Affleck. After Gigli.
Remember when two hot people made a movie and it was literally the worst thing ever? Get ready for Gigli 2 starring Brangelina.
Say the shit you will about Gigli & yes Mallrats is a funny movie, but Jersey Girl is fucking solid as a story. Best thing that Smith wrote.
My life is worse than that movie "Gigli".
Something borrowed may just be my least favourite movie of all time, and I've seen Gigli.
@zillieness Is the movie good at least? I mean I hope it isn't like Gigli bad or something
And Citizen Kane was a better movie than Gigli. https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/663490697471893504 …

Ben Affleck: So I'm being asked to be in this movie called "Gigli". Should I do it? Travis Scott: straight up!
@Grady Gigli — a bunch of stars collaborate to make a horrible movie that everyone wishes they hadn’t seen.
Am I the only one who remembers how offensive the movie Gigli is
I now understand why Ben Affleck didn't have more notes for Jason. He wanted to see a movie worse than Gigli. #TheLeisureClass

@redsteeze She confused 'Ben Ghazi' with 'Ben Affleck'. Thought they killed him over Gigli. That's where "movie musta killed 'em" started.

@noahpransky Agreed. No blank checks for movies like #Gigli Ben Affleck's #Ybor based movie would have been a good candidate.
@noahpransky Also the value of the movie's PR should be considered. Unless of course it's a movie like #Gigli ... that wouldn't work.
I have a great idea for a movie, but Hollywood passed on it to reboot Gigli #ReasonsIAmNotFamous
watching the movie Gigli #BetterThanLivinginReno
Back in my day we used "DTF?" instead of "Netflix and chill" and no one had to watch Gigli or a Tyler Perry movie. Clearly, we had it right.

I'll never be sold of Ben Affleck as Batman. I have dislike him since that movie Gigli with Jennifer Lopez. Horrible.
Gigli has to be the wackest movie I ever seen
I know I'll get a lot of flack for this... but Grease is the most over-rated movie. Ever. I'd rather watch Gigli on repeat for a week.

@CharlieThomas worst movie ever made. Worse than Gigli
Gigli, which was panned as one of the worst movies of all time, has an "18" Metascore. To get a 1, a movie literally has to kill its viewers
Gigli was a shit movie, but at least it taught people how to pronounce the Italian silent G. #brightside
@allenschauffler With due respect, Point Break is not remotely the worst movie ever made. Gigli, for starters, but there are plenty more.
No one can confirm Sepp Blatter's role in producing the movie Gigli.

@RadioDana Ben Affleck should feel guilty for that movie he made with JLo.... Gigli
I think #BenAffleck should have tried to suppress his history w/ the movie #Gigli more than his ancestor's past.
Reese Witherspoon comedy (I would rather watch all the Twilight movies, with Gigli being used as an intermission between each movie).
Gigli is by no means a good movie. It's a Tarantino retread, released when Tarantino retreads were not cool anymore. But worst movie ever?
Ben Affleck is ashamed of his Slave Owning Descendants, and his Slave Owning Descendants are ashamed of 'Gigli' and that 'Daredevil' movie.
Finally, something horrible about Ben Affleck's past that doesn't involve the movie "Gigli."

It's wild how J. Lo's movie career took a nosedive in the 2000's. She had "Selena," "Out of Sight" and, then, "Gigli"... smh my gawd
Look, "Gigli" was such a bad movie. Good grief.
Gigli. It was horrendous. Absolutely horrible. Nothing like it. “ @CHIMMYXIV: What's the worst movie you've ever seen?”
He's even the worst thing in GIGLI, which is a movie *filled* with candidates for worst thing.

Best Movie Ever. Gigli. #OffendEveryoneIn4Words
Not the best offensive performance from the Griz so far tonight. In the same way "Gigli" was not the best movie.
Ben Affleck in Gigli...wait that shouldn't have even been a movie. #PoorCastingChoiceForAMovie
@chowdersoop my mom also hated this movie but she liked gigli so her opinion sucks
Gigli is a great movie
The trailer for that Marshawn Lynch movie makes Gigli look like Casablanca.

Remember when The Oscars snubbed @JLo and her movie Gigli? I do. And I still haven't forgiven them.
You might remember Jennifer Lopez from the movie, "Gigli" or not because that was a garbage can of a movie. #Oscars

@JenLLM The movie Gigli, Ben Affleck and JLo. Panned as one of the worst movies of all time.
An anonymous source described 50 Shades as... "Worst movie ever made. Gigli but with tits. Terrible."- @tmole88
You mean it wasn’t the star of “Gigli” that died? The movie was “Gigi”? Never mind.
So Gigli is a bad movie, but in no way should it be #70 on @IMDb Bottom 100. It's at 2.3 and should be more of a 3.7. Our review next week.
I have to go out in a little while, I would rather watch the movie Gigli in German #freezinginnyc
Worst movie I've seen since Gigli
@taramorganxxx Not me. I heard the movie "Gigli" was way better. #Bennifer #Gigli
She says that @FiftyShades movie is the worst movie that she has ever seen - I am guessing she missed out on Gigli #LisaWilkinson #truth
If my love life were a movie, it would be Gigli. Even I'm unimpressed with my performance. pic.twitter.com/VAVe9xzPih
If the books R absolutely horrid, what makes U think the movie is even going 2 B good??? rather watch Gigli. #sheeple #FiftyShadesOfGrey
I would have never watched The Interview if North K prez didn't do all that he did. That movie was horrible! I mean below Gigli...
Omg I'm excited they playing Gigli i love this movie ...Jlo so damn fine

@MissZindzi the Aaliyah movie, The Wicker Man, Gigli
Had managed to purge Gigli from my mind until I was forced to remember it for a movie quiz. Let this be a lesson. Quizzes are the devil.
@ChristinaParkNY worst movie ever, "Gigli" #GobbleGobble
Brian Williams told me Gigli was a great movie. I'm beginning to think he was lying.
"Up for a Pacino movie marathon?" Sure! *plays S1m0ne* Dude. *plays Gigli* I don't think yo- *plays Cruising* *sobs* What is wrong with you?
@orchetect @Dusty_Kat So very many movie titles that works with…I submit Gigli, Catwoman, and Battlefield Earth. :-)
raise your hand if you've Ben severely Affleckted by the movie Gigli
Buckle up, kids. That movie sucked at levels not seen since Gigli 2: Getting Jigli and I need to vent about it.
Been watch Gigli for an hour and a half and I still have no idea what this movie is about...
@supertorrey @VSPorn that movie will be worse than Gigli, but as a guy I can't wait until after girls see it.
@ashtonraze Injustice 2 will reveal that Gigli exists as a movie in the DC universe. And it's Evil Superman's favourite movie.
At least the good thing is that this is not the worst movie J. Lo has ever been. Gigli should never have existed.
To tell you how Gigli did badly as a movie. They made $7.2 million against a $75.6 million budget.
Gigli is my favorite movie #FiveWordsToRuinADate
@Lonnen I'm not taking credit for that, it's hard to imagine how a movie pitched as "Bizarro Gigli" could somehow be not-doomed.
Can't believe I just watched 'Gigli'. This movie is not commendable in any way. Not even so bad it's good. I feel dirty
I ended up owing Blockbuster almost $200 for that movie in college. Gigli + Glitter. I hosted a bad movie night & forgot to return them.
Gigli. It's like Seinfeld but with Ben Affleck, JLo and the mentally challenged kid. That's it. Movie about nothing.
Similarly, if you want to show me that I'm wrong about Gigli being the best movie ever, do 500 push-ups and tattoo your opinion on my chest.
i hope this blizzard flops like that horrible jlo and ben affleck movie "gigli"

@mtats The Maid In Manhattan/Gigli/Jersey Girl trifecta really killed off her movie career
There doesn't seem to be much going on in football today. Maybe I'll watch that 2003 movie classic Gigli.
"Or we can talk about how Ben Afleck left eye twitches when you mention the movie gigli"
Wow! That Jennifer Lopez movie might be as bad as Gigli...or any other movie starring J. Lo
Coulda played the retard in Gigli and won an Oscar. " @AtPerin: Nope RT @WhatDaMoufDo: Has Denzel ever made a trash movie?”"

Anyone that didn't like Gigli should shut the fuck up and respect the boys because they've never been in a movie before.

As much as Song of the South is looked down upon, it should still be available to watch it can't be as bad as Gigli or The Smurfs movie
Bout to see the new movie with Madea and the cheesy dude from Gigli & Daredevil. Hope it doesn't suck!
I'm pretty sure I'm watching the worst movie of all time. Lance Bass and Joey FatOne star in "On The Line" #gigli sleeps well tonight.
Sorry @Sony, But you would've been better off never showing #TheInterview. That movie was almost as bad as #Gigli
movie day today gonna start with beyonces platinum edition then gigli then tbup maybe wtewye and so on #cozy
I wonder if people realize that the Interview is basically another Gigli. All this hoopla over a legit crappy movie, but I digress.
The quality of movie on the Hallmark channel declines greatly after midnight. They're all bad, but after 12, it's basically Gigli all over.
What if "The Interview"is the worst movie ever. Like the Gigli of this decade. Then what? #yeahisaidit
#UnreasonableMovieCriticism This movie attempted to reach the sophistication of "Gigli", but failed.
Ben Affleck coming from Gigli and Daredevil to where he is now makes me believe Nicholas Cage can still be saved from the movie abyss.
Not worse than Gigli by Ben & Jlo. " @KoolestKidOut: Mortal Kombat II might be the worst movie of all time."
Gigli is my favorite Christmas movie.
Somewhere, Ben Affleck gives sigh of relief that now the history books will show Sony hacking- and not Gigli- as biggest movie disaster ever
@misterpatches Terrific piece. Always thought GIGLI got too harsh of a rap. It wasn't even the worst Ben Affleck movie I saw that year.

North Korea calling The Interview “an act of war,” is the harshest thing that anyone has said about a movie since Gigli.

They're not showing The Interview in theaters? But they gladly played Gigli, 47 Ronin, & any movie with Daniel Craig? Now that is BULLSHIT!
#NaughtyListBecause I gave the movie Gigli , two thumbs up @midnight
How come there was no terroristic threats when Gigli came out in theatres or any movie made by Tyler Perry or Jingle all the way 2?
So, the movie #Gigli happened. Where were you on that one #NorthKorea #SonyHack
I wish someone had made terrorist threats to the movie theaters before Gigli came out.
Where were the North Koreans for Alfeck's movie "Gigli" or other terrible Hollywood films? Siskel & Ebert would be so envious! #TheInterview
i'm going to destroy any movie theaters that are going to show gigli. repeat: do not release gigli in theaters. this is your final warning
Nothing makes me want to see a movie more than pulling it from theaters. More importantly, why didn't they pull #gigli ? #TheInterviewMovie
Better shut the whole movie down gents. Someone said something bad on the internet. Where were the North Koreans when Gigli was being made?
Where were these movie theater hacktivists when Gigli was released?
The biggest shame is that there wasn't a way to work killing a Korean dictator into Gigli, Glitter, and the Spice Girls Movie. @JuddApatow
Why didn't we get all these threats against movie theaters when "Gigli" came out? Could have been a blessing then. LOL!
Terrorists are trying to stop the release of the movie "The Interview". Where were these people for the release Gigli ? #TheinterviewMovie
So empty threats are enough to cancel a movie? Why didn't anyone try to get Gigli out of theaters??? @TheInterview #TheInterviewMovie
Cyber-terrorists threaten movie-goers to stay away from The Interview. Where were they when Gigli and Ronin 47 were released? @absrdNEWS
Preach this gospel! “ @317zeph: Was it called Gigli? The JLo, Ben Affleck movie. Anyway, Arrow is on that level.”

But, really, I hope North Korea doesn't do anything to us because of some movie. Offensive movies get made all the time. One word: Gigli.

Yhuuu lo Gigli lowo! Nxa " @Mthunzi_S: Glitter. Into zojola kodwa :-( RT @Mtha_VeEkaY: Gigli for me is 'The BEST WORST movie' ever made "
Watching Argo on HBO. I'm giving Ben Affleck some cred - he's come a long way since Gigli #ArgoF*kYourSelf ( My fav quote from the movie )
Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake in a movie together?! It could be Gigli 2 and I would see it. #RunnerRunner
How bad does your movie have to be to get 2% on Rotten Tomatoes? I don't even thing Gigli rated that low
@texas839 lets face if Logan at this stage it's obvious that even Gigli (worst movie ever) could be on n it would distract you from your HW
I just watched the WORST Ben Affleck movie ever. Made Gigli look like masterpiece. "Of The Wonder". Absolutely awful.
K let me go on record and tell everyone that the brown rice triscuits are the biggest let down since the movie Gigli
Is that Ben Affleck movie, Gigli, about pasta? I sure hope it is.
@neiltyson So, the movie "Gigli", basically.
I would just play that movie Gigli on every TV screen, iPad, and cell phone. Gotham would have no choice but to cower to my evil.
Gigli(2003): Ben Affleck has trouble convincing his then-girlfriend that they shouldn't be in a movie together
戦煌はE49bでしたー チームBASARAの栄光THE MOVIEだすです！ 毎日ねこきもももっていくだすー
@hiphopdetroit The Dedication 5 was comparable to the movie "Gigli" ....yes it was SOOOO terrible, even Miley Cyrus is ashamed
And right Gigli came out 10 years ago as did Daredevil bring up some new shit ppl. Chris Evans was in bad movie as was RDJ. #wm40a
RIPD is probably the most painful movie experience you could get. Even worse than Gigli. Want my money back.
This movie is the Gigli of mockumentaries
FYI: If you quote from the movie Gigli enough, people will stop inviting you to parties. https://www.google.com/search?q=gigli&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&client=safari …
I want to see the movie where Gigli's parents die and he becomes the superhero.
@BenAffleck Batman isn't some shitty Gigli movie. Don't fuck this up.
Currently watching From Justin to Kelly. It has to be the worst movie bankrolled next to Gigli.
Baseline for any movie rating scale? Use a scale of #Gigli to 10 - http://wp.me/pTbw8-1sI  - Signs I've worked on #surveys too long #MRX
3 reasons why we shouldn't give Ben Affleck a chance in Batman: 1. Daredevil 2. He's not directing the movie, only starring in it. 3. Gigli
@itslauren_bitch i hope the new batman movie the sequel to gigli
In case you doubted the power of Batman, he can make you remember Reindeer Games was a movie and convince you that you actually saw Gigli.
Just as #BenAffleck rehabilitated himself with #Argo he picks up a movie role to send him back to Gigli
This is the Gigli of movie opinions. RT @DavidPoland: Anyone who compares any big movie from 2013 to Ishtar is a lazy thinker. @aoscott
Lets hope the newest Batman doesn't deliver another Gigli movie!! Best of luck Ben
I love bad acting and crappy writing. If you liked the movie Gigli, this Samsung ad is for you. http://on.mash.to/1dAv8wQ 
Have I forgiven Ben Affleck? Gigli is the worst film I have ever seen. It’s not a B movie… but it should have been…
@AnnieGirardYAY but but but... GIGLI! Judge him for a movie a decade ago!
@AngieGraceLA yeah... but not every movie deserves a second chance... Examples include Gigli and Ishtar :D
argo hailed as one of if not the best movie of 2012 yet people won't stop bringing up gigli
#ThingsObamaBlamesOnRush The movie Gigli.
I enjoyed Gigli ... shut up. I didn't say it was a good movie, I said I enjoyed it..
Ure favorite movie is Gigli?..ull love the new Batman.
I'm uncomfortable with the fact that ragging on "Gigli" is like our national inside joke when literally NO ONE has ever seen that movie.
I think there should be a law that if you were in the movie Gigli that you should never be able to be Batman.
Ben Aflleck is an acomplished writer and director, that being said no Kevin Smith movie, or Gigli, or Daredevil, or Reindeer Games...
@MezianeXY Yeah, sorry that was a joke. Gigli is like the worst movie ever made. But, don't worry I'm just jealous, I'm sure he'll be great
I mean, I did try to sneak into Gigli, but I wasn't 18, and I got ratted out 20 minutes in. J.Lo was cute, movie was a success. Right?
Even if Ben Affleck kills it at playing Batman, he will still be seen as a poor choice. Clearly the movie #Gigli still haunts him.
@rhinogregory @fredschmitt News Release: working title for Batman movie is "Batman & Gigli"
. @Aharp8 @natilieofficial Ben Affleck should be working on Gigli 2, not a Batman Vs. Superman movie #GetBenniferBackTogether
Gigli was the worst thing to ever happen in a movie theatre, until the Dark Knight shooting
The guy's last movie just won Best Picture, and all a lot of you guys can do is cling to making fun of ARMAGEDDON and GIGLI.
"Who should be our 2nd main character, Batman"? Oh! The guy who started in literally starred in the worst movie ever, Gigli.Problem solved!
Ben Affleck is Batman, but has anyone seen this Gigli movie?
Gigli was trending yesterday? I seriously didnt find that movie bad at all
Ben Affleck as the new Batman will make the movie as promising as Gigli.
@TMZ We hate it!!! It's DareDevil all over again. Worst movie next to Gigli.
@quaylestation Batman discovers superman's new weakness: making him watch the movie Gigli.
@azizonomics Ben Affleck ≠ Daniel Craig. Heard batgirl is to be played by J-Lo. Name of the movie is "Gigli 2: The Darker Knight."
Ben Affleck as Batman?!?! No man people!! The star of a movie called Gigli is gonna be Batman?! Please tell me this is a joke!!
@CivicScience What movie could possibly be worse the Gigli? Changing Lanes?
So you're telling me "Gigli" is actually a prequel to the new Batman movie? #Batfleck
Well, I've already added the batman/superman movie as one that will suck. Ben Affleck??? Really?? #daredevil #gigli #poop
Or they’re worried Batman ends up fighting an asteroid “ @MichaelClear: @Shooktacular People keep acting like Affleck’s only movie was Gigli.
BREAKING: New Batman movie starring Ben Affleck to be directed by Kevin Smith as the unofficial sequel to Gigli.
Ben Affleck made a movie called Gigli. He can't even save himself, how is he gonna save Gotham?
Guys. Obviously they would pick the best actor from the movie Gigli to play #Batman...what? They didn't pick J-Lo? oohh..
yeah RT @Shev_TheRealest: Worse than Gigli? RT ShawnaWTF: R.I.P.D is the worst movie ever.
I'll support Ben Affleck as Batman if we can erase his movie "Gigli" with J-Lo from all public records and databases. #ITNEVERHAPPENED
"Just when I think Gigli was your worst movie" Everyone chill… http://tinyurl.com/mbnshcn  #affleck #batman #superman
@scotonoia @mashable I don't get it!!! Haven't they seen Gigli or Dare Devil or that other crappy movie??!! #IHateYouHollywood
@evanbud @KPCC it's a sad day in the movie industry, the man that was in Gigli will play Bruce Wayne
*batman voice* ALFRED GIGLI WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE
In addition to getting the part, Ben Affleck submitted a manuscript for the movie as well. However, producers passed on "Batman and Gigli"
@BlackGirlNerds @PapaKennMedia Just not going to dump on Affleck for a 10 y.o. action movie that all-around bad, not just him...or for Gigli
*Batman Voice "Ben Affleck? The guy from Gigli? I approve, Gigli is my favorite movie of all time."
I saw GIGLI first show opening day. I spent one summer watching every Ben Affleck movie in order. We all have our kinks.
I wonder if the #Batman movie will have that Gigli kind of vibe. #BinAffleck
Remember Gigli with @BenAffleck and @JLo played a lesbian and somehow the movie still sucked?
Batman is to Affleck as Gigli is to a good movie. #Baffleck
The next Batman movie promises to be the best thing since Gigli! Maybe J-Lo could play Catwoman.
MG, Rumor is Ben Afleck as Batman will have a super power to erase the minds of people who saw the movie Gigli #Batman #BenAffleck @mg_indy
The new Batman used to star in the movie Gigli. Society is lost and no longer viable. I'm volunteering to go to mars.
I'm excited that we will finally get to see a worse Ben Affleck movie than Gigli.
@ToryPerham he's a terrible actor people seem to forget about the movie gigli lol Torrance u know better!
Ben Affleck as the new Batman? SERIOUSLY?? Hopefully he's as good as his movie Gigli and Jenny on the Block cameos... Ha.
Better hurry and make your Gigli jokes while it still holds the place as the worst movie staring Ben Affleck. #Batfleck
Maybe they saw a movie made after 2003. RT @benshapiro: "Gigli? Reindeer Games? Jersey Girl? Affleck's our man!" -- a Hollywood executive
Quit shitting on Ben Affleck. Gigli was a great movie...
Anyone upset about Ben Affleck being Batman hasnt watched a little movie called Gigli.
SPOILER ALERT: In the next movie, Batman defeats Superman by exposing him to Gigli
My favorite was Gigli RT @JustinMcElroy: Reminder that you liked Ben Affleck in basically every movie he's been in.
Drunken movie studio executive: "You know what the Batman franchise needs? More 'Gigli'. Get Ben Affleck on the phone."
" @metllord: @johnnybeefstew Gigli was a pretty great movie." The Town makes up for EVERYTHING alright
I'm assuming the plot for the new superman/batman movie is that they team up to go back in time and prevent the movie Gigli from happening
I, for one, am excited for the Batman/Superman/Gigli crossover movie.
You guys know that the new Batman movie is a sequel to Gigli, right?
@MarsJLover gigli their movie together
Fighting Gigli for his worst movie ever RT @tydigga1 And ya going to stop white washing Daredevil. That film was epic trash.
I need to think a "all the movies are the same movie" with Gigli, Daredevil, Batman and Good Will Hunting
Gigli lol,its a carrier mistake for him ;), ok for all the movie mentioned above. ..but for a super hero movie as batman...he's a bit light.
Don't worry Batman fans: If Ben Affleck brings the same solid performance that he did in "Gigli", this new movie will be great!
This next Batman movie will either be an academy award winning film or another Gigli.
so upset. This is the same person who was in the movie gigli Then there are others that I don't bother listing because we all what (cont)
Suicide Kings + Chasing Amy + There's Something About Mary + the depth of a Disney Channel movie - budget - plot = Gigli. #BatmanBenResearch
All those who dissed Gigli though. I liked the movie. At least it was better than reading 50 Shades of Grey
If you go back further, you find Jersey Girl, Surviving Christmas, Gigli, and the movie everyone has been bringing up: Daredevil.
Don't underestimate #Batman being played by Ben Affleck ..it could be the best movie ever made! At least better than Gigli?
You can't just forget what Ben Affleck did on Gigli and go watch the new Batman movie like nothing happened.
@Yasirio he still tried to turn a lesbo slut in a movie. And then gigli lol can't say he hasn't worked. Just some shit stains in his résumé
I think Argo to that new Batman movie cause Armegeddon Gigli excited to Hes Just Not That Into You it. #3outof4
Ben Affleck also played another superhero in Larry Gigli whose power was to destroy a movie single handedly,
"This is a bad movie. The worst movie. Want to watch Gigli next week?" @FringeFocus
What if the whole movie is Batman hunting down the people who greenlit Gigli? #Batman
I can't recall any Ben Affleck movie that has managed not to flop since #Gigli
Thanks Hollywood for ruining batman all over again don't think we haven't forgotten about that terrible movie gigli
@AnAndyPaul @JackPendarvis sorry this sarcastic comment doesnt make sense because every Ben Affleck movie is great and that includes Gigli
I think J.Lo wanted to ruin his career on purpose. That Gigli movie seemed intentionally awful.
Anyone doubting Affleck should watch a movie he was in called 'Gigli.' It was awesome but got NO hype.
He going to fuck up the whole movie hello did anyone see daredevil and Gigli smh ! #BetterBatmanThanBenAffleck
In the new Batman movie ... Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) is not afraid of bats, but rather a DVD of "Gigli"
Yes, I did turn down the new Batman movie today but I was nice enough to give them Ben's number. He'll do anything. Remember Gigli?
Affleck is already making suggestions for batman vs superman. Wants jlo to play batgirl. Also wants to rename movie, Gigli 2
@CMPunk Have the movie goers seen Chris Evans' resume? He was the star in Not Another Teen Movie. They can forgive Affleck for Gigli
Now we need J. Lo to be cast in the Superman/Batman movie too. It's DC Comics meets Gigli.
I hope the new Batman and Superman Movie bombs worse than GIGLI
The reason people think Gigli is Ben Affleck's worst movie is because no one saw Reindeer Games.
@AlexIsCool69 lol i was just telling you, he poops out of his chin and was in Gigli, he should play a guy drinking coffee in the movie
In an effort to make a shittier movie than #Gigli, #BenAffleck has signed on to be the new Batman.
I'm super excited for this new Gigli/Superman movie! #BetterBatmanThanBenAffleck
My interest level for this new Batman movie has plummeted to Gigli levels. #Batman
Ben Affleck weirded me out first in that movie Gigli. And he still does to this day. I can't have Batman weirding me out.
Argo RT @G_Polk336: Was dogma successful? RT @DatGirl_ICEY: Gigli RT @iSlickEmDown: Name a successful movie starring Ben Affleck....
#BenAffleck star of the movie Gigli will play Batman. Kevin Smith is said to be crushed.
actually, the Batman/Superman movie starring Ben Affleck can't be any worse than Man of Steel nor Gigli.
Will everyone stop being upset about Ben Affleck being Batman in the new Superman movie?! I mean.. HAVE YOU NOT SEEN 'GIGLI'?! MASTERPIECE!!
@JRehling I wonder if I am going to cry at this film like I did at Gigli. (Or whatever the name of that movie was)
Ben affleck made gigli, the worst movie ever made. Now they wanna make him batman?!? Off with his head!
Ben never got a break after doing that movie #Gigli. The Man has won Academy Awards MAN!
So the trick is to make a couple of good movies and people will forget that Ben Affleck was in Gigli. Worst movie ever
"Criminals are a cowardly and superstitious lot. So was I when I agreed to be in Gigli." CUT!!! "hahah this batman movie blooper reel rules"
Ben #Afflec the new #Batman?How about JLo as #Catwoman, Justin #Bieber as Robin and the movie should be called Gigli 2 Enough said! #snyder
We’ll be seeing the new #batman movie in the $5 DVD bin at Walmart soon as the movie is made, along with #gigli.
I swear though, if Zack Snyder mentions GIGLI in a positive note in any damn interview, I'm not going to see his movie. #batman #BenAffleck
Affleck will never do a better superhero movie than Gigli.
'The Batman Superman movie is going to be amazing!' Said people who liked Gigli.
Who's playing the villain? The movie Gigli?
" @SWOOPE_RM777: DareDevil wasnt just a wack movie, the acting from sir Ben was wack... Not to mention Gigli" lol
Not happy that Ben Affleck is the new Batman. Anyone who stars in a movie as bad as Gigli doesn't deserve to play the best superhero ever
Ben Affleck will now be the only actor in history to have credits for both a Batman movie and Gigli on his movie résumé
DareDevil wasnt just a wack movie, the acting from sir Ben was wack... Not to mention Gigli
--> RT@Moussa_G: You make a movie like Gigli and you should be forever blocked from getting roles like Batman
after gigli... ben afleck should never be given another role... except that last hostage movie he did, he was aight
Christian bale did American psycho, the machinist, the fighter. Affleck has one great movie in the town. Then he has gigli.....
"Affleck was in Gigli. This will suck." Yes well... Bale was in Shaft. So please shut the fuck up and wait for the damn movie.
Horrible Bosses RT @blowticious: Gigli and Dark Water RT @p_cal: What was the worst movie you ever saw?
Don't think Ben Affleck has had this much infamy since the movie "Gigli"
HAHAHA Gigli is trending. I swear that movie was just an excuse for the director to film good angles of Jennifer Lopez's ass.
So, I heard Ben Affleck is playing Batman in the next Superman movie. I hope we get to see a repeat performance of Gigli.
Now if we can get J-Lo to be Batman's love interest in the upcoming movie we'll have cinematic gold on our hands. #neverforget #gigli
@Illusion0fLife remake Gigli with batman & Catwoman as ben/jen roles with the movie Daredevil as th autistic kid. & now I cant stop laughing
I'm really excited about Ben Affleck playing Batman because I think it will soon be my new favourite movie over Gigli and Reindeer Games.
Ben Affleck? As Batman? You won't make an Aquaman movie, but you'll cast Gigli as the Caped Crusader? #holybadcastingdecisionsbatman
movie watchers cant forget lol RT @FOXALOT_Will: People still holding onto Gigli performance lol ShawnaWTF @Kim_Nain @BenAffleck
Terrible actor choice @wbpictures! Wasn't Daredevil, Gigli, hell any Affleck movie proof of that? What a way to ruin Batman.
There you have it ladies & gentlemen....An actor who was the lead in the movie Gigli...got cast as Batman pic.twitter.com/8pGgMjQPsA
you know,seeing as the "inspiration" for the superman/batman movie is the dark knight returns i can warm up to the idea of gigli in the cowl
Ben Affleck will play Batman in the new Man of Steel movie. I guess the director didn't see Daredevil. Or Gigli. It's ok, I didn't either.
Zack Snyder must be the most hated man in America right now...TF u put Ben "gigli" "dare devil" Affleck as Barman in your Man of Steel movie
Things the world doesn't need: another batman movie in the next decade. Especially with the guy from Gigli and Daredevil.
Lol that Michael Keaton, Daredevil, and Gigli are all trending. Daredevil was the first (of many!) movie my kid sis ever walked out on.
Ben Affleck is the new Batman? All that comes to mind is that horrible movie Gigli.so bad smh
Why do I get the feeling the new #Batman movie is going to be the Gigli of superhero movies?? #Batfleck
What the hell has Ben Affleck done to warrant his role as Batman? The movie 'Gigli' should automatically eliminate him from important roles
Considering Argo was an awesome movie I think Ben Affleck has come a long way since Gigli, so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt
You will never be forgiven for that crap of a movie you call Gigli, Ben Affleck! Please don't screw… http://instagram.com/p/dVonZ_JZ4J/ 
If you're going to make a Ben Affleck movie trend, make it Dazed and Confused. No need to remind people that Gigli is a thing.
@ThatLawyerGuy So @BenAffleck is playing Batman in the next #ManOfSteel movie. This has #Gigli written all over it. :/
So Ben Affleck is the new Batman in the 'Man of Steel' sequel? Uhh... If we wanted another Gigli movie, we would have said so.
Ben Affleck was Daredevil... But he also made Argo... Gigli... But the Town. He should make another bad movie first to cleanse his palate.
And, I thought anyone involved with the film 'Gigli' was banned from being in a superhero movie.
We can only assume it was Affleck's role in Gigli that landed him as Batman. It certainly wasn't that terrible Daredevil movie.
I think I'll skip the Batman/Superman movie & just rent Gigli instead, if I want to see Ben Affleck at his best.
Casting of Ben Affleck as Dark Knight in new #supermanvsbatman movie makes me a little Gigli inside, but I could Argo with this choice.
The universe balances itself out: We get Batman and Superman together in a movie, but it has star the guy from Gigli.
"Gigli is a phenomenal movie, I can't believe I left it at home" -someone in this apartment that isn't me :(
Ben Affleck in Gigli, let it go already people. It's a movie and Batman ain't real y'all.
I haven't taken Ben Afleck seriously in a movie since Gigli.
That movie was misunderstood @ItsMarisaRoss: Argo was dope yes but so soon we forget Gigli?"
Argo RT @pjhoody: The Town was a cold movie though. But, Gigli.
I'm really disappointed by the number of people in my timeline who can make Gigli jokes, because that means some of you WATCHED THAT MOVIE.
Good Will Hunting. But Gigli VOIDS ALL THAT RT @ThatPersianGuy: Argo, The Town. RT @PoloTheGawd: Name a good Ben Affleck movie. No troll
The good news is - Ben Affleck already has a "worst movie ever" under his belt thanks to Gigli - so he prolly won't want another.
What if Jennifer Lopez plays Catwoman and this movie is just Gigli with more leather
What's the worst movie ever? — Gigli! GAWD!! http://ask.fm/a/61d9a9oj 
When you think about it, the only real problem with Gigli was the name*. *contents of the movie, excepting the Walken/Pacino cameos.
Gigli RT @SoloChills: Pootie Tang RT @illerthanthou The Fifth Element. RT @HUMonTHESE: Wild Wild West RT @thaG5: Greatest movie of all time?
Alien Vs Predator isn't that bad of a movie. I don't know why people treat it like it's the Gigli of sci fi films

I have yet to meet a person whose favorite movie is 'Gigli', but I hope to meet them one day and give them a hug.
If @timewarnercable was a movie, it would be Gigli 2: Electric Bugaloo. It's that bad #nowifi

Gigli, a movie with Ben Affleck & Jennifer Lopez>>>> #GorgeousPeople
Guys, I'm super excited for the Jobs biopic, because Kutcher isn't a douche, Jobs wasn't an asshole, and Gigli was the best movie ever.
I thought Gigli was a fun movie to watch, actually enjoyed it #confessyourunpopularopinion
Gigli is not a terrible movie... It's not good either ~ it's just mediocre. #ConfessYourUnpopularOpinion

There were enough people who saw Gigli to determine it's the worst movie ever? Also, how is this piece so long? http://thebea.st/1cfKnfm 
So it was 10 years ago today that "Gigli" was released. What's your pick for worst movie EVER?
Am I like the only one who didn't think Gigli was that bad of a movie. I thought it was pretty funny! #bennifer #worstmovieever
I'm launching a new study to determine what percentage of people who've called Gigli "the worst movie ever made" have actually SEEN it.

Sad that we can't make fun of Pearl Harbor or Glitter or Gigli or Showgirls or any shitty movie anymore. Can't risk losing cinema.
Things I respect more than the #Bachelorette shows: smallpox, Anthony Weiner, the movie "Gigli", people who say "amazeballs", and Oklahoma.
Gigli is the BEST movie
"White House Down" is the worst movie since Gigli......June 28th, RIP the directors career #OlympusHasFallenRules
@heatherjs Still a better movie than Gigli
So was Gigli RT @JustinRPro: Precious was an easier movie to watch than this #Rangers offense.
I could have picked, like, Gigli. But bad movies that people actually watch? American Beauty. @_a__w_ re "worst movie" choice
What if Gigli is actually a great movie and we only think it's bad because one critic said so and no one else ever went to see it
@katchoww well yeah Argo is fantastic. Gigli is an atrocity though. Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.
@FFRittle like this ? MT“ @BlaineGabbert: My favourite movie is Gigli #Jaguar #JacksonvilleZoo pic.twitter.com/SoJEvXHF10
Just when I thought Gigli was the worst movie ever, I've found a pair far far worse. Will never get sleep now.
Finally got to #Sharknado on the DVR. I'd say it was the worst movie ever...had I not seen Gigli...
I'd rather watch the movie Gigli a hundred times in a row then ever have an AskFm account #StopAskFm

Abolishing the Senate because of Liz Cheney makes about as much sense as banning movie theaters because of "Gigli".
@ryansongalia If you've never written or directed or acted in a film, you can't say that Gigli was a horrible movie.
Lets take a minute to appreciate that we live in a land where we give ppl who star in a movie like Gigli a second chance #Amercia
#ZimmermanTipLine Gave the movie Gigli two thumbs up.
He paid full price for a ticket to the movie Gigli in the theater then bought the DVD #ZimmermanTipLine
Is Gigli the most homophobic and ignorant movie of all-time? MAYBE!
My verdict (you see what I did there) on #SharkNado is: #GUILTY of being the worst movie ever made. Sorry @Gigli

Myself and a bunch of movie buffs should make a fan video to get Martin Brest to make a comeback. We can blame JLo for Gigli. *wink wink*

Jersey Girl got such a bad rap cause of Gigli, but it was really unwarranted. It's a nice little movie.
@IvanBrandon congrats! Can't wait to see the movie, unless it's Gigli 2

Jersey girl again tonite .fall in love a little bit more every time with@BenAffleck in this movie. Wtf I even enjoyed gigli today.
Can't believe I left it this long to watch Argo. Ben Affleck, I forgive you for every bad movie you ever made. Apart from Gigli obviously...
Limitless is on TV tonight. I'm hard pushed to think of a worse movie. I'd rather watch Gigli. I'd rather watch Catwoman!

#MoreViewersThanMSNBC A movie marathon featuring Baby Geniuses, Gigli, Freddy Got Fingered and Pluto Nash.
Watching "Gigli" lol this movie

I'd heard the Pact was a good movie. Should have asked what those people thought of films like Gigli and Epic Movie before taking advice.
Okay, it's now been ten fucking years since Martin Brest has made a movie. Can we finally just admit that GIGLI was not *that* bad?
Someone tweeted that #Hangover3 is the worst movie ever. Really? #RoboCop3, #Gigli #Waterworld, #Bloodrayne, #ChasingPapi? #DontThinkSo
Good movie. Argo gets a 4.5 out of 5 from me. Who knew Ben Halffleck had some skills after all. Remember Gigli? ::cough::cough::
The Miami Heat's favorite movie: Gigli.
"Her butt reminds me of that #JLo movie, jiggly....you mean gigli?" - best quote of the night
Movies I regret watching: #Gigli. A flat, lifeless lump of a movie.
@jyarow @TheStalwart @markgurman Worse than Movie 42? Worse than Gigli? Worse than Howard the Duck? Worse than Jack & Jill?
Hey @pawleenc I still can't believe you bought #gigli on DVD. You must really like that movie.
Only after 30 minutes into #hangover3 I already feel like this is the worst movie ever made. Worse than #gigli.

@icedandfrozen and gigli, epic fail movie of jlo and her guy
@ImDavidAbrams I haven't seen Revenge, but Gigli is a movie that lives up to its hype. It was weird and embarrassing and unwatchable.
@kwelch_ oh when it comes to embarrassing movies, Ben made fun of his movie Gigli, and it was one of the loudest cheers of the show :-P
Lmao no. RT @iluvlingerie: Gigli RT @MoDroJoJo Human Centipede RT @vohandas What's a good movie to watch? Any recommendations ?
