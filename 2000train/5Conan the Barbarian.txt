Now watching Conan the Barbarian. Apparently at 2-3 weeks old Conan the Destroyer was my very first movie in a theater at Redondo Beach.
Worst movie you saw at the cinemas? Mine was Conan the Barbarian in 3D
So I really enjoyed Conan the Barbarian, but I'm going to need a supercut or a gif set of all the goofy faces Ahnold makes during the movie.
Also movie night with @anjardine and Conan the Barbarian helps with most things in life. We should really have our own commentary show.

@wizdom4you it's as simple as a quote from the movie "Conan the Barbarian", when asked what were the rules of War, Conan replied...
@SkylerBarwell RoboCop, Conan the Barbarian (Adventurer), Police Academy, Back to the Future, Bill & Ted, no movie was without a cartoon.
Conan the Barbarian is a very cool, very funny movie. Arnie hits a camel. Gets schooled on Gods by the Mongolian warrior.
It's like they forgot how to make a good Conan movie after Conan the Barbarian.

The movie Troy (2004) is like "What if the people who made the old Conan the Barbarian had more money to make an epic?" Still cheesy.

Watching the latest #movie, #Conan - The Barbarian. My kind of movies #medieval, all swords and arrows!
to encounter some truly baffling, conflicted ideas about race, culture, and history, any Conan the Barbarian movie is a great place to start
Ati *conan the barbarian* ..io ni movie reu kana ni mai ma ngui..nie no njikire CNN Mangai
First time seeing Conan the Barbarian. Dude knocks a camel out, why was that not its movie poster!? I woulda gone and seen it WAY sooner

If you haven't watched a movie on our new HD screen yet, you're missing out! Catch "Conan the Barbarian" during your Saturday workout!
The rock look gay af on this new Hercules movie. Ass looking more like conan the barbarian and shit
@kelleajo Also! In the original Conan The Barbarian movie, a camel startles Conan, and he knocks it out. However..that wasn't scripted.
Having troubles sleeping, usually the Conan the barbarian or a zombie movie is my go to. what's your favorite movies?
Which movie is better? Conan the Barbarian Conan the Destroyer
[P] CONAN THE BARBARIAN is on. This movie is the Milius-est.
Holy shit, Conan The Barbarian would make for one helluva Acid Movie Like, one would likely discover new emotions haha #Schwarzenegger
Well, I do like multi-tasking. Me doin' the laundry while watching that bloody Conan The Barbarian movie. :D
Conan the Barbarian!!! Yes sir!!! Great movie!
has there ever been as big a gap in quality between a movie and its sequel as Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer
Conan the Barbarian might technically be a better movie...but Destroyer has Grace Jones. I mean c'mon.
Conan the Barbarian is on. If a movie is good enough to become my twitter game, you know it's awesome.
Conan the Barbarian is still an awesome fucking movie.
@CaptainKyle1 I should specify it's the movie "Conan the barbarian" not the late show host
Movie called Conan the Barbarian on with this guy named Arnold. I expect an essay on why its a billion times better than movies today.
I'm hype because Conan the Barbarian is on and my wife says she hates this movie. Who the hell did I marry?

Conan the Barbarian is a really weird movie.
Conan the Barbarian is such a classic movie. Watching me some old Arnold movies before going to the gym just hits the spot! #motivation
I feel like Conan The Barbarian (1982) doesn't get talked about enough. This is a the best looking comic book movie.
How did I miss the Conan the barbarian remake?! I loved tht movie! It was the soul reason I got a ferret in 7th grade!!!

Watching original Conan The Barbarian. Sick movie. James Earl Jones just turned into a snake watching an orgy.
Just like how Jason Mamoa's Conan the Barbarian movie sucked so bad that Arnold ended up being brought back.
Just saw Conan The Barbarian. The movie's integrity pretty much dies with Ron Pearlman at the start.
There has never been a score in a fantasy movie that has been as complex, nuanced and lush as Conan the Barbarian's-
But a movie you don't hear this as often is Conan the Barbarian, another movie I feel strongly about

1) write Conan the Barbarian movie as an allegory for smashing big government 2) make more money than I've ever seen 3) die relatively young

Awesome movie night at the well appointed BWE theatre. Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood" and the extended cut of "Conan the Barbarian" :)
Movie marathon! ★ Conan the Barbarian — https://path.com/p/6vB16 
The Rock Hercules beats that other shitty Hercules movie trailer by a lot. Scores highly on the Conan-the-Barbarian-Animal-Punch-O-Meter.
Finally got CONAN THE BARBARIAN on Blu-ray, the commentary from @Schwarzenegger & director John Milius is just as entertaining as the movie!
#80sMovies ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER’s first Terminator movie was shown in 1984. His breakthrough role was in Conan the Barbarian in 1982
It's not terribly trendy to say that your favourite movie soundtrack is Conan The Barbarian, is it? But it's PHENOMENAL!
Just watched a few minutes of the remake of Conan The Barbarian. Absolutely killed an awesome movie. Worst remake of a movie, ever. Wtf.
Hercules in New York & Pumping Iron appeal to some, but Schwarzenegger wasn't in a MOVIE till Conan the Barbarian

@Gondoramos Can you guys review the original 1982 "Conan The Barbarian" with Arnold? That, to me, is the ultimate "Man movie".
Movies like commando,Predator,Terminator movie series,Conan the barbarian....awesome stuff http://instagram.com/p/l-xKS0wK-e/ 
The Rock can do this Hercules movie but no way in hell it can come close to Arnold's Conan the Barbarian.
. @TheRock's new movie looks more like Conan the Barbarian than Hercules. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JZhGYrgCPg&feature=youtube_gdata_player …
I think the ROCK would be an EXCELLENT choice to portray Conan the Barbarian, Jason Mamoa was not right for the part, the movie sucked.
@TweetLocke I that was Conan The Barbarian. That movie was made several years ago. I thought it was pretty good.
