Django Unchained was an awesome ass movie. If anything Quentin made the perfect slave revenge movie that hit on slavery on a surface level.
Lots of Tarantino's comments come from a place of passion. Like when he said Django Unchained was the definitive movie about slavery. lol
@shadowandact Tarantino still gets the side eye from me. He swore "Django Unchained" was going to be the definitive movie abt slavery...
