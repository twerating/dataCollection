@mollysoda actually the movie is Casino Royale -- Peter plays James Bond tho which is funny even in theory
Movie: Spectre. Rating: 3/5. One time watch. Casino Royale remains best Daniel Craig movie. Skyfall next. Quantum of Solace worst.

casino royale movie: good. casino royale book: better. next is obviously quantum of solace for my bond-a-thon.
Read Casino Royale this past summer and finally got to watch the movie. Both were good, although I liked the book better.
Okay, screw the haters - Spectre gave me absolutely everything I wanted from a Bond movie. Plus, the best theme song since Casino Royale.
I'm attempting to watch Casino Royale for what I'm sure is probably the 10th time. I can never follow this movie. And it's long af.
@Pete_hoff Everyone knows Casino Royale is the first Bond movie.
@universalshow 1) the actress Eva Green (she was in the new Casino Royale Bond movie) & 2) anyone else named Eva Green?

People who think casino royale is a great bond movie have little understanding of bond and unreasonable expectations of Daniel Craig
So, here's a thought: 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is the best Bond movie since 'Casino Royale'
Casino Royale (2006) is such a great movie

Okay but the casino royale opening is the realest shit like oh my god this movie
“Casino Royale” is the best James Bond movie in the franchise’s history. Fight me.

Casino Royale is on. No, not that one. The 1967 version. I told y’all my parents raised me right. This movie was so well done. An OG parody!
Casino Royale remains the best Bond movie done by Craig. Skyfall and Spectre just don't even meet the 50% bar left by Casino Royale.

"Casino Royale" might be my favorite Bond; Daniel Craig did that movie right.
@timwagner66 It was an ok movie, not the best 007 but you see a glimpse of the DB10. Casino Royale is still the best

@mattogborn Casino Royale a knockout movie, and v poor form that no director has found the mesmerising Eva Green a decent part since
@gengarsmyth Casino Royale is a great movie.
Wow. Spectre was awesome. Not quite Casino Royale, probably not Skyfall either, but a great movie nonetheless. #SPECTRE
@kenlowery No movie's action scenes look good next to CASINO ROYALE so QoS has some problems there.
Casino Royale is the best Bond movie and it makes me sad that somebody finds it possible to disagree

Casino Royale will forever be the best Bond movie
007: Spectre is a great movie. Yet, when compared to Casino Royale or Skyfall it is just an ok movie.
Rewatched Casino Royale because it was the best Bond movie ever and man, I have missed it.
My view on #SPECTRE : Decent movie, worth watching, but not a patch on Craig's best (Casino Royale) - one too many cringe moments!

I rewatched Casino Royale last night bc Twitter made me and it's like... kinda dumb that a Bond movie makes me feel that many emotions.
Gosh dang Skyfall is such a good movie. Not quite as good as Casino Royale imo, but still really REALLY good

Doubt Spectre is as good as Casino Royale... That was such a great Bond movie
Damn, Casino Royale was a fantastic movie!
In the '67 Casino Royale movie, Woody Allan plays Bond's nephew Jimmy Bond, who basically feels like, well, its Woody Allen.
Casino Royale is better than any Bourne movie, and so is Goldfinger @chriswashere321
Worst James Bond movie? Casino Royale. Haha just kidding that movie is perfect. #MovieFightsLive @screenjunkies
Not to give too much away...This movie is kind of joining the dots since casino royale. Lea Seydoux...wonderful!!! #SpectreWithPIX

It goes Casino Royale, Skyfall, Spectre then QOS for me. Enjoyed the movie though!
Newt Gingrich's opinions are so repulsive... He thinks Spectre is Daniel Craig's best Bond movie! Casino Royale? Skyfall?
I want another gritty down to earth James Bond movie again. Like casino Royale was. I'm tired of bond always being a damn superhero. Smfh

In Denmark, Casino Royale is a movie about an unlucky banker foiled at every turn willing to do whatever it takes to repay his clients
No bond movie comes close to casino royale
@wendeego @br1anwuzhere it's a shame bc Casino Royale and Skyfall were great IMO but the second movie was eh and this one seems eh too
spectre is a great movie, it doesnt deserve some of the reviews its been getting. being the sequel to skyfall and casino royale is tough
Just saw #SPECTRE. Solid Bond movie overall. Definitely better than quant of solace but not as good as skyfall or casino royale
James bond ki new movie average hai.. Skyfall ka script strong tha. Casino Royale bhi achi thie.
Now that Daniel Craig is about to be done as 007, what was his best bond movie? Was it Casino Royale or Skyfall?
Rewatching Casino Royale now. 15 mins in and it's already a better movie than all of SPECTRE.

rewatching Casino Royale, I love how un-action-movie it is. the best scenes are the conversation scenes, and there actually are some.
Well behaved kids in the movie theatre are appreciated, but I gotta ask- were you even born when Casino Royale came out?

Casino Royale isn't just the best James Bond movie ever. It's one of the best action films of ALL TIME.
Spectre was a fun movie, but it did not have a single scene as good as this one from Casino Royale. #007 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S39paDGZ0Ew …
Overall? not bad for a Bond movie, trying to stay true to the mood set from casino royale, dark gritty, violent Bond.. #Spectre007
Casino Royale was not the best movie if you like guys beating other men your sure not right in the head.
My confession of the day is I really like the soundtrack to Casino Royale, not the 2006 movie, the 1967 movie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhmZULZXxWc …
@Aquatium yes they are both similar. Anyway quite far behind Casino Royale (best JB movie ever) and Skyfall
Spectre was a dud. But then, I didn't like Skyfall either. But Spectre was actually worse. Casino Royale remains my fave Craig Bond movie.

@007hertzrumble This movie or variation of should have been done after Casino Royale, and your right we can skip the comic book mythology.
Dah boleh marathon james bond movie start dari casino royale sampai ke spectre sbb semua berkait rapat.
Not sure of most things in life, but I'm 100% positive that Casino Royale is the best Bond movie.
Skyfall > Casino Royale > Spectre > Quantum of Solace Skyfall set the bar too high, and Spectre felt like a forced movie.
Bout to watch this James Bond movie. No context. Thought James Gandolfini(rip) was the villain in casino royale until yesterday. Here we go.
Bar "Casino Royale" Craig has made the three worst bond movie ever. Yes including the invisible car one.
Spectre is a decent Bond movie, but probably the 3rd best Daniel Craig film, behind Skyfall and Casino Royale.
@Amazing_EU my favorite bond movie is Licence to Kill, my favortie graig one is casino royale ofc.

#SPECTRE isn't half the movie Casino Royale is. Is the #JamesBond brand tired?
@MattTomerlin I think every first new bond movie is the best they made. Dr. No, Live and Let Die, Living Daylights, Goldeneye, Casino Royale
@mcmellenclapp Haha, and yet. I absolutely loved Casino Royale but almost walked out of the movie theater during Skyfall.

Many actually think Casino Royale is a better movie.
OKAY CASINO ROYALE: i felt the end was really weak and it kinda retroactively made me feel the movie is weak, but I think up until like the
@MLHamm11 nah, I mean, I could see it being a stand alone movie, but put it in a series with Casino Royale and Skyfall? I didn't think it

@TheRochaSays It wasn't on that Skyfall or Casino Royale level, but I really enjoyed it. Fun movie
#Spectre: It's everything you want in a Bond movie. Wraps up story threads that have been hanging since Casino Royale.
Arguably the best James Bond movie ever, Casino Royale is reviewed here by @jumpcutjakob and he's spot on IMO. https://twitter.com/jumpcutUK/status/663785694725349376 …

Spectre is the first Bond movie I've seen since eh.. I do not know. I can't even remember watching Casino Royale - time to get some blurays
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/19IMQq8jeSQ?a  Casino Royale - Movie Review
@Saj51Khan @DangerEnPassant @john_cade think Craig closest to the novels & Casino Royale my fave movie. Spy Who Loved Me second.
I don't think SPECTRE is the worst Craig Bond movie...think Quantum was far worse and a waste. Skyfall and Casino Royale were better.
Watched 007 Spectre. Another let down. Only Casino Royale in the Craig Era is the movie that really worth it.

Trying to watch the 1967 Casino Royale and am not sure if the NyQuil has already kicked in or if this movie is really that disjointed. Both?
Spectre dangerously close to rotten status on RT. I've not seen the movie yet but I know they will never top Casino Royale. Not now not ever
After seeing Spectre, I'm really losing faith we'll ever see a 007 movie as good as Casino Royale again.
Spectre wasn't a great movie. It was a very Bond movie but it wasn't the best of Craig's run. Money's still on Skyfall. Casino Royale, even.
#Spectre007 was excellent. 2nd best Daniel Craig Bond movie behind Casino Royale. #Bond
Dame Judi Dench is absolutely brilliant as M, just one of the awesome elements of an already great movie. — watching Casino Royale
i've said it before and i'll say it again. skyfall had the best song but casino royale was the best movie.
@Disko09 it can go either way .. Casino Royale was a great movie though.
The new @007 movie just makes me want to watch Casino Royale again.
Gonna say it. Casino Royale is boring. Poker is a boring scenario to build a spy movie and/or book around.
Spectre is a great movie, but Casino Royale remains my favorite. #Spectre #JamesBond
Casino Royale was a hell of a movie. A slow burner, a mystery with intermittent, hard hitting action. Damn good film #SPECTRE #Spectre007 BS
Spectre was really good but I still think Casino Royale is my favorite Craig Bond movie
New Bond movie is way overhyped.So cliche and bland.Definitely not up to par with Casino Royale or Skyfall. #SPECTRE pic.twitter.com/EnzAkmGfEl
In Amsterdam the movie is called CASINO ROYALE WITH CHEESE #FakeJamesBondFacts
Watching Casino Royale... what a movie!
#FakeJamesBondFacts a rough draft of the 1st Bond movie had him sharing a 1/4 lb-er w/Cheese in Paris w/Jules. "Casino Royale with Cheese"
I did like Spectre but Casino Royale is still my favorite Daniel Craig Bond movie. It blew me away when I first saw it. Skyfall a close 2nd.

I have to say Spectre was probably Daniel Craig's best Bond movie after Casino Royale...
Casino Royale is the best Bond movie, hands down
So SPECTRE is the best Bond movie since CASINO ROYALE. The plot was meh but the acting and action scenes drove the film.
Skyfall is still the best Bond movie for me among the 4 portrayed by Daniel Craig. Casino Royale is just as good too.
I'm sorry to this guy who I got a picture taken with but when you list Casino Royale as your number one pick. You have bad movie picks
@mirrorxboy @leaannnee I personally think it's a great movie. On par with the likes of Casino Royale and Skyfall (Quantum is my weak one)
The new #Bond movie is terrible. It is like someone put Casino Royale & Skyfall in a blender. Nothing new or compelling. #disappointment
@NigelBahadur @sad_rave I have so much love for Casino Royale also, must have seen that movie like 10 times
Just watched Spectre, it was good James Bond movie.. But still, Casino Royale is still the best for me
Spectre is shockingly bad. Amazing how they made Casino Royale so awesome and then every movie got exponentially worse. DB10 though
Yo. SPECTRE was great. It's a bond movie through and through. Nothing will ever touch Casino Royale, but this was tons of fun.
@gabrielhardman Casino Royale is the best Daniel Craig Bond-era movie. Ever.
@DrGhett0Batman @MichaelTweaton Casino Royale, what a movie
Movie Review! Spectre. Not a bad 007 movie. Had some good actions sequences. Casino Royale is still my favorite Daniel Craig bond film tho.
Casino Royale is still the best bond movie ever in my opinion. Spectre was awesome though
Saw Spectre tonight. Fantastic Bond movie. Not as great as Skyfall or Casino Royale, but still a lot of fun.
Movie wasn't the greatest....skyfall, casino royale, and quantum solace were far superior than this shid https://twitter.com/forbes/status/663214866728165377 …
I had no fingernails left by the end of #Spectre. Chewed nails = successful movie. Casino Royale still the best, but Spectre holds up.
i keep remembering Ball Whipping and dying. casino royale is such a weird movie
1) Casino Royale, 2) Spectre, 3) Skyfall, 4) a movie project made by 5th graders, 5) Keeping up w/ the Kardashians, 6) Quantum of Solace
Casino Royale is still my favorite Craig Bond movie. And Roger Moore, my favorite Bond. <3
Casino Royale is still the best Bond movie ever made, and one of the best action movies ever. Bar none.
the only bond movie I've seen is casino royale 2006 for obvious reasons
My Daniel Craig 007 movie ranking. Casino Royale > Spectre = Skyfall > Quantum of Solace.
Casino Royale really the best movie ever
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/nq65SQlXdQ8?a  Casino Royale 2006 Movie Review
Enjoyed Spectre but they wasted Christoph Waltz as a villain. Casino Royale is still the best James Bond movie. #Spectre007
New Bond movie: not as good as Casino Royale or Spectre, but still damn good!
Lol but Craig IS the best Bond I've seen. And I've seen every single Bond movie. Even the original Casino Royale.
SPECTRE is the best 007 movie since Casino Royale. Pay no mind to bad reviews, this is better than Skyfall.
Watched Spectre. A good Bond movie. Not as good as Casino Royale, but definitely on par with Skyfall, maybe better
It tied the plot threads from Casino Royale, Skyfall and that other movie nicely.
@jfmfox It's a good movie, not as great as Skyfall or Casino Royale, but overall a good adventure. The opening sequence was AAA+
Haven't seen the newest Bond's movie yet, so.... ★ Casino Royale (with Naomi) — https://path.com/p/1Au9zq 
@RotoPat Casino Royale was better than any Brosnan movie though. Do you remember how awful the late Brosnan movies were?
Oh Spectre was a good movie. A lot more classic Bond-esque, eh. Rank that third for Craig’s Bonds, behind Casino Royale and Skyfall.
My fav James Bond's movie and soundtrack ★ Casino Royale — https://path.com/p/2vWuJk

007's new movie #Spectre is getting average to above-average reviews! Way behind Casino Royale & Skyfall's level!
#Spectre007 Conflicting thoughts. Song unremarkable. Movie not as good as Casino Royale & Skyfall. Actually found myself nodding off once.
New Bond movie, Spectre is pretty awesome, not sure if it beats Casino Royale though pic.twitter.com/DV8d0P0TXD
Watched Spectre. Great movie. Enjoyed it very much. Craig brilliant yet again. Lea Seydoux is so lovely. But Casino Royale was better imo.
@Afifhakimin since 1st movie dah obsessed bui Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall
Casino Royale has the weirdest torture scene for a bond movie. They smack him in the balls with a rope. James Cuck : Casino Bondage
Spectre was...definitely a Bond movie!! I enjoyed it although possibly less than Casino Royale and Skyfall
@Stuffed_Muffin eh didn't care for it much like the movie. Not as good as Casino Royale or Skyfall IMO not quintessential Bond.
It truly is a #MadsMikkelsen movie weekend. showtime playing the Salvation and syfy Casino Royale
Saw Spectre, it was great to go see a movie again, especially something I was excited to see. Good, but Casino Royale & Skyfall were better.
This Casino Royale poker scene might be the dumbest scene in movie history. KQss v 88 v A6 v 57s on Ax4s6s8sAx. Lol okay.
Casino Royale is a stellar cable movie. You can jump in at any scene.
@gabrielhardman another year, another bond movie, and casino royale is still the best.
Best Bond movie since Casino Royale. Loved it! #SPECTRE
Watched the new Bond movie! It was good!! The opening sequence was so aldls though LOL..;;; I still like Casino Royale's op sequence best
Spectre: Not on the level of Casino Royale or Skyfall, but still a very solid Bond movie.
Casino Royale is still the best Craig Bond movie because it knew what it was. Skyfall and Spectre can't quite figure out their tone
Can’t agree more with @Spacekatgal Spectre might not be Casino Royale, but it’s a good Bond movie! Critics were way too harsh
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/dL4kHZvu3Zk?a  Casino Royale - Movie Review
It's not as good as Skyfall or Casino Royale. But the worst Daniel Craig Bond movie is still better that the very best Roger Moore one.

Casino Royale - Movie Review by @Chris_Stuckmann https://youtu.be/19IMQq8jeSQ 
#SPECTRE wasn't great, Casino Royale still the definitive bond movie of the #danielcraig era. Monica Bellucci though, like a fine wine..
Casino Royale still best 007 movie from Daniel Craig era. Not a huge Skyfall fan here, I must say.
@TribeTobias No Bond Movie like Casino Royale!! Imagine why??? pic.twitter.com/MZuMo9r8wL
Just hope it's a good Bond movie, period. That doesn't mean it has to be exactly like, say, Skyfall or Casino Royale.
I've seen every Bond movie and every version of Bond (including the original Casino Royale)... so I'm flexible in my interpretation.
Casino Royale with Daniel Craig really is the best James Bond movie ever
Casino Royale still my favorite James Bond movie
@kpduck it's a good Bond movie! I just really liked Casino Royale
I enjoyed #Spectre just as much as Skyfall. They are both tied for second behind my favorite Bond movie Casino Royale
Casino Royale is such a great movie.

Casino Royale is a 2 hour movie. Tell me why it's taken me almost 5 hours just to watch the first 51mins of it
@SirSquinty CASINO ROYALE is so good that it has makes people forgive the fact that every Craig-Bond movie since hasn't been at that level.
I quite liked Quantum of Solace. It was a good movie, a good sequel to Casino Royale, but a *terrible* Bond film.
I planned to watch Casino Royale (my favorite Bond movie) tonight, but I'm so tired, I don't feel enough strength in myself to it... :/
Best action scene in a Bond? Say yes. Come on it totally is. Casino Royale Movie CLIP - Parkour Chase (2006) HD https://youtu.be/iZxNbAwY_rk 
Casino Royale is by far the best Bond movie
@j_aludino skyfall was good, but martin campbell knows how to make an amazing James bond movie. HE DID GOLDENEYE AND CASINO ROYALE
All the reviews I am seeing are claiming that Casino Royale is the best Bond movie. What planet are these people living on?
Among all of Craig, James Bond Movie, Spectre is the worst. IMO the best one is Casino Royale
Also, based on that review I don't think the reviewer watched a Bond movie prior to Casino Royale.
Casino Royale. Also, I forgot to post Die Another Day last night. Also also, Casino Royale is an awful James Bond movie. Come at me, bro!
Why is Quantum of Solace so disliked? It’s not as good as Casino Royale or Skyfall but it’s not a horrendous movie.

@KevinRashidi if you like sky fall and you like bond you should still see it. It's no Casino Royale, that's for sure. Standard bond movie
Hands down casino royale was the best bond movie of the craig era.
Maaaan Spectre was a good movie. Not as great as Casino Royale or Skyfall, but it was good.

Halfway through Skyfall now... Yeah this ain't even close to Casino Royale's level. This just a pretty good #Bond movie.
@youneedabath Casino Royale is probably my favorite Bond movie. But I also don’t really care for the character of “James Bond,” so ymmv.
#SPECTRE was good last night but Skyfall and Casino Royale still much better. Overall a good Bond movie
Casino Royale still remains the best Bond movie yet

At about 150 minutes, #Spectre is the longest #Bond movie, beating the previous holder, Casino Royale by six minutes. #PVR #007week #Spectre
Spectre is a solid bond movie but the script and weak villains makes it not as good as casino royale or skyfall. #SPECTRE
I believe Casino Royale is still my favorite Daniel Craig movie, I have to rewatch them.
Casino Royale is and always will be the best James Bond movie in my opinion
@SwaggSoTaceTee @BenHanson10 Casino Royale, Skyfall, Dr No, Goldeneye are all better but damn amazing movie
Spectre was pretty good. Not as good as Skyfall or Casino Royale, but still a good movie. Needed a little more action, great story though.
#SPECTRE was a good movie that takes us back to the classic Bond but still not as good as Casino Royale and Skyfall!

@Howie_OT @FutbolIntellect skyfall was an awesome movie but casino royale is far and away the best bond movie I've ever seen
@Devindra also here's what this movie makes me re-realize: CASINO ROYALE is fucking awesome
#Spectre: a cool James Bond movie and forms a nice trio w/ Casino Royale and Skyfall. Writing's On The Wall finally captured my attention.
Dope movie but Casino Royale my all time favorite. @regalmovies #IMAXspectre @ UA King Of Prussia… https://instagram.com/p/9uis7mDSt0/ 
Watched Quantum of Solace last night, and I think the main problem about that movie is the filmmakers were more interested in Casino Royale.
Didn't see Casino Royale or Quantum of Solace when they were in theaters. SkyFall is the only James Bond movie I've seen in theaters.

if you give me and @thelaureno a bottle of wine and the casino royale dvd we can actually laugh thru the entire movie
I’ve never seen it but the best James Bond movie is the 1954 ‘Casino Royale,’ because Peter Lorre is in it.
Casino Royale is way better than I remember. Holy shit. Dare I say better than Goldeneye? Goldeneye being my favorite 007 movie. GOD DAMN.
Casino Royale scene at the Body Worlds exhibit was the first time that actual corpses were shown in a Bond movie. #PVR #007week #Spectre
Casino Royale is the third #Bond movie in which James Bond resigns. #PVR #007week #Spectre
Nothin on the 'ole TV, guess that means I should prep for the new Bond movie. Time for Casino Royale!

@Bond_JamesBond @___0_0_7 in your opinion which has been the best movie in 007 franchise.for me it's a tie between Skyfall and casino royale
Watched my first ever Bond movie all the way through last night. Casino Royale. It was good. Watching Skyfall tonight.
honestly why are movie props so expensive all i want is a CHIP from casino royale there's no need for it to be $5k
For my money, the most *fun* Bond movie to watch is goldenEye, followed by Casino Royale. I could watch either any damned time.
@Danielleri Okay you fix the Brosnan liking by your second favorite movie. Mine behind Casino Royale.
@Danielleri definitely a top 5 bond movie. I think i can only say I liked Casino Royale and Goldfinger more. Maybe Skyfall.
@MovieMantz @aliciamalone @ProfilesSK Favourite Bond movie Casino Royale. Favourite Bond theme song "Nobody does it better"
Casino Royale is still just as fantastic every time I watch it. Gets better even. It's pretty much the perfect BOND movie.
Casino Royale is still my favorite Bond movie so far #007 #PrepforSpectre
ok i can't watch them all but at least i can fill the important gaps so tonites movie nite move is: CASINO ROYALE

@MovieMantz @aliciamalone @ProfilesSK Casino Royale is the best movie starring Bond but From Russia With Love is the best Bond flick
@OhLittleKat Does it? I liked the movie, though... Not as good as Skyfall, but almost as good as Casino Royale... :)
I'd probably consider including CASINO ROYALE in my top 10 action movies. It's comically better than every other Bond movie.
Well, not CASINO ROYALE. That movie rules. That movie is more like a sexy tragedy. The rest, whatever. I'm agnostic.

@thedailybeast At least Casino Royale was good. The rest I barely remember. Still I'd take Casino Royale over any Jason Bourne movie.
Specter getting mediocre reviews is not a good sign. Casino Royale and Skyfall were great. Why is every other bond movie crap (QoS, now S)?
Casino Royale checks every possible box for me when it comes to movie viewing. Top tier work on all fronts. Might be in my top 20 all time
i've seen the ending of casino royale more than the phantom of the opera (mind you, phantom is my favorite movie) aha !
the only great james bond movie was casino royale, he's so boring now.
Skyfall is a fantastic movie! Casino Royale is pretty excellent, too.
Casino Royale is the quintessential Bond movie.
Nearly ten years after it opened, I still feelcomfortable calling CASINO ROYALE the third best Bond movie. Time has been kind to it.

Casino Royale is the best bond movie by far
@epbooke @whereisiannuzzi I think Quantum is much much better watched with Casino Royale. It elevates that movie. So its hard to say.
Personal opinion Spectre was 7/10 movie. Some great action as you'd expect, but didn't really love the story like Casino Royale or Skyfall.
Why Casino Royale (no, not the 1967 one) is actually the greatest James Bond movie ever. http://bit.ly/1WuNvXJ  pic.twitter.com/mdA1AxnGnq
Spectre was no Casino Royale or Skyfall but was still a decent movie #GoodEffort

@DrMonkeybot @MritalkApple123 Quantum of Solace was awful & I liked bits of Skyfall. Casino Royale has been his best movie so far.
@WHMPodcast Wait I've jut realised! it could be the 1960's Casino Royale movie! technically a James bond movie
It's Bond week. I just want to throw it out there that Casino Royale is not only the best Bond movie, but the best Super Hero origin story.

So just watched Casino Royale for the first time. Great movie! Eva Green steals the movie. However, I was not expecting it to be that long.
Casino Royale is prob my favorite movie of all time
Casino Royale is on and I'm pretty sure this is my least favorite Bond movie.

I love Casino Royale so much but there's something about the jazz and darkness of Skyfall that I like slightly more. Such a great movie.
Now watching Casino Royale. Daniel Craig is so young and skinny in this movie. Can't believe this movie is nearly 10 years old.
Watched Casino Royale again earlier. Still a solid 8/10 movie.
Casino Royale is the best Bond movie
Casino Royale is absolutely class!! Best James Bond movie there has ever been #JamesBond
Casino Royale is easily Daniel Craig's best bond movie

When internet is down & movie steaming not an option...Casino Royale DVD is obviously the way to go. Bond 1 Broadband 0.
@bairfanx @elevenafter Casino Royale is a really good movie. Same director (and I think writers!) as Goldeneye.
Spectre (7/10): Good overall as a Bond movie. Started very strongly. Fell short of Casino Royale (9/10) but as good as Skyfall.
Rewatched Quantum of Solace, this movie isn't bad or anything but it certainly didn't live up to the expectations set by Casino Royale.
To this day, Casino Royale is the only Bond movie I’ve ever cared about. Fantastic movie

Disappointed with Spectre Casino Royale was too good, has ruined any Bond movie to come after. #ThoseBlueShorts
Spectre is an unreal movie, definitely up there with Casino Royale, Daniel Craig take a bow! #007 #spectre
Been watching Spectre. Not quite as good as Casino Royale or Skyfall but still a great movie. pic.twitter.com/BQeOWCyhSW
Casino Royale is still my fave Daniel Craig #007 movie, but #SPECTRE does feature cool action and amazing cinematography 3
@B1992H is it really ? I haven't been interested in a Daniel Craig bond movie since casino Royale
I am not sure if it was as good as Casino Royale or Skyfall, but Spectre was a damn good movie! Loved every minute of it.

Casino Royale. Definitely one of the best in the Bond series, possibly a perfect movie.
Have decided to watch Casino Royale tonight to cleanse my Bond palette. Discovered a friend who has never watched a Bond movie. No idea how
Until FURY ROAD, I don't think any movie has had as many amazing action set-pieces as CASINO ROYALE.
My favorite Bond movie yet is Casino Royale hands down.

Casino Royale is by far the best #Bond movie

@dullnixon This Is England: sean - " have you seen daniel Craig in that new James Bond movie?" Gadget - "casino royale?"...
So what's the verdict on the new Bond movie #spectre .....better than Casino Royale or Moonraker? #JamesBond
I hope the new Bond movie is better than that Casino Royale piece of crap. Two hours of watching people play cards. Snore.
#SPECTRE Excellent movie, even better than Casino Royale.Craig and Mendes got this one much better than Skyfall.
Going off Target to say our team loved SPECTRE.An even better Daniel Craig Bond movie than Casino Royale.
Craig is a great actor, great Bond (Casino Royale is my favourite Bond movie) and he deserves SO much more than this. Oh well, rant over :P
And of course from my second favorite movie ever (behind BTTF), Casino Royale.
#spectre is a perfect end for Daniel Craig as Bond. Was it the best Bond movie by him? No. 1) casino royale 2) Skyfall 3) Spectre.
Spectre was really good. Maybe not Casino Royale good, but good. Very slow burning for a Bond movie. I say that as a compliment.
@lizzielh for me didn't have the wow factor of casino royale but still great movie :)

Casino Royale was legit the best bond movie since Goldfinger. Yes 90s fan even better than golden eye. But only barely because the ending
Casino Royale is a top quality movie! Looking forward to seeing Spectre this week too

Okay. Finished Casino Royale. I am suprised I really liked it. Probably the only Bond movie that I will like.
@ArdoOmer I saw Casino Royale when it was out in theaters. I had never sweated so much through a movie until then!
I have never seen a James Bond movie. Changing that now with CASINO ROYALE.
@DMC_Ryan @IGN I thought he's been good, too, but I think it's time for a big change. Casino royale was a fantastic movie!
Watched Casino Royale and QoS tonight. Royale is a handsome movie but boy oh boy you feel those final 20mins.
Spectre. I have a weird feeling that I won't like this Bond movie. The best Daniel Craig bond movie was Casino Royale and that was perfect.
i watched casino royale yesterday and now im watching it again lol it's my favorite bond movie
Skyfall is my favorite Bond movie, followed by Casino Royale, then Goldfinger, Goldeneye, and.....The Spy Who Loved Me for my top five.
Just watched Casino Royale. Again. What a great movie.
Casino Royale is such an obscenely good movie. Every time I revisit it, I worry I'll love it less. Nope. It just gets better with age.

I love Bond but I've not watched a Bond movie since I gave up on Casino Royale halfway through.
Everyone's freaking about @starwars, and I think they forgot that the best Bond movie since Casino Royale is coming out next month.
QoS is a victim of the writers strike from ‘08. It’s a fine bridge to get Casino Royale to Skyfall in that it’s one long chase movie. 3/?
I haven't cared to watch a James Bond movie since "Casino Royale" but Christoph Waltz as the bad guy in "Spectre" has piqued my interest.
"Casino Royale" (1967) is a wooden movie (D) #DallasCritic <nwhs8f>
Rewatching the Craig era Bonds ahead of #SPECTRE. Casino Royale is still a brilliant movie. Problem is, now I've finished that, its QoS...
I forgot how much I love Casino Royale...great movie
@poprockgeek Goldfinger! Nothing like a Shirley Bassey song to lift any movie. Also Love Thunderball and You Know My Name from Casino Royale

Parkour chase in CASINO ROYALE is still more thrilling than any Bond set-piece since. Martin Campbell knows his way around an action movie

Been watching 'Casino Royale' on ITV2. Did you know it's the first ever Bond movie to make you properly think about James Bond's bollocks?
The big flaw with Casino Royale - structure. Takes too long to reach the actual casino. By then there's still an entire movie's worth to go.

Excited for Spectre but sad that it may be Daniel Craig's last outing as 007. Watching the terrific Casino Royale again. Such a great movie
our favorite movie since casino royale... ahh cant wait to watch with bae
@lowdudgeon Really exciting and adventure stories with a dash of horrible sexism and racism. Reread Casino Royale then watch the Craig movie
It’s movie time and I’m treating myself to Casino Royale while curled up in my bed. It’s so comforting. #MovieTime #MyComfort

the scene where Mads Mikkelsen shakily dabs away his bloody eye-leakage in Casino Royale is one of my favourite scenes in any movie
If I had to watch one movie over and over again, it would definitely be... Casino Royale #MoviesOnLoop
Tuesday movie was Casino Royale. Fantastic. With all the hoopla since about Skyfall it's been easy to forget how good this one is.
When has any song for a James Bond movie been "masculine?" I mean maybe Casino Royale or Thunderball
I think I enjoyed that Casino Royale movie a little bit too much #007

I kind of want to see the next Daniel Craig Bond movie to see how dark Bond can really go. Like, the torture scene from Casino Royale x 3
I have been in a mood for some Bond movies lately. Going with a bit of Casino Royale. There's a lot of running in this movie. Bond is fit.
Casino Royale ITV2 what a fantastic movie! DCs first outing as Bond, James Bond. Looking forward to Spectre A LOT!!!
@BradenPoirier Casino Royale is like the perfect bond movie
Casino Royale: My favorite bed time movie. Best Bond Ever. #DanielCraig

Praying for a Casino Royale team-up against Jeffrey Dean Morgan, c'mon movie gods, don't fail me now.
Getting tasked with looking at the editing in Casino Royale's opening made me so happy, it's like my favourite James Bond movie.
I hope the next James Bond movie is good, I haven't enjoyed them since Casino Royale

I am glad we are at the fourth movie establishing James Bond's origin. A lot of us were confused watching Casino Royale thinking James who?
Casino Royale isn't just my favorite Bond movie, it's one of my favorite movies period.
What Movie Is Better? RT-Skyfall Fav-Casino Royale
For Daniel Craig Bond movie theme songs so far: 1. Skyfall 2. Casino Royale 3. Spectre 4. Quantum of Solace. #SPECTRE
@Captain_Strongo yeah I did. Not sure why it's such a love song, either. This ain't no Casino Royale Bond movie
Daniel Craig is my favourite Bond. His Casino Royale is my favourite Bond movie. You can hate me now.
Bond themes don't indicate quality of the film. Skyfall song is great, movie is fine. You Know My Name is okay, Casino Royale is spectacular
@RWMCGRATH @SusanArendt skyfall is *fine.* casino royale has the best movie song i can think of, for p much anything.
CHRIS CORNELL - YOU KNOW MY NAME (Casino Royale Soundtrack) https://youtu.be/867iyhVFyEw  great song, great movie
@garywhitta CASINO ROYALE is 10x better, yet often overlooked. The best Bond and a top 10 action movie of all time as far as I'm concerned.
@APZonerunner I still need to finish up my viewing of the older ones, but Casino Royale is probably my favorite movie, not just Bond movie.
All this talk of Bond has influenced my choice of movie tonight. #nowwatching Casino Royale https://instagram.com/p/8DP2LjJAik/

Awwww what movie to watch casino royale, burlesque or quadrophenia !!!!
Casino Royale is the most shown James Bond movie on TV
Casino royale is the best Daniel Craig bond movie
Casino Royale may be a movie that's half an hour too long, but its worth it for this scene.
The parkour scene in Casino Royale remains one of the greatest scenes in a movie.
Haven't seen Casino Royale for ages!! bit of James Bond before bedtime can't wait until the next movie is out

Watching Casino Royale because its a fucking GREAT Bond movie! Way better than Skyfall and Craig at his best
Starting Quantum of Solace at 12:15 the night before I move out because Casino Royale (Great movie) ended on a cliffhanger. No ragrets...
Most people don’t know this but “Casino Royale” isn’t intended as a direct sequel to he 1995 movie “Casino.”
@therealelp James Bond's last good movie was Casino Royale in my opinion

#SPECTRE title song joins Dr. No, OHMSS, TSWLM, Octopussy, Casino Royale, & Quantum as @007 films not sharing movie/song titles #JamesBond
Extreme example: Live and Let Die (1973) to Casino Royale (2006). UK cinema ticket price increase = 1,032%; movie budget increase = 2,043%.
@jmousis never!! Great title for next movie. "Takeout Hike". Would go well alongside Casino Royale, Moonraker, You only live twice
"Casino Royale" is the only movie in history to turn a game of poker into a nail-biting experience.
Lyrics from "You Know My Name" by Chris Cornell, aka the theme tune of the James Bond movie 'Casino Royale' circa 2006, for the curious.

Well, yeah… not just him… but that was the gag of the movie. RT @huntertremayne: @DavidPoland David Niven, Casino Royale 67
@AaronWrotkowski living daylights is underrated af, love that movie. casino royale 67 is.....something
Final thoughts on Casino Royale: Daniel Craig has no swagger but lots of smug. The movie could have been 45 minutes shorter.
"Casino Royale" is on BBC America if anyone is on here reading this bad Twitter account and would rather watch a movie.
Man. Ten years later, and Casino Royale is still a damn good movie.
Casino Royale is such a cool movie.
Casino Royale is a good movie. Good job, Daniel Craig.
Casino Royale: Where Daniel Craig is the second hottest guy in the movie.
No work tomorrow, that means movie time. Casino Royale.
@puppygraham i love casino royale its my fav bond movie Ive seen I just didnt know who je was back then lmao

Casino Royale was a fairly strong Bond movie - even with the torture - till it ended on a downer mini-cliffhanger. Downhill, messagy since.
@TriassicPark I think so but I haven’t seen a bond movie since casino royale
@dingax1983 casino royale is my fav Bond book; live/let die is one of the most racist novels I've read-surprised they got a movie out of it

@HellPockets @TheHadou Casino Royale was the last good Bond movie anyway.
@misskubelik Casino Royale, I told the hub, it was an okay movie, but not a Bond movie.
On the subject of Casino Royale, if you haven't seen it yet, you really should. Great movie. https://youtu.be/BD0uP25yxl8 
@KyleKallgren Phrase I often say, "My favorite bond movie is Casino Royale. No, the other one. Yes, there was another one. It's a comedy."
I know that the 1960s Casino Royale movie is awful
@TlMBERWOLVES Also, Casino Royale is an actually decent movie. I won't speak to the rest, but that one can hold its own.
Casino Royale was a movie in which Daniel Craig's James Bond almost exclusively shot Africans. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/638725268128067584 …
Also SPOILERS Casino Royale had the best false ending of any action movie. I really bought it hook line and sinker. Just like Bond
@Zepp1978 People were nuts for that movie. I liked it. But I thought Casino Royale was better. I thought Quantum was underrated
@mucha_carlos @tanehisicoates @jbouie The whole movie was dumb, along with QoS. Casino Royale was great, though.

Quantum of Solace really just is "Action: The Generic Movie". Such a shame after Casino Royale.
@karaleung Casino Royale...Quantum of Solace is BOOOOORING though...Skyfall is my 2nd favorite Bond movie ever
Casino Royale was a good movie. But Bond never needed muscles, and never fell in love. Weak shit. Made me not even see Quantum of Solace
Casino Royale is the best Bond movie
Casino Royale was always a very weird movie

Casino Royale. Plot holes you could drive an Aston Martin through, but still an awesome movie. Blows Skyfall out the water!
#ManFromUNCLE is the best Bond movie since Casino Royale. @jamesbondrpg
Casino royale is one hell of a movie
The best spy-action movie I've seen since Casino Royale/Skyfall
Casino Royale is on. It's got have one of the best on-foot chase scenes of any movie.
"Casino Royale" (1967) is an unsatisfying movie (D) #AhiMovieReviews <ntcimz>
I hate James Bond but Casino Royale is a brilliant movie
Won't lie, if they made another Casino Royale parody in the vein of the 1967 movie, I would totally watch it if Rick Moranis was Jimmy Bond.

@ivanamilicevic just watched Casino Royale, you look good in a Bond movie too
Watching Casino Royale, @deannaraybourn, and Eva Green just walked in wearing purple satin. Feels like the high point of the movie to me.
Skyfall is probably the worse movie of all 3 bonds Daniel Craig has done. Casino Royale was on a diff level. But Spectre looks good 007
@OhCaptainBear Yeah. I was watching CASINO ROYALE the other night pondering whether or not Craig is a movie star. I think he is. Got "it".
I've been watching this Casino royale movie for like 20 mins now and theres literally been about a total of 25 seconds of actual speaking
@RyanMDempsey Damn you've put me on the spot. You should maybe watch Casino Royale. It's the first book i think, but not the first movie...
I watched Casino Royale and it was an awesome movie but I almost cried during the torture scene. #manhood
Casino Royale is like the best bond movie da real
http://ift.tt/1Lezl9x  Casino Royale is the greatest spy movie ever made.
The ending of casino royale is one of the only movie endings that actually gets to me
The chase scene in the beginning of the Daniel Craig Casino Royale is still the most epic chase scene I've ever seen in a movie
Outrageous claim: Casino Royale is the best Bond movie thus far.
Casino Royale is still the greatest movie ever...and Eva Green is perfect.
Casino Royale is the best Bond movie
If I had to watch one movie over and over again, it would definitely be... casino royale #MoviesOnLoop
Casino Royale is a really great spy movie.
There is no movie ending better than Casino Royale. Period.
Casino Royale will always be a mad movie
Casino Royale with Daniel Craig is a GREAT Bond movie
Forgot how good Casino Royale is. The best Daniel Craig Bond movie IMO #007
Watching Casino Royale. Daniel Craig is a great Bond. He's in some shape. Plus he can fight like two men and a wee lad in this movie.

How the hell is Casino Royale 9 years old... Still my favourite #Bond movie
The free running scene in Casino Royale has got to be one of the best scenes of any movie
@zakn I think he's a fantastic Bond tbh. And yep, Casino Royale is a peach of a movie.
Watching Casino Royale, love a James Bond movie!! #guiltypleasure #danielcraig #secretlove
Whatever they did. They got it right with Casino Royale. Excellent #Bond movie.
@Tweeter_Tori casino royale, unless zero dark thirty ends differently the 2nd time around, it's a tough movie to watch again
I love when you check the TV guide expecting there to be nothing on then you see a good film, Casino Royale, my favourite James Bond movie
Hmmmm, Casino Royale, Minority Report or Zero Dark Thirty? Movie choices...
@Simuntweets Aha! I love GoldenEye (his first #OO7 movie). And I love Casino Royale (Craigs first #OO7 movie).
Casino royale will always be a great movie
Casino Royale will forever be my favorite movie
Ahhh just found Casino Royale on tv, I love Bond and Vesper Lynd's first meeting on the train! Found my next movie I think ;)

Casino Royale is such a good movie.
Movie Quote of the Week: "Why is it that people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?" - James Bond, "Casino Royale"

You can't deny Casino Royale is a great action movie, let alone a Bond movie
@AlleyBeth Good movie! And it's also neat that you know there are more than one Casino Royale movies.
Hmm, Casino Royale (Daniel Craig) is on. I'm turning into a movie person I think. Haven't watched this many movies in a very long time.

@deggowaffles it works better. It’s more of an extended third act for Casino Royale than it is its own movie.
@pj_campbell Casino Royale is both a great movie and great Bond movie. Quantum is a solid action movie with a lame approach to Bond.

@zoeclaire_ Casino Royale introduces you to this Bond really well and is a fabulous movie. It does include a torture scene though

Movie review -casino royale- Moral of the story, don't trust people. Rate: 5/5
Bapak aku tengok Casino Royale dekat TV2. Tapi elok movie 3 jam, jadi 1 jam je. Sebab semua scenes dia nak potong
Casino Royale on tv2. Rmmbr when i watched the movie in dubai. Culture shock kejap bila tengok perangai orang arab dalam cinema haha
Personally I think Casino Royale is one of the best James Bond movie from Daniel Craig’s.
Aku tengah tengok Casino Royale kat tv2 ni. Berapa kali entah aku dah tengok movie ni tahun ni.

My favorite movie is Casino Royale, my second favorite is the new trailer for Spectre. Third............ Anchorman.
Much as I enjoyed Casino Royale, it didn't feel like a Bond movie. Glad to see Spectre keep running with Skyfall's remaster of classic Bond.
I'm so underwhelmed by the "Spectre" trailer, it's not even funny. Casino Royale and Skyfall got me so pumped for a new Bond movie. Not this
the only time i saw James Bond really in love was in Casino Royale,that was my favorite movie too
i might try to with casino royale soon… the only bond movie i own!
how am i supposed to enjoy another daniel craig bond movie when casino royale exists?!

CASINO ROYALE IS MY FAVE MOVIE
@YankeeCynic Casino Royale proved a Bond movie could have logical plot progression and three dimensional characters. Skyfall was regression.
Casino Royale is still daniel craigs best bond movie
At last a decent looking James Bond (Daniel Craig) movie #SPECTRE. Casino Royale was good but the others were iffy.
@FrankhamAllen Casino Royale is a brilliant movie. Huge change in tone from Die Another Day. And the beginning of a new story arc for Bond.
What font does Casino Royale movie use?http://www.allmoviefonts.com/Casino-Royale-Movie-Font/ …
Casino Royale is the best 007 movie. Quantum of Solace was a weird follow up. Skyfall was a gorgeous film and Spectre looks nuts.
@GabrielYNWA love skyfall. i think its better than casino royale, and probably a top 5 Bond movie
@marcfc The best Bond movie since Casino Royale is Skyfall.
WHEN WILL CASINO ROYALE GET THE RESPECT IT DESERVES AS THE BEST JAMES BOND MOVIE AND ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER FUCKING MADE
SPECTRE looks like it could be the best Bond movie since Casino Royale. Vintage Bond feel. Did I spot the OHMSS theme tune in the trailer?

@seelix I love when people comment that the torture scene in Casino Royale (movie) is homoerotic. I'm like YOU SHOULD SEE IT IN THE BOOK.
Welp, I finally saw Zardoz. Weirdest fucking movie I seen since David Lynch's Dune, or maybe Casino Royale 1967. https://youtu.be/fGV1kmATl0E 
@ALeeMartinez In what way do you feel that Casino Royale was nonsensical? Assume you met the movie rather than the Fleming novel.
The casino royale movie was much better with a big poker match than the original book version, which was just a slot machine competition
Casino Royale is definitely the best James Bond movie
Being an avid movie watcher and just realizing I haven't seen Casino Royale is having a great impact on my life.
@SamKingTV Movie suggestions: An Affair to Remember washed down with Casino Royale. Shaken. Not stirred.
Casino Royale is on!! Probably my favorite James Bond movie
So, Casino Royale (my favorite Bond movie) is also the booziest Bond blowout? http://ow.ly/Pzrt4 
Casino Royale and Skyfall are on cable at the same time. I'm going with Casino Royale. Better movie. #007
No Bond movie has ever had close to the amount of character development as Casino Royale and no more ever will.

@Uttara28, Why do I like Casino Royale? Because it's an Eva Green movie.

Casino Royale is my favorite James Bond movie
Also I think Casino Royale stole the concept from this movie: government agent hopes to trap criminal in high-stakes tournament of skill?
What's with the people who thought SKYFALL was darker than CASINO ROYALE? Did we see the same movie?
Y’know, Casino Royale is actually an incredibly overrated movie.
Painful moments in movie history: James Bond writing off the Aston in Casino Royale
Casino Royale is the best bond movie because 1. Obviously it is. 2. Chris Cornell does theme song. 3. The women are really really hot.

Skyfall is the best Bond movie in series' recent releases. Casino Royale comes a close second.
Good choice of best #Bond movie - it's my favourite of the books. [It's a tough call, but I prefer D Craig's Casino Royale.]
So, I'm watching the original James Bond Casino Royale ('67)... This is "battlefield earth" bad. How did this movie get made?

Upon watching Casino Royale yesterday I realised suddenly just how much phones, and tech in general, date a movie these days. #SonyEricsson
Casino Royale is still that movie #007JamesBond
Casino Royale is the perfect Bond movie. Each scene builds so perfectly on the next. Wonderful pacing. Eva Green nails every Vesper scene.
Casino Royale is definitely my favorite Bond movie
eva green was cold in casino royale. not as cold as olga kurylenko in quantum. and not even as cold as caterina murino in her own movie
Casino Royale Movie CLIP - Parkour Chase (2006) HD One of the best ever.No tricks, just epic action & filming. http://youtu.be/iZxNbAwY_rk 
Casino Royale is the best James Bond movie
The introduction of Eva Green's character in Casino Royale is one of the most perfect scenes in any James Bond movie, maybe any movie.
@simoncarless Was great in the movie Casino Royale
Bed ridden. DVD marathon continues. Now watching : Casino Royale. The best James Bond movie to date. Martin Campbell is the best.
Any Bond movie... I personally like Casino Royale. pic.twitter.com/Zu5bBUaG3h
Few directors get away w/ a harder PG-13 movie than Martin Campbell. Goldeneye, Mask of Zorro & Casino Royale = 3 of the roughest I've seen.
As I move (slowly) through my Bond marathon, I have finally arrived at Craig. Wow. Casino Royale is an excellent movie. Craig is fantastic.
@PopeOwned It really is a great movie. I'll watch Casino Royale. Again. :)
Interesting that Casino Royale is Flemming's most popular book. http://www.librarything.com/author/flemingian-1 … It's great, but not given a real movie until Craig.
Just finished Ian Fleming's casino royale. Nothing like the movie. #jamesbond #reading pic.twitter.com/qLbwVaD7PP

Casino Royale is prolly my favorite James Bond movie
Watching Casino Royale right now. The intro is not so great but the movie is good.
"The coldest blood runs through my veins/ You know my name" CASINO ROYALE is my favorite Bond movie. Everything about it is perfect.
I feel like this is somehow traitorous, but Casino Royale is 100% my favorite Bond movie. #ImSupposedToLikeOldStuff
The only movie scene that's hard for me to watch is the torture scene in 007: Casino Royale. Every man on the planet would probably agree.
Casino Royale is another great movie
McDonald's version of James Bond movie: Casino Royale With Cheese
Casino Royale is, without a doubt, my favorite Bond movie of all time.
Classic Bond movie.. Casino Royale
Casino Royale is actually a pretty solid movie.
Shame that they dumbed down this casino royale movie with them playing hold em poker in monaco.
Casino Royale is such a bad ass movie. The villain is sorta meh, & the poker plot is weak, but Eva Green erases all of that. Top 5 Bond Girl
The theme song for "Casino Royale" is terrible. I didn't need one, but now there's another reason to dislike this movie.
Casino Royale is on, love this movie. Couch night it is
The original James Bond movies will always be classics but Casino Royale is a damn good movie

The first movie I watched in 2015 was Casino Royale. One of my favorite movies
@CountessBezuhov Oh that does sound interesting. Did you see Bond movie "Casino Royale"? It's like that. @MemoirWriter
Watching Casino Royale with dad. I love the fight scenes in this movie SO MUCH.
@MissBrittHayes Casino Royale (an ideal Bond intro movie) then Skyfall
Just rewatched Casino Royale a simply superb Bond movie #JamesBond @007hertzrumble @SpcMan71 @RealGeorgieGirl @ChrisPowner
Watching Casino Royale. @bldfvr's first modern Bond movie. And brutus/black jack is in it!
When you watch Quantum of Solace directly after Casino Royale it feels like you're watch one, never ending movie. It also gets exhausting.
Casino Royale is probably the best James Bond movie that will ever be made.
"manduhime: casino royale is my favorite bond movie. i love gambling. i bet three gold fish crackers on black." Half-Life 3 confirmed
Casino Royale is such an incredible movie! The subsequent films haven't really come close. #bond
"That's a lot of alcohol....that's casino royale. Oh wait.... it's crown royal. That's definitely a James Bond movie"
I still think CASINO ROYALE is a slightly better movie than SKYFALL, but SKYFALL feels more like classic Bond in all the right ways.
Final movie of 2014. Casino Royale.

If CASINO ROYALE had the SKYFALL title song, it would have been the absolutely perfect Bond movie.
Finally watching the older Casino Royale. James Bond has a stutter It's pretty bad. What a horrible movie so far.
For me that's easy any Peter Sellars movie Get Smart any episode or the movie, The first Casino Royale crazy but... http://fb.me/1N8IvFJnQ 
Watching Casino Royale. Didn't realize how old that movie is until I saw the Sony Ericsson K800i, wowza
I love looking at you, you have fans from Indonesia, I like the same movie Casino royale her @DanielCra ig_007 :)
After suffering through the Moore era, I'd almost forgotten how much I love CASINO ROYALE. Damn great movie.
Skyfall is a great movie but Casino Royale has to be 2nd best Bond film after Goldfinger
Never get bored watching casino royale movie

I'll argue with any classic bond fan that Casino Royale is the best james bond movie
Casino Royale is my fave Bond movie by miles
Casino Royale. WHAT A MOVIE
My brother on Casino Royale: "The thing I love about this movie is that the bad guy is asthmatic." #imdead #CasinoRoyale #JamesBond
I've actually never watched a Daniel Craig Bond movie - should I bother with Casino Royale?!
Casino Royale is my favourite Bond movie, hands down

@TaraEAnderson yes. Live and Let Die is a better theme song than the movie deserves. Casino Royale is a fantastic movie, theme is awful.
pretty sure I just watched Quantum of Solace for the first time. Movie was forgettable. Casino Royale was better. #reviewed

Re- watching Casino Royale with Master Fool. Still the perfect Bond movie and faraway Craig's best outing. Skyfall pales in comparison.
And if you're wondering why I'm tweeting about that it's because it was a trailer on Casino Royale which is for family movie night tonight.
But stay confident I say, unnerved so thoroughly with how good Casino Royale 2005 movie has been. By the time Skyfall, by then
Working on my Vesper recipe and watching Casino Royale (2008). Man, what a great movie! My favorite of the franchise. #007
Watching now "A view to kill" on tv @TRANSTV_CORP Mohon info buat penayangan "Casino Royale" cause that is the most one of Bond's movie
@petty_marshall @Flalalaorida I kinda liked Casino Royale better. Quantum didn't feel like a James Bond movie to me.
"Casino Royale" is such a painfully tragic movie because of the scene when the Aston DB5 is crashed and to a lesser extent when Vesper dies.
Fav James Bond movie? Casino Royale.
Casino Royale is my favorite movie
Just doing a stuffing test run and watching that tradition Christmas movie... you know, Casino Royale.
The Madagascar chase scene in Casino Royale is one of the best movie scenes of all time.
I haven't watched an Eva movie in so long I need to watch Casino Royale and cry sometime soon
Casino Royale (A http://PopEntertainment.com  Movie Review) http://wp.me/p2OkTF-K0 
Casino Royale because I've never seen more than 15 minutes of a James Bond movie. #oops
I'm watching Casino Royale and Hannibal is the main villian which makes the movie even better.
2. Casino Royale (2006) - A phenomenal movie overall, and a great reboot. Craig does what I didn't think was possible - makes Bond seem real
25. Casino Royale (1967) - not an official Bond movie. Kinda funny but weird as shit. Makes no sense generally, everyone was on acid
Casino Royale is such a badass movie
You know, Skyfall actually was much better on rewatch for me than the first time. Very enjoyable Bond movie. No Casino Royale...but what is
Unconditional love for the movie Casino Royale.
Finishing Casino Royale and realizing that it might be a perfect movie. Excellent pacing, emotional, & feasible. Cannot wait for #SPECTRE
Casino Royale is such a great movie when you've grown up watching classic 007
If you watch closely Casino Royale is the greatest love story ever told. Also the only movie where Eva Green isn't topless at some point.
Man, Casino Royale is such a kick-ass movie. Awesome, sad, funny, etc... I get so many feels when watching that movie u_u
Guess not cause he's definitely in this movie. What happened in Casino Royale then? They just knocked him out? #quantumsolaceroast
Watched "Casino Royale" on #MGM today. Great soundtrack by Burt Bachrach, but damn, what a hot mess of a movie. #AwesomeCast
The first Bond movie I ever saw was Quantum of Solace. To this day I’ve only see that and Casino Royale.
Utakuja na Verbstract na avi yake? " @EngDamian: Casino Royale is the best Bond movie. Agree or get mobbed."

Bowling can be meditative. So can seeing movies alone. Casino Royale was my first solo movie theater experience, and it elevated my spirits.
I don't care much about the title " #SPECTRE". All I want is a good #JamesBond movie. Good on the level of Casino Royale, not Skyfall level.

#Bond27 really, 26 if you count the original Casino Royale as a teleplay, and not a movie.
they usually make an awesome bond movie,then the following one is subpar see DAD to casino royale,quantum of solace to Skyfall
@DunesAndDiamons i think i only saw the casino royale craig movie... Not against him as bond jst havnt seen him lol
On a scale of Casino Royale to Quantum of Solace, I hope the new Bond movie is a Goldfinger. Goldfingers crossed. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/30308894

Casino Royale done. Continues to be one of my favorite Bond movies, & just a terrific movie in general. Love it. Now onto Quantum Of Solace.
Chris Cornell's song from Casino Royale got crapped on when the movie came out, but time has been kind to it. It's pretty badass.
