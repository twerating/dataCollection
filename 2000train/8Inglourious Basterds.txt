17) my favorite movie is Inglourious Basterds & i HIGHLY suggest you watch it (btw that's not spelled wrong that's how it is lmao)
I always have to stop watching "Inglourious Basterds" after the movie theater scene.
Do you know what's a perfectly edited movie? Inglourious Basterds. There's a reason Sally Menke's name appears second in the end credits.
For the 4th year, my feel good movie for the holidays is Inglourious Basterds.

I rewatched Gremlins last night. I realized that Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is the exact same movie.

Inglourious basterds is Quentin Tarantino's best movie it's not even an argument
Spotting that there's a Pabst movie on TCM right now, 1st thought is the way Fassy said the German director's name in Inglourious Basterds.
How funny is that that Inglourious Basterds is a more realistic WWII movie simply because people aren't speaking English in every scene.

@Bunslovingbun Rod Taylor. Last movie was a Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds.
@CrissCain Inglourious Basterds for the Netflix movie my man, hope you enjoy the comedy club!
Also, re-watched Inglourious Basterds recently. Chapters one and four hold up, as does the Stiglitz scene. The rest of the movie does not.

Hey, Inglourious Basterds is on Netflix. You should watch it. It’s probably my #1 favorite movie.
I love the basement/tavern scene in "Inglourious Basterds" The cat and mouse in that movie absolutely kills.
Inglourious basterds is single handedly the greatest movie of all time
It's #tuesdaymovienight : INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS! Movie starts at 7.30pm FREE ENTRY - FREE POPCORN! SPREAD THE WORD RT!
Inglourious Basterds is a great bed time movie
Inglourious Basterds is the best Quentin Tarantino movie there is minus Pulp Fiction
Meant to just watch one scene in Inglourious Basterds the other day and now I'm accidentally watching every QT movie.
Inglourious Basterds is a top 5 movie for me

Inglourious Basterds is on Netflix now. My favorite movie. All is right with the world.

Memorial Day movie pairing: Schindler's List and Inglourious Basterds.

inglourious basterds is a great movie
So glad they put Inglourious Basterds on Netflix. Awesome movie. Tarantino has yet to do me wrong.
Inglourious Basterds is the perfect movie to start at 1AM midway into a holiday weekend.
Finally got around to finishing Inglourious Basterds... not a terribly great movie. Probably could have used that time better.
Oh hell yeah Inglourious Basterds is on Netflix now, you can never go wrong with a Tarantino movie

Inglourious Basterds is such an amazing movie.
The Inglourious Basterds movie theater scene continues to be incredible.
Pretty much everybody just dies at the end of Inglourious Basterds but it's still a badass movie
Do we all agree that Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's second-best movie?
Inglourious Basterds is one good ass movie
Inglourious Basterds is on. What a great movie.
Why is “Inglourious Basterds” playing on TNT? There will essentially be no movie left after all the editing.
I think Brad Pitt is so hot in pretty much every movie except Inglourious Basterds

Anyway, Django Unchained is nowhere near as good as Inglourious Basterds. The latter is his best movie so far, and by miles and miles.

Inglourious basterds was probably one of the best casted movie ever
ICYMI: obv parallel between American Sniper & Nazi propaganda movie in Inglourious Basterds makes conservatives sad http://ow.ly/HRAFC 
Bc that was never a part of the movie that stuck w me, so I wanted to see American Sniper & then watch Inglourious Basterds again to compare
Ever since Seth rogan made the comment about American Sniper being like the "Nation's Pride" movie in Inglourious Basterds I've wondered how
@GlasgowsDA @garyyounge impression I get is it's the sniper movie from Inglourious Basterds

In "Inglourious Basterds" the movie is called "Nation's Pride," in 2015, it's called "American Sniper." People are shocked by comparisons?
@sundaesmilemily great action movie, and pretty damn violent for its time, too. It's even more fun than Inglourious Basterds IMHO.

@Sethrogen "American Sniper reminded me of the Nazi propaganda movie that appears at the end of Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds"LOL
‘American Sniper’ Propaganda? Seth Rogen Tweet Compares Film To Fake Nazi Movie Within ‘Inglourious Basterds’ http://buff.ly/1yHHZcv 
How is this Oscar-nominated blockbuster different from inglourious basterds' propaganda movie-in-a-movie, exactly? http://rol.st/1BGLWA7 
" @ActorTrivia: Quentin Tarantino worked on the Inglourious Basterds script for almost a decade." Great movie @MrSwisherTweet
@Suuper_Cute American Sniper reminded him of fake sniper movie in Inglourious Basterds. Interpreted as "American sniper is nazi propaganda"
Is American Sniper just our version of the Nazi propaganda movie in Inglourious Basterds?
#AmericanSniper is the same Nazi propaganda movie shown in Inglourious Basterds "Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride)" ,100% same idea.
Movie marathon ★ Inglourious Basterds — https://path.com/p/DGtFE 
"American Sniper's IMDb German title: 'Stolz der Nation' aka the Nazi propaganda movie from Inglourious Basterds." HAHAHA!!
Is American Sniper pretty much the German sniper movie in Inglourious Basterds but American?
That movie that's showing in the third act of Inglourious Basterds reminds me of Seth Rogen's demise.
The movie within a movie in "Inglourious Basterds." http://fb.me/3C7mmwfW1 
@SimonRisidor @Sethrogen Wrong. He specifically referred to the "movie in act three of Inglourious Basterds". Did you even read his tweet?
Last night I said #AmericanSniper reminiscent of "Nations Pride" (the inglourious basterds nazi movie) & turns out Seth Rogan thought so 2
@Sethrogen lightheartedly compares American Sniper to Nazi propaganda movie in Inglourious Basterds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejF8LjohO-Y&feature=youtu.be … Hilarity ensues
It sounds like American Sniper is essentially the same movie that the Nazis were watching during Inglourious Basterds.
I haven't seen American Sniper, but from what I've heard, it reminds me of the Nazi propaganda movie from Inglourious Basterds.
tarantino spelled inglourious basterds that way so that leftists spotting the movie inside it IRL in 2015 could be berated by US fascists
People criticizing Seth Rogen obviously haven't seen Inglourious Basterds. There was a movie about a sniper in that film. It's fact.

i wont back down from comparing american sniper to the nazi propaganda movie from inglourious basterds, unlike the coward seth rogen
A silly controversy, but Rogen is correct. Inglourious Basterds' 'movie within a movie' is basically the Nazi version of American Sniper 1/n
RT @TheAVClub Seth Rogen points out how American Sniper is kind of like movie in Inglourious Basterds http://avc.lu/1BWiLb9 
American sniper really does remind me of the fake Nazi propaganda movie in Inglourious Basterds, which is also about a sniper
So this movie American Sniper is literally the nazi movie from Inglourious Basterds right? Tell me someone else sees this.
Folks, it's not even a real Nazi propaganda film. The events that took place in the movie Inglourious Basterds never took place. #SethRogan
Kind of have to wonder how similar AMERICAN SNIPER is to "Nation's Pride," the war movie playing during the climax of INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.
Just hit play on Inglourious Basterds. This movie is pure joy for me.
@PantherSlayer American Sniper IS that short movie from Inglourious Basterds
AMERICAN SNIPER is basically the movie that plays at the end of INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. #BurnItDown #OuiShoshanna

Django is my favorite Tarantino movie hands down. Inglourious Basterds is a great one too tho
I'll be damned if Inglourious Basterds isn't the perfect action movie. Absolute masterpiece.

The movie Fury looks like Inglourious Basterds 2: Tanks, same lines, same Brad Pitt. When not directed by Fincher, he's quite awful really.
i've probably killed a diehard inglourious basterds fan by disliking this movie

#Fury was incredible...Brad Pitts best movie since Inglourious Basterds

Just saw #Fury. Awesome, brutal movie. Realism of Saving Private Ryan with savagery and graphic novel storytelling of Inglourious Basterds.
Watched 'Fury' last night. Bit 'Saving Private Ryan', bit 'Inglourious Basterds', bit 'Platoon'. Good movie.

Oh man, Inglourious Basterds is on next weekend. I approve of these 4 hour movie fests. What a time to be alive.
The movie Inglourious Basterds. Based on fact. Terrorists dismembering German troops in the most horrible fashion. The horror.
The Nazis from "Inglourious Basterds" are locked in a movie theater rigged explode; a direct ripoff of "Gremlins".
@SherlockHelms @TooTallKeller Inglourious Basterds wasn't a good movie. It was a phenomenal movie
the only movie i own is inglourious basterds and last time i had no cable i watched it on loop continuously and now i can recite it all
#Fury was a really good war movie. Those fighting scenes got intense! Brad Pit role looked like a continuation of Inglourious Basterds. Lol
I'd say I want a movie about Lee in WWII as soon as it's declassified, but it would basically be Inglourious Basterds.
@SA_Rageaholic When WAS the last WWII movie anyway. My memory gaps after Inglourious Basterds.
Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's most entertaining movie, Jackie Brown his most emotionally mature, and Inglourious Basterds his smartest.
For a sec I thought this new Brad Pitt movie was some inglourious Basterds promo wtf
