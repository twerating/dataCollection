I think Spike Lee could've done the same movie without associating the name with Chicago. He could've even done an unnamed city, like Se7en.

Watching se7en again. I've forgotten how good this movie is. And winner ang opening credits.
I'm expecting a Se7en like twist on AHS Hotel with their call back on the movie with dude killing on commandments instead of sins.

There is so much of Se7en in #AHS Hotel! The pointy screw like strap on ..definitely ! Remember that knife strap on in the movie??
Seeing people finding similarities between AHS and The Shining. Have you guys even seen the movie Se7en?
AHS is looking a lot like the movie Se7en, another one of my favs
Alright, AHS is just copying the movie "Se7en" at this point.
This season of AHS is like a sexier version of the movie Se7en with vampires #whatsgoingonhere
I'm watching episode one of AHS and this lowkey reminds me of that movie "Se7en" with Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt.
Im finally gonna watch the movie #SE7EN where the famous #Whatsinthebox quote come from...

Not to mention the obvious reference to the movie, "Se7en", with the rape scene.
Se7en is such a great movie
I'm immediately reminded of the movie "Se7en" #AHSHotel #AHS
@ohwhalekelsey that scene with the sex...thing is literally straight outta the movie Se7en this whole show is reminding me of other things
So this is strongly reminding me of the movie Se7en
That scene was like the movie se7en.
No srsly, Ryan Murphy must really like the movie Se7en. I personally was traumatized by it, but to each their own. #AHSHotel
It looks like the movie Se7en, but on TV https://twitter.com/KenKRK/status/651944930269626369 …
So this is going to be a knockoff of the movie Se7en? #AHSHotel
that thing reminds me of that guy from the movie se7en

When I consider this movie's progressively grimy aesthetic I can imagine it inspiring David Fincher for Se7en.
@cameronesposito were you traumatized by the movie Se7en when you were a child as well? It turned me into a fucking basketcase.

Even though this movie is not great, it still thrills me for Justin. He often said in teen mag interviews that Se7en was his favorite movie.
Watching some scenes from Se7en : how many references from this movie i have seen in our own regional movies!!

How can I pronounce the title of the movie Se7en as anything other than "Sesevenen"?
@thefilmj3rk My wife prefers Se7en because of who dies at the end. I'd prefer "Social Network" making a good movie out of *that*.
"Seven (Se7en)" (1995) is a great experience for an audience who would truly appreciate this movie (A) #DallasCritic <nvgrc9>
A patron who has the f-word tattooed on the back of her neck just requested the movie Se7en. Now I'm scared. #LibrarianProblems

I hope I don't have nightmares because I thought about the movie SE7EN tonight.
I give the movie se7en an 8/10. a bit predictable, but would recommend
There's a shot in Phantasm 2 that looks like a shot in Se7en, so I'm going to assume David Fincher has seen this movie and liked it.

"Deliver us From Evil" kicked my ass. Total crossover between 1995s "Se7en" and 1973s "Exorcist." Phenomenal movie
Nobody knew Kevin Spacey was in Se7en. He wasn't in any movie trailers, wasn't on promo posters, wasn't even listed in the opening credits.
As one of the deadly sins it did not look like much fun on the movie Se7en. http://Headstrong.tk/link/axxmunzf4h 
Se7en is one of the best noir movies ever made. Neo-noir arse. I'm talking about the whole genre. A+ movie.
Se7en is also, without a doubt, Morgan Freeman's best work. This movie is so good.

@L7Stig this is the reaction I had to the movie Se7en where the detectives broke the case by casually asking for patron circ records.
@Jvckk Shows to watch on occasions like this - Seinfeld/South Park, movie - Interstellar, The Place Beyond The Pines, Sinister, Se7en.
I'm mentally traumatized by the movie se7en
In honor of the 20th anniversary of the movie Se7en, I give you one of the greatest movie quotes of all time: "What's in the box?!"
20 years ago I saw "Se7en." No movie has ever shocked me more than the "Sloth" victim scene. Still a disturbing, powerful and great film.
I can't believe Se7en was released almost 20 years ago. Perhaps my favorite Brad Pitt movie. https://www.yahoo.com/movies/seven-20-years-on-go-behind-the-scenes-of-that-129105333947.html …
So, "Se7en" turns 20 today. Great movie. Why can't Red ever deliver me Linda's head in a box? #BallBuster #IceQueen
@KSpaceyFans @KevinSpacey I can only agree. Still my fav thriller-movie #Se7en
Se7ev is 20! If you were 7 when you saw Se7en in theaters, you are now 27. You're also probably MESSED UP from watching that movie at age 7.
Was a casual movie lover for much of childhood. When my brother introduced me to Se7en & Usual Suspects, a fire was lit under me.
Se7en a top 5 most twisted movie I've ever seen
@weeaboo i thought the ending was a nod to se7en what with the fields and all. but yeah don't watch the 2nd season go straight for the movie

se7en is a good ass movie
SE7EN is on SyFy right now and I own it but holy shit it's been years I forgot what a great movie this is writing direction acting perfect.
se7en is legit my fav movie, call me crazy idc
@sharker102s Apparently the movie Se7en where the detectives broke the case by casually asking for patron circ records.
@EddieGarrison did you ever see that? William Shatner doing Se7en as Kirk, TJ Hooker & one other. Was a MTV Movie award bit. BEST EVAH!
i make fun of se7en a lot but its actually a rlly good movie
This "Damn I Feel Old" moment brought to you by the movie Se7en being 20 years old. Good grief.
When ur watching the movie Se7en, so ur mom has to leave the room...
Serious movie thought: there is no equivalent to Kevin Spacey secretly playing "John Doe" in Se7en. (1/2)
Se7en is a great movie
Drawing pages but Se7en is on TV. I can't stop watching. This movie is awesome.
the movie se7en was so easy to guess near the end i knew he either put her head in the box or her baby
I will never get sick of watching se7en. It's such a great movie
Never seen Se7en to watch it from the beginning. But this movie so amazing.
The movie Se7en is creepy as hell. But its got Morgan Freeman so i gotz to watch it.

What's in the boooooox? I love this movie. Se7en http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt0114369/ …
Eating boudin and crackers, drinking a Mexican coke and watching the only movie that ever actually disturbed me, Se7en...
se7en is a good ass movie
Dear SyFy channel: Se7en is not a movie that you bleep the obscenities in. Please stop fucking up classic movies. Kill yourselves.
The movie Se7en is one of my favvvvvssss

Oooh "Se7en" is going to be on!! Love that movie and can't believe it's 20 years old now!!
The Seven deadly sins... Gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, wrath. Se7en such a great intense movie! #classic #thriller

the only movie that's allowed to use a numeral in the place of a letter is Se7en, everyone else leave
Se7en unreal movie
Watching the movie Se7en, sees Morgan Freeman. Roxanne: OMG SAMUEL L JACKSON!!
Watching SE7EN. still my all time favorite movie.
#Moviecount 14 Se7en (1995) David Fincher and Brad Pitt together yay! Kevin Spacey is brilliant and subtle. Amazingly tense movie.

@SaveJonBriggs what do you think they'll call the sixth sequel to the movie Se7en? I can't believe I'm burning an amazing tweet premise here
Wow ok I did not need to be fucked up by a movie today but congrats Se7en you fucked me up pretty good
@ViviannAmir The episode is a parody of the movie se7en. It should make perfect-ish sense if you've seen the movie.
Se7en... that movie ending fucked me UP https://twitter.com/filmquestions/status/618922151081574404 …
Se7en was a really good movie. Crime movies are always a favorite of mine.

The ending of Se7en is my favorite movie ending by far!!

My dad and I are almost at the end of Se7en and even though I've watched the movie, this ending gets my heart pounding
The dynamic that brad Pitt and Morgan freeman have in Se7en is one of the reasons this movie is so great
Se7en is a good movie

Se7en on HBO right now as well. I love this movie more than most things.
se7en is such a fuckin great movie!!
Se7en might be the movie to watch tonight !
Se7en was such a dope movie.
This Gift movie preview keeps asking "what's in the box?" Se7en answered this 20 years ago. SPOILER ALERT!! #ItsGwynethPaltrowsHead
After some rest the movie marathon continues with a dark turn with Se7en
still shaken after seeing the movie #Se7en
This is why you nameyour movie Fant4stic - just because putting numbers in the middle worked for Se7en doesn't mean it will for you too
The new movie The Gift got its title from that flick with naked Katie Holmes and its tagline from Brad Pitt's Se7en rant. Is nothing sacred?
Fuck ! Que final de la movie #se7en
a preview for the movie The Gift used the line "What's in the box?!" ... Brad Pitt should SUE their asses for that. #se7en

The 1995 movie Se7en also featured the deadly sins, and Brad Pitt's salary was, appropriately, $7 million. #seven pic.twitter.com/KfxPanZDgN
Southpaw is not* the best movie ever made. You obviously haven't seen the shawshank redemption, goodfellas, the godfather, or even se7en.

Brad Pitt and Morgan freeman are Detectives and Kevin Spacey is the evil murderer ...1995 best movie. Se7en
@CompleteArse Se7en, Back to the Future, Brotherhood of War (Korean war movie), Schindler's List and Whiplash.
Se7en is such a great movie. Does that make me a serial killer?
also why is Se7en on Syfy. Some wacky shit goes down in that movie, but I wouldn't call it science fiction
Se7en might be my favorite movie ever made.
Se7en is on tv. Literally a movie I've seen once, and that's enough. Disturbing as hell. Only other film like it was Mothman Prophecies

People make it out the DCEU to have the time of Se7en or a Fincher movie, I'm not sure if people fully understand what the word "dark" means
Watched #Se7en again.. Those last 15min. Man u stole the show. Those 15min is the whole movie @KevinSpacey .
@reaveneast it's my favorite Kevin Spacey movie!! Well kind of it's like a three way tie with se7en and the usual suspects
OH MY GOD WHAT A MOVIE #Se7en what happened to good screenwriters? why does every movie have to be an adaptation of something

Se7en is such a fxking good movie. Damn those movie plots.
How many killings has the movie Se7en got? @leagueofgentlem
Good movie " @Scofield_Barca: Se7en"
I'll tell you what, SE7EN is a brilliant movie.
For those dismissing Point Break as a bad movie: the chase scene directly inspired chase scenes in Se7en and the Matrix.
now i’m thinking about that impossible-to-pronounce movie se7en
I imagine for people who have an irrational hatred of #gwynethpaltrow, #Se7en must be a very satisfying movie. #Movies

Gwyneth Paltrow has a very pretty head in this movie. You almost can't blame Kevin Spacey for wanting to keep it. #Se7en

"Se7en" is a great movie but I'll never call it "Seven". Its " Sesevenen".
I've always wondered what would've happened if Friends, Seinfeld & Se7en met. They all inhabit New York in the 90s. I'd watch that movie.

it's been 20 years since Se7en came out, and it's such a great movie and also it has you on the edge through out the entire movie

first time I'm ever watching the movie Se7en. Why wasnt there ever a parody called Car7in? about the 7 words you cant say on television.
Whenever I cut my negatives I picture myself in the middle of the intro to the movie Se7en. Only less crazy and creepy.
@filmsanonymous se7en that's a good mystery movie, well I just came back from being chased by my neighbours dog #NotFun
Usually it is a book or movie that I think will either be too boring or too disturbing for me to consume, like Dune or Se7en, respectively.
And then my February movie list: Se7en, Heat, Good Will Hunting, Thelma and Louise, Princess Mononoke, Juice, Con Air, The Sixth Sense...

se7en is a good movie right
Se7en is such a good movie. I love those kinds of suspenseful films that keep your brain thinking.
who's seen the movie se7en, allstat cast #greatfilm
Kevin Spacey showing up in any movie is such a good moment. The best movie moment ever might be him showing up in Se7en. Man.
Watching Se7en on Netflix with the wife right now. I always forget just how damn good this movie is until I'm watching it again.
Se7en is such a fantastic movie
Even though I've been spoiled on the ending, Seven or "Se7en" is still an awesome movie. Brad Pitt is such a good actor.
#RandomThought: Why hasn't anyone mashed up "My D**k in a Box" with the movie Se7en! "What's in the box? #SNLClassic pic.twitter.com/OpZvbJle4D
@spideymtl @sinonmedia A Ghost Rider movie needs to have a Se7en/Silence of the Lambs with a spoonful of black comedy vibe.
Every time I watch Se7en Im reminded as to why it's such an amazing movie....Its almost like too deep & dark for me
The movie Se7en is fuuuuucked up, yet incredibly good
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/hImAmM5-Fpg?a  Se7en (3/5) Movie CLIP - John Doe Surrenders (1995) HD

Hopefully you have watched Se7en(1995) movie. What do think is the most deadliest sin? For me :Its LUST. Destroy more than others.

SE7EN is one of the craziest movie ever.... The ending is unreal #WHATSINTHEBOX
Se7en:A disturbingly great movie. Each murder shown so violently and leaves it planted in ur brain. Physiological thriller at its best. 9/10
Se7en.... What a fucking movie
Congrats to @renaud112 for winning name that movie challenge! What's in the box? Answer: Se7en. Gave credit for Seven. $BOX IPO later today!
" @LaMonicaBuzz: What's in the $BOX? What's in the $BOX? Name that movie for Buzz shout-out. It's easy. Anyway, $BOX prices IPO at $14 Se7en
This movie is brought to you today by the number Se7en and the letters R.I.P.D #SeasmeStreetAMovie
I watched the movie Se7en last night... It would've been a great movie... But the ending pissed me off. And not in a good way like Inception
I’ve seen the movie SE7EN a hundred times and never realized the song “Love Plus One” is playing in the pizza parlor scene with the Fed.
Movie idea: Se7en, but urban dictionary definitions instead of the seven deadly sins.
@Sh1eldbearerCTR @JulesRPG Unless the box being opened is the one at the end of the movie "Se7en", I don't get it either.
When you have to pause a movie and take a break because it's just getting too scary. Se7en isn't even a horror and I'm a wuss.
@Michael5SOS have you seen Se7en, that's the greatest movie ever, period.

@mrwalkerlasa I don't think a movie has made me that uncomfortable since I saw Se7en.
Check In: Se7en (1995) http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt0114369/ … After a solid 90 min at the park, time for a movie that is in my Top five of all time!
Birthday was perfect.Wishes from friends/family.hot dogs for dinner, watched favorite movie Se7en, and ate Camoflage cake made by @figment7
I had a dream about the movie Se7en, only instead of Morgan Freeman in it, it was Bill Cosby.
So there's a TV series called Numb3rs, a film called Se7en, a book called Ei8ht? I'm pretty sure we're on our way to a movie called 5318008.
Good Article: Alternative ending storyboards for Se7en http://imgur.com/gallery/coswQ/new … #movie
se7en is the best psychological movie I've ever seen and frankly THE best movie I've ever seen
This happened with SE7EN -- nine drafts in, it was an buddy-action movie with wisecracking cops and no head in a box anywhere.
I watched a movie called se7en starring Morgan Freeman from 1995 last night and I missed the entire point of the movie it made no sense
bish tf se7en is a gr8 movie
Speaking that, first movie on a date night should be Se7en. Can't believe it's twenty years old now.
se7en was an amazing movie FUCK I HOPE U GUYS ALL SAW IT
@TwtLelaki Fav movie... Leon the Professional, Fight Club, Titanic, Se7en, The Prestige, Inception
talk to me about big hero 6, I'll cry talk to me about se7en, I'll shout talk to me about any tom cruise movie, I'll stare at you in awe
Vengeance and Wrath - Se7en (5/5) Movie CLIP (1995) HD @MadMax9990 http://youtu.be/VN9icwiN6io 
Movie plans for today: Zodiac, Se7en and Good Morning Vietnam. Not sure after that.
Thriller movie recommendations from the past week: 1. Zodiac 2. Pulp Fiction 3. Se7en 4. Argo 5. The immitation game.
Now to think about it, my favorite opening credits sequence is from Se7en. Sets up the rest of the movie surprisingly well. #movie #tone
At the end of the movie Se7en when Morgan Freeman finds the wife's head in that box >>>
Watching Gone Girl reminds me of se7en, a criminal thriller movie directed by the same director, David Fincher. Both are my favourite.
Oh and someone loves the movie Se7en GET ME OUT OF HERE
I put the movie se7en on Netflix watched 10 min then skipped to the end to hear brad pitt say what's in the box then turned it off

If you're looking for a good movie, we highly #Recommend on Se7en. For more #suggestions: http://bit.ly/1tBhNdlbit.ly/1tBhNdl …
i'm not usually one to ask for more violence in a movie but i feel like the majority of the dialogue in se7en was spent on freeman & pitt's
Se7en is THE greatest movie ever made
Se7en is the most mind blowing movie
The ending of Gone Girl and Se7en completely ruined the entire movie, I do not care what high rating it got on imdb; it's soo bad
Omg Se7en is on #Netflix !!! I've seen it 5872 times but WTH ill watch again. Love that movie...
@stillgray if you were going to recast the movie Se7en with dogs, which breeds would play which characters?

Actually, it's "Lucky Number Slevin". RT @satellitehigh serious question: is the actual movie title “seven” or “se7en”
