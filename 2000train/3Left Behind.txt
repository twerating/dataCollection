I don't want to spoil Left Behind for you, but there's a lot of people who disappear in the middle of the movie.
Left behind is such a great movie it make you really wanna change your life around. Which I've been trying to do.
This new 'Left Behind' movie is a great value. I'm only 24 minutes in, but it seems like I've been watching it for 2 hours.
My dream last night was just like the movie "left behind". I refuse to be left behind.
You know that movie scene where someone rushes to leave and the camera zooms in on a crucial item they've left behind? That's my life.
if I'm ever in a horror movie scenario and someone's being the cliche hysterical, useless, crying type, they're being left behind.

Watched: Left Behind (2014). Religious apocalyptic movie. Pretty terrible script and acting. Lots of dull and pointless scenes.
