PAPER TOWNS IS THE CUTEST MOVIE EVER
Paper Towns is such a awesome movie. Shame it wasn't out for long in the uk.
something I just heard in target "did you end up reading paper towns?" "no because I saw the movie" ugly.
Just watched the movie Paper Towns, which I thought was called "Paper Towels", and I've never been more confused in my life.
@dom_monet how bud did u like my tweet it was from paper towns have u seen that movie before
There were some things that the Paper Towns movie got right and some got wrong...
They could've done SOOOO much better with the Paper Towns movie. The book was so In depth and thought provoking. The movie was corny.
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/PUpPrneP5Z8?a  Sam Bruno - Search Party [Paper Towns Movie Soundtrack] (2015) (Lyrics)
@Caradelevingne just saw "Paper Towns". Congratulations! It is amazing! You are amazing! A lot of meaning was included in the movie! Love u!
I'm watching this Paper Towns movie and I think this Margo girl is childish.
the paper towns movie is as good as the book. okae...
I just watched paper towns for the first time and I'm so fucking done. Literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
The only thing i loved about Paper Towns movie is @AnselElgort's appearance Augustus Waters
The best part of watching the Paper Towns movie was that Augustus Water was alive. Jk! #bookwormthings #BookNerdProblems
Just watched Paper Towns, considering the book wasnt that good, the movie is actually good, not great but yeah not a waste either
I actually really liked the Paper Towns movie. There was a much larger emphasis on Margo being just a girl and not a miracle.
Watched Paper Towns. Another life-changing movie. And I could relate to how Margo is lost and finding her way.

I'll watch paper towns until Q finds Margo. Then I turn it off because the ending is complete crap. Both movie and book version. Total crap
They showed PAPER TOWNS as the in-flight movie and that cinematographer put the worst shadows on Delevingne's face. Model made ghastly.
Just rented Paper Towns for free on my new TV. Time to grab a snack and watch a movie.
if paper towns (movie) was released in 2007 it might've been a hit. maybe. possibly.
Wait, Ansel Elgort was probably the best part of Paper Towns. Hahahaha. But srsly waaay better than I expected the movie to be.
ok but paper towns flopped does that movie still exist
In 2 days....I watched paper towns, San Andreas, vacation, catching fire part 2, and fantastic 4.... So what next #movie #watching
