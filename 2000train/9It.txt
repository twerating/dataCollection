Ok. The only thing is that IT'S NOT. it's really just from a movie. https://twitter.com/dmitri_gusev/status/678295763605168128 …
FORCE AWAKENS is really bringing out the "it's just a movie, don't think about it" guys.
We're going to see the Star Wars at the movie place. I hope Spock is in it. #caring

Star Wars is just one more stupid space movie that doesn't have me in it.
That aside.. The movie hit me right in the childhood just as much as it needed to, it's a must watch, for sure. :)

Waiting for #Dilwale here in Pak, hope it will be an Awesome Movie this Year and Congrats for BLOCK start Yestarday @kritisanon .
I have a confession. I have not watched a single Star Wars movie in the history of mankind and I'm okay with it
#MSG2In453 @MSGTheFilm is really an inspirational movie.. I recommend to everyone if u want self motivation then u must watch it
I'll admit that the movie plays it safe and borrows heavily from the originals, but that doesn't make The Road Chip any less entertaining.
big shout out to my buddy @JohnBoyega for his awesome movie #starwarstheforceawakens go watch it if you haven't yet pic.twitter.com/GB3SamAxDF
The only way anyone could spoil the new Star Wars movie for me is by making me watch it.

Before "Clueless" became a movie, it was pitched as a TV show, but 20th Century Fox rejected it because it had "too many girls."

Headed out to see the new Star Wars movie, anyone else plan on seeing it tonight/this weekend?!
That was a genuinely great movie. Star Wars has become a shared mythology for us--Abrams both honored and expanded it.
If I see someone tweet about Star Wars & ruining the movie before I see it, I will fight you.

Brazil shutting off WhatsApp is so odd. They should have watched that Terry Gilliam future dystopia movie - I forget what it’s called.

The movie rewards you more the less you know coming in. For once, people should just stop trying to outsmart a movie and just enjoy it.
I've only seen the first Harry Potter movie and I think it's safe to assume that nothing that happens in the other 15 of them is interesting

Falling asleep watching the Godzilla movie from 1998. One of my favorite movies as a kid. Probably seen it 50+ times.
if you label your youtube video"(movie) TRAILER!" and it starts with your dumb face saying "hey whats up guys", please just kill yourself.
It's so cute how you say your favorite movie is The Godfather, but you mispronounce it The Big Lebowski.
Also involves feelings of melancholy & estrangement, ends with a miracle reuniting a family. It's a Christmas movie. https://twitter.com/Rover537/status/676224883261579265 …

Really don't have no movie stations lol but just told my grandma to order HBO for January 9th and I'll pay her and then cancel it lol #cole
@TheInSneider I disagree. It's the social equivalent of TV ads touting a movie as "The #1 comedy in America." Self-promotion is paramount.
A week from today I'll be seeing a new Star Wars movie. I still vividly recall seeing my first in 1977 at 7yo. It changed my life.
and hold on, i just hope we get at least one cherik scene so i can rewatch it till the movie comes out.
@DrunkStyleDylan @KianLawley in German it's called "vieleicht lieber morgen" and the movie is so beautiful and funny and I just love it!

I'm actually hyped for tmnt 2. It looks like the older cartoon. Only thing I'm sad about is the movie isn't coming out on my bday again lol.
I like it except for the part that I can't help thinking that I look like a villain in a bad 90s Steven Seagal movie.
The TMNT 2 trailer gave me goosebumps. I just hope the movie has more martial art in it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeaugHGd1Kw …

#pvereads #5th My favorite holiday book is The Polar Express, because it is cool (no pun intended) and fun! P.S. The movie is WAY better!!!
Pretty happy with the movie #GoldenGlobes noms. Was happy to see Mad Max in there! Must admit I didn't think it would get love like that!
No! Bad DC! You are not allowed to make a Batman/Deadshot movie until I get to write it!

TMNT 2014 was kinda dumb and predictable, but it wasn't the worst movie in the world. It had a few good laughs. I'm fine with a sequel.

@SWMegafan Yes, it's not until Dec 14 (world premiere of the movie) that we can trust ppl who said they seen the movie,

Just by watching the trailer for the new Turtles movie, even if you didn't know who was making it, you could tell it's Michael Bay.
@katsudonburi You are me. Spoilers rarely, if ever, bother me for the same reason. If the book/movie is good, it'll survive spoilering.
I just saw the trailer for the new TMNT movie lets just say I'm very excited for it to come out lol
Just realized that next week is the opening of the new Star Wars movie. I'm actually pumped again to see it. Just the SW book "AFTERMATH"!
Not only is it the holiday season, it is also movie trailer season. Civil war and BvS last week, TMNT2 today, and X-men apocalypse tomorrow.

@kristenlanae I know right, I don't mind paying a couple morefor a good seat that I know it's mine . Arrive 10-5 minutes before the movie
@ThomasStorai @Wildhunky & I think @ this juncture, it's pointless 4 them 2 b doing this since the movie is just around the corner
The important thing about any Dark Tower movie though is that it takes place in the MCU.
Pretty sure The Grudge is the only scary movie @Jessica_StClair has seen because she mentions it on every CBB podcast.

Ninja Turtles 2 looks entertaining, I enjoyed the last one. Was it a GOOD movie? No, but it was a fun movie. I set my expectations low.
A single frame of a movie communicates a lot: who's alive, who's okay, where they are. If it's from the end, the beginning lacks tension.
