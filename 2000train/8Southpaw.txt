Southpaw is one really great movie, whoa.
The movie southpaw just broke my heart into a million tiny pieces :(((((
Speaking of movies...Creed looks dope I still gotta see that. Tough coming in behind Southpaw tho, that movie was epic.
southpaw & creed >>> any other boxing movie
This southpaw movie is so sad. I couldn't have watched it in public... People would think I'm not ok.
I can't go with "Southpaw" movie ! Its to touching and amazing!
southpaw was a great movie. But creed was way better. Great movie
Holy shit Southpaw is a good fucking movie
Southpaw is the best movie regardless
This SouthPaw movie is sad
Southpaw's a good movie i swear
I haven't watched creed. but I feel like southpaw already got me for best boxing movie this year...

20 mins in to Southpaw and I'm cryin, this must be a great movie
This movie keeps breaking my heart  — watching Southpaw
Southpaw is seriously the best movie I've seen in a long time 10/10 would recommend
@Chris_Stuckmann No, Southpaw showed the entire movie. This showed a few key shots and conversations. Not nearly every plot point.
why tf is southpaw so sad got me crying the whole movie my god
@Amirosie I feel like I've seen key scenes and climaxes of the movie. Reminds me a little of the southpaw trailer in that sense
Creed is a good movie, but in my personal opinion, i think Southpaw is better
Watching Southpaw again. This movie is awesome.
Just watched Southpaw for the first time ever. Straight bawled through the whole movie. #GreatMovie
Maybe Nick Emery recently saw the movie "Southpaw" with that left hook... Wait jk that's rated R and he'd NEVER do such a thing!
No, I am still thinking about Southpaw. That movie made me cry soooooooo hard.
creed was a badass movie but southpaw still better!

AFTER SOUTHPAW I THOUGHT I'D SEEN MY FAVOURITE BOXING MOVIE. CREED WAS EVEN BETTER
