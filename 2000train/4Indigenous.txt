People are actually making the movie Avatar about "the environment"...NOT about the *destruction* of indigenous cultures around the WORLD
How appropriate that they always play the Avatar movie around Thanksgiving - story of indigenous people being run out of their land.
The movie Avatar is about neoliberalism and it's true impact on indigenous or "third world" countries. I love that movie

How are people okay with the Green Inferno movie coming out??? It's these kind of movies that make people scared of indigenous tribes
Apacolypto movie accurately depicts the liberal noble savage as indigenous tribal peoples—just as wicked and violent as anybody else.

@RottenTomatoes @eliroth @TheGreenInferno @eliroth What's the rationale behind making an indigenous group the villain of your movie?
@AstridKitten76 So making a movie vilifying indigenous groups is better? THIS MAKES NO SENSE.
@Mike_hugs leave it to Hollywood to make a movie set in indigenous peoples' struggle ENTIRELY ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE
. @TheGreenInferno And none of those were indigenous, much less from the Amazon, right? Why not make a white ppl cannibal movie?
What's up TwitterLand? Let's stop this #GreenInferno crap movie by #EliRoth huh? #BoycottGreenInferno. Stop demonizing Indigenous people
Let me just watch this savage ass movie about indigenous people murking each other to help get me out my feelings
Did Eli Roth seriously make a horror movie portraying indigenous people as evil cannibals in 2015? What?
Indigenous is the crappiest "horror" movie ever seriously why did I even watch it
