I liked a @YouTube video from @couch_reviews http://youtu.be/0MsWCSl8f4o?a  24 Reasons The Fly & Fantastic Four Are The Same Movie
Is it me, or are digital movie rentals getting more expensive? I am not about to pay $5.99 to rent Fantastic Four or Scorch Trials.
A coworker came to me. Said he bought the new Fantastic Four movie. He watched it. He feels nothing but regret for this terrible decision.
I just realized: since the Hate-Monger made his first Marvel appearance in "Fantastic Four," Fox owns the movie rights to Hitler.
You want to see Fantastic Four again, but don't want to pay Fox? Its now up on our YouTube! http://youtu.be/Bxwbgng9UyU?a

An avengers/guardians/xmen/fantastic four movie would make my life.
I don't understand how there is already another Fantastic Four movie out with a different cast? Didn't one come out like 4 years ago?
Seeing how terrible this Fantastic Four movie really is.
they sold X-Men, Spider-Man and Fantastic Four.Thats the story of why Marvel has to reach to make a movie universe and why
X-men isn't an action movie it's a soap opera, fantastic four aren't superheroes, they're explorers, only I know what comics are about.
This 2015 Fantastic Four movie No winder it flopped at the cinemas
watching the new fantastic four movie yuck

You want to make a good Fantastic Four movie? Start the movie with the experiment. Then reveal the backstory gradually throughout the film.
Another thing about Fantastic Four, halfway through the movie, Reed, the main character, disappears for about 20 minutes. He just runs away.

Nothing fantastic about this Fantastic Four movie, they should've skipped that part
@JoeyRichter thank god this movie happened to Michael B Jordan, such a talented guy. He didn't deserve Fantastic Four in his life.
Will a good Fantastic Four movie ever be made though? Wasted my 90+ mins watching trash
Creed Star Michael B. Jordan Would Gladly Do A Superhero Movie Again; Talks Fantastic Four http://dlvr.it/CsvxDR  #movies
@Joezylla Sounds like this is a movie much more worthy of him than Fantastic Four. LOL
Figured out how to reboot the Fantastic Four as a movie entity. Similar to X-Men: First Class… make it retro and follow the comics-ish.

I, for one, quite enjoyed that Fantastic Four movie! #unpopularopinion
EDITORIAL: FANTASTIC FOUR - A Movie Pitch By Khanlark - Comic Book Movie (satire) (press release) (... | @scoopit http://sco.lt/6WqrZ3 
fantastic four 2.0 is such a lame movie (except for miles teller)
29_scene: Fantastic flop Twentieth Century Fox is so unhappy about the flop of its Fantastic Four superhero movie… http://dlvr.it/Csn1L1 
Fox is releasing Fantastic Four on Blu-Ray Dec 15th. That's on purpose because the target audience will be distracted with another movie
Ima force myself to watch that Fantastic Four movie one of these days.
Fantastic four was the worst movie I have ever seen
@AlexanderThrond I was so scared that Fantastic Four would destroy them, but then he came and gave that movie a hookshot with Creed!
Finally saw how Dr. Doom looked in the new fantastic four movie...I'm pretty disappointed...well the whole movie is a disappointment
Also had just enough time to watch the recent Fantastic Four movie. Not as horrible as I'd heard. Biggest flaw: no @TheRealStanLee cameo!
Fair point about just how terrible the new Fantastic Four movie is. Not even Stan Lee would cameo in it (which he does in all Marvel movies)
If you thought the 2015 Fantastic Four movie was a mistake, so was the one made back in 2005.
What do you call a bad Fantastic Four movie? A Fantastic Four movie
Damn hella disappointed in the new fantastic four..love that cast but the movie was so bad
@stonemtn As God as my witness…I thought a “Fantastic Four” movie reboot could fly.

45 minutes in and they still don't have their powers?? this movie is so boring and dark omg fantastic four isn't supposed to be like that
That's like debating what's better between Taken 3 the new Fantastic Four movie n Ben Affleck's Daredevil
I'm watching the fantastic four movie ... and the first six minutes are actually quite good?

Lmao after that last fantastic four movie … Naw they gotta retire that trash
I have yet to watch the new Fantastic Four movie. I've heard terrible reviews about the movie so I think I'll spare my eyes and time.
No comparisons to the Civil War comic. Marvel couldn't replicate that even if they had the movie rights to X-Men and Fantastic Four.
@MARKYNEXTDOOR45 @SuperheroFeed saying Fantastic Four was a good movie are already fighting word, boy.
and fantastic four was my fav superhero movie because duh like have you seen the original
Also, I watched a GAWD AWFUL movie called 500 MPH Storm the other day. It has a 10% on RT. Fantastic Four (2015) 8%. Y'ALL ARE LYING!

We’re 5 years away from you nerds loving that Fantastic Four movie.
I do not buy into the premise that there is a "good movie" underneath "Fantastic Four" when they couldn't even bother with a wig. A WIG.
That's why I think the Fantastic Four could be done as a TV series, not everything needs a mega budget movie.

Why is any Fantastic Four movie such a poisoned chalice? It should be easy to get right: great characters and a super archive of adventures!
Now maybe we can get the Tommy Wiseau helmed Fantastic Four movie we all deserve. It'll be called “The Room 2."
But a Marvel Studios Fantastic Four movie would be a prime chance to use Namor finally, since Surfer, Galactus and Doom have been done.

Marvel really messed up by selling the rights to the X-Men and Fantastic Four. I'm reading Secret Wars thinking this would be a great movie.
@audreyhacker can they just stop making these and focus on trying to make at least one great fantastic four movie
@dcseth - Man, the special effects for the next "Fantastic Four" movie are just laughable.
The only big disappointment of the year, so far, has been FANTASTIC FOUR. I was so ready for an awesome FF movie. It really is too bad.
@DoofiestDoofz @HeckuvaMouse rock band 3 was my favorite fantastic four movie

Fantastic Four http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt1502712/ … | What a terrible movie. Did anyone read this script before letting them film? Fuuu.
This Fantastic Four movie is soooooo trash it hurts
I was watching Fantastic Four, and I was like, this isn't that bad. Then the last third of the movie started. Yeah, it's that bad.
Fantastic four's 3rd act is highkey one of the worst finales in a movie ever
I still remember when I thought fantastic four was going to be great. But then fox decided to hide the movie from everyone. *sigh*
Fantastic Four wasn't the worst movie in the world guys. Come on. It wasn't necessarily good but there was some great stuff in it
I want people to be honest: is there anyone out there who truly loved this year's Fantastic Four movie? ...No one will hurt you
The Fantastic Four is a super powered blended family that loves science and adventure. Make that movie and everyone wins.
Oh my god hes the torch from 2015 fantastic four movie

The Incredibles really is a Fantastic Four movie with the plot of Iron Man 3.

Fantastic Four Movie, nowhere near as bad as Critics made out.. Not gonna win any awards or spawn a sequel but definitely worth a watch.
last movie I saw on bootleg DVD was probably either fantastic four rise of the silver surfer or snakes on a plane
Movie came on with some really nice young cast. Then I find out it's the new Fantastic Four. Such a waste of talent.

If you haven't seen the 2015 fantastic four movie, DON'T. It can actually cause cancer. rt to save a life
Come out to our first event of Hallo-week! SAC Movie Night: Fantastic Four will be playing in the Atrium at 9pm on 10/27/15
guess I'll make this terrible life choice and watch the new Fantastic Four movie.
No, no, no!! This latest attempt at a Fantastic Four movie is all wrong. Do it again. Places everyone.
They should make another fantastic four movie
Unpopular opinion, but I actually liked the Fantastic Four movie. (/ω＼)
The Fantastic Four movie from 1994 is making me question my sanity and everything I ever knew and believed about the world.
I don't know how anyone with millions of dollars to spare can make as bad a movie as Fantastic Four
Let's do crack and illegally watch the new Fantastic Four movie.
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/wyod801-rvQ?a  Fantastic Four (2015) Movie Review/Rant (NigelisAwesome!!!)
So, ultimately the 2015 Fantastic Four isn't a BAD movie; it's biggest problem is that it's very un-fantastic. #Fant4sticTweetUp
I'm happy about everyone clearly ignoring the existence of the new Fantastic Four movie

Sorry I had to angry tweet Micheal b Jordan earlier I've just had a lot of anger built up about that shitty fantastic four movie
I'd rather sit through the Fantastic Four movie than go through another Nikki Bella title reign. #HIAC #DivasTitle #GiveLuchaDragonsAChance
I think if they incorporate Doom into the MCU it shouldn't be until the 2nd or 3rd Fantastic Four movie anyway. Seed him like Thanos
Or because he subjected our eye sockets to that Fantastic Four movie?
as much as fantastic four was hated as a movie, I'm still beaming at my son saying michael b. jordan is his new favorite superhero.
LOL Im glad I avoided that one. RT @evil_avatar: 27 minutes into the Fantastic Four movie and I'm bored out of my mind.
Who's actually seen the new Fantastic Four movie? Is is as bad as it's made out to be?
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/VVtIY1vFAP8?a  Fantastic Four movie review
I wonder how the new fantastic four movie is doing
Think I'm the 1% who didn't think the new fantastic four movie was that bad
About to watch the new Fantastic Four movie... it'll probably make me appreciate the last 3 hours a little more.
I believe at least one of the Phase 4 movies for the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be a Fantastic Four movie.
I know its not the same, but the new fantastic four movie snaps harder than the original
Would you rather watch the Fantastic Four movie or the rest of this Texans Game?
@GigawattConduit and if people still need convincing point them to the latest Fantastic Four movie.

@NatePeercy Ya it'll be Legion and Hellfire. A Fantastic Four movie will be in 2020.
It's not Fantastic Four but I did just get the movie rights to another catchy-named group of do-gooders pic.twitter.com/UuLjeJd93l
I'm not liking where Marvel's going with the next Fantastic Four movie. pic.twitter.com/Ciw2c5nlqI
Marvel got the rights to the Fantastic Four back from Fox. Hopefully they'll not make another movie for them.

If Marvel heard @jonlockcomics' idea for a Fantastic Four movie (3 Morgan Freemans & a young Cyndi Lauper) they'd make the deal with Fox.
I think we'll be ok if there's never another Fantastic Four movie
There has not ever been a good Fantastic Four movie
@LesClairvoyants @SuperHeroStuff I hope #Fox is going to do a movie based on the fantastic four one day
Why make another Fantastic Four movie when the last one was barely watchable in the first place?

So if Marvel Studios really does have the rights to Fantastic Four, they should forgo an individual movie reboot, do Avengers v Dr. Doom 1/2
The next Avengers movie will be about them rescuing the Fantastic Four from the abusive supervillain known as "The Fox."
@CraigSJ Marvel should turn the development process of the next Fantastic Four movie into a reality show called Project Unrebootable
Rumour has it that a new Fantastic Four movie could be released in 2020, after being brought back to Marvel.

I heard Marvel Studios was gonna reacquire the rights to Fantastic Four and package them & Hüsker Dü into one big movie.

I want to believe the Den of Geek report that Fantastic Four movie rights are returning to Marvel, but I need more than just one source
Fantastic Four works when it goes big. No "stop some guy with an RPG." "Problem" is, last movie to go that kind of big was Jupiter Ascending
I want Marvel to have complete control of X-Men; tv & movies. I think X-Men tv rights are too high a price for Fantastic Four movie rights.

Rumors flying that Fantastic Four movie rights are back in the hands of Marvel. Could it be so? Could it really be so?

A good Fantastic Four movie? Y: The Last Man on tv? Everything's coming up Milhouse.
Honestly I still don't really want to see another Fantastic Four movie even in the mcu, more exited if they got Doom and Galactus
If the "Fantastic Four movie rights back with Marvel" rumor is true, we could get Black Panther vs Namor on the big screen. *drools*

If Marvel are getting Fantastic Four back, I'd be really curious to see what Doom as a villain in a Black Panther movie would be like
Great news that Marvel are getting Fantastic Four back! We'll maybe see a good movie now.

Marvel gets the movie rights back to Fantastic Four. How long until Captain Marvel gets pushed back to make room for a Fantatic Four movie?
Oh shit. RT @denofgeek: Fantastic Four back at Marvel, movie planned for 2020? http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/fantastic-four/37372/fantastic-four-back-at-marvel-movie-planned-for-2020 … http://twitter.com/denofgeek/status/654627212046503937/photo/1pic.twitter.com/4cDiPudrUr 
@JamesHunt @WJMolinari I just think it's going to be great when they make a blockbuster Fantastic Four movie just to show off that they can.
Fantastic Four rumoured to be back at Marvel with new movie planned for 2020 http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/10/fantastic-four-rumoured-to-be-back-at-marvel-with-new-movie-planned-for-2020.html … pic.twitter.com/REz3THwKm1
NO PLEASE GOD NO!!! last one was appalling! Fantastic Four back at Marvel, movie planned for 2020? http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/fantastic-four/37372/fantastic-four-back-at-marvel-movie-planned-for-2020 … via @denofgeek
The failure of the recent movie was in no way pre-ordained by choosing the Cronenburg-esque direction. Fantastic Four-as-Primer would have
Fantastic Four 2015 was SUCH a bad movie that the only thing good about it is that it moved the needle on this harsh Fox/Marvel beef
Dear @Marvel: If the rumors are true and you're regaining control of the Fantastic Four franchise, please let me make the Doctor Doom movie.
Hope this is true, would love to see a Fantastic Four movie made by Marvel instead of Fox http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/fantastic-four/37372/fantastic-four-back-at-marvel-movie-planned-for-2020 …
@JamesHunt yay! marvel can make their own terrible fantastic four movie!
Big rumours that Marvel have the Fantastic Four movie rights back. That'd be great and LONG overdue.

I'm watching the original Fantastic Four movie on cable tv. Because I hate myself, I assume.
If they were to choose any MCU movie to establish the Fantastic Four exist in that universe it would be #BlackPanther.
30 minutes into this fantastic four movie and I wanna sleep
The new Fantastic Four movie is amazing.Like, how did Fox even manage to make such a horrible movie with a great director & cast. Incredible
Interesting that both mutants and the Fantastic Four, whose movie rights @Marvel doesn't own, are being excised from comics universe.
Did Marvel trade the X-Men TV rights for the Fantastic Four movie rights? I know Fox was trying that. Details of the deal out?
Philip Glass co-wrote the score to this year's Fantastic Four movie? Whoa. http://amzn.to/1Qu70xR 
#Legion from X-Men getting his own TV series. Yet we still live in a world where a decent Fantastic Four movie is unattainable.

Can someone direct me to where people are signing a petition to stop another Fantastic Four movie from being released.
#BadPlacesToPutAPenis Any Fantastic Four movie
I've only seen the first fantastic four movie once. I remember it being campy as well, but the story wasn't interesting at all.
Rise of the Silver Surfer was a fun, campy, science fiction story. I don't know what more people expect from a Fantastic Four movie.

They should definitely keep trying to remake the Fantastic Four movie until it gets more than 10% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Monthly reminder, fantastic four is awful. Probs the worst movie of the decade
@MaheshJagga Also govt is also silent on horrible box office disaster movie Fantastic Four
Dennys is still doing the Fantastic Four promotion even though the movie bombed

The new Fantastic Four movie is all shades of annoying!
Movie Day: Saving Mr Banks, Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Four Rise Of The Silver Server. Now Dolphin Tale 2
Almost every movie this year is flames besides Fast 7 and Fantastic four...... Fantastic four is a flop!!! O_o
When fantastic Four came out, I said I doubt I'd see a worse movie this year. Apparently Pan took this a challenge.
Just finished watching the Fantastic four movie, can't see why everyone dislikes it so much.
Fun Fact: The Incredibles are a better Fantastic Four Movie than any of the Fantastic Four Movies.
The only Fantastic Four movie worth watching is the Incredibles.
