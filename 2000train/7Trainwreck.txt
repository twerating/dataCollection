There is nothing the movie industry press loves more than a good trainwreck. If The Force Awakens was a disaster, you'd have heard by now.
Trainwreck is lowkey a good movie
yooooo John Cena in the Trainwreck movie tho
Addy- "have you guys seen the movie Trainwreck?" Lindsay- "no, is it a movie about your life?"
Watched #Trainwreck last night. @KingJames — best character/performance in the movie.
Watched #TrainWreck today... good movie! :) it was lazy day.
Finally watching "Trainwreck" with @amyschumer and OMG THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IVE SEEN ALL YEAR IM JUST CRYING
Hold the presses. The journalism movie is back. Last week's column if you missed it (and thousands do). http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/journalism-movies-back-in-vogue-truth-true-story-trainwreck-spotlight-20151127-gl5p37.html …
How they made a movie called Trainwreck and didn't ask me to make a single appearance is astounding
Just watched the funniest movie of the year #Trainwreck #hilarious!!! pic.twitter.com/iccdef1mWD
Trainwreck is the best movie how do people hate it
*end of the movie* Mom: "why was it called Trainwreck?" "Because her life was a trainwreck" "Oh.. I kept waiting for a train"
Trainwreck was not a good choice for family movie night. Abort mission, I repeat abort mission. *packs bags and moves to different country*
Best Comedy movie: The Big Short, Joy, The Martian, Spy, Trainwreck #GoldenGlobes
As to why men cheat, I believe Amy's Dad explained that well in the movie 'Trainwreck'
the movie "Trainwreck" accurately describes my friends and I.

The movie Trainwreck
Thank you @amyschumer for Trainwreck. After a long time I watched a movie without looking at my phone.
The movie Trainwreck is literally story of my life. I've never related to a movie so much as I do with Amy
finally watching Trainwreck.Why is this movie over 90 minutes? Why would any comedy need to be this long? Directed by Judd Apatow, of course
Julie Wicks there's a naked John Cena in this movie... He CAN NOT dirty talk roflmao — watching Trainwreck
fantastic how awkward my dad is about the movie trainwreck but he loved barnie on how i met your mother
Why am I just now seeing the movie Trainwreck?
@TChuck42 I was thinking of a different movie... You picked the right one! I went with Trainwreck on Saturday... B- at best
I'm literally in tears at @amyschumer and this trampoline scene in the #Trainwreck this movie was funnnnnnnnnnnnnny
the movie 'trainwreck' is FUNNY
That trainwreck movie was actually.... A train wreck Lebron trying to act
If your girlfriend tells you that the movie trainwreck is her life it's a sign.

God, I love this flick. Trainwreck Movie Clip - Colin Quinn, Devin Fabry, Carla Oudin - Gordon Tells Daughters http://youtu.be/0cCPQglG4FQ 
Trainwreck was not the movie I thought it would be. Essentially a rom-com sheep in wolf's clothing (see what I did there). Cute, not crass.
No greater feeling than knowing you've got the new @JuddApatow and @amyschumer movie at home. #Trainwreck pic.twitter.com/UEBiI6MSOL
Only problem I had with the movie Trainwreck is that @KingJames and @Amareisreal didn't get enough camera time
Dare I say Trainwreck was my favorite movie of the year so far?
Isn't Trainwreck like the perfect movie, hilarious, cute, sad, melancholy, sorta learny journey then hilarious again - I absolutely love it!
the movie trainwreck is an accurate description of how my life is going
@Saramarie382 easily the worst movie I've ever seen...even worse than Trainwreck...and you know that's saying a lot for me
Alexis is crying at the movie trainwreck
If you ever want to pee your pants laughing watch the movie trainwreck

Also that awkward moment where you realize Any Schumer made a movie about you in five years and it's called "Trainwreck"
@amyschumer you've been shit on by a seagull, you have 1 year to make a better movie than trainwreck or else my friends will come

Daniel Radcliffe deserves an Oscar for his role of The Dogwalker in Trainwreck. It's hard to be the star of a move within a movie.
What a disappointment. Trainwreck was the worst movie I've seen this year. John Cena was really the only funny part.
This is the best movie I've ever seen. #Trainwreck
Finally watched Trainwreck. Finally not disappointed in a @TommyOnTheSpot recommendation. Funniest movie I’ve seen in a very long time
Watched the movie Trainwreck it was aight
trainwreck is a cute movie
the best thing about Trainwreck is @KingJames and this movie has a whole lot of great things in it.
I shouldn't be so critical of the movie trainwreck. I mean it's just another boy meets girl, boy does something questionably consensual with
the movie trainwreck is literally me
pro tip: the preview for trainwreck on itunes is so long that there's no need to actually rent the movie
@udiii have you seen yourself in the movie Trainwreck? @amyschumer
The second half of the movie Trainwreck was a trainwreck. @JuddApatow strikes again.
The movie Trainwreck is FUCKING HILARIOUS !!!!! Trust me...
This #trainwreck movie is
"You don't know who #LeBronJames is?" OF COURSE I KNOW WHO IS. He was in the @amyschumer movie. #sports #trainwreck
Trainwreck is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time Amy Schumer is beyond hilarious.
Did not like TRAINWRECK. If Lebron James is the funniest part of a movie with Bill Hader and Amy Schumer, then that's a problem.
If anyone is wondering, Trainwreck is a great movie.

Trainwreck might be the funniest movie I've ever seen
That new Superman v. Batman trailer did NOTHING to quell my fears about the movie being a trainwreck.
Today's movie: Trainwreck. Pleasantly surprised!
. @amyschumer about to start the final act of #Trainwreck, this movie is great. The dialog is witty, funny, & punches you right in the sad.
i'm just hate-watching this trainwreck at this point and none of these actors should put this movie on a resume
@amyschumer I haven't laughed out loud from a movie in a long time ... Then tonight I watched #Trainwreck this movie is so perfect!
The title to the movie Trainwreck is perfect. Because the movie is actually a Trainwreck. #worstmovieever

Bill Hader is the best part of #Trainwreck so far. Not my style movie, but Bill is classic. #ScoreOnLeBron
Can we please have one movie where the narrative is not driven by a "broken" woman. I can't believe "Trainwreck" went there. Ugh!

I saw the movie Trainwreck last night & John Cena was in it... His character grossed me out.
'Trainwreck' is pretty much my entire love life in a 2hr movie.
The movie Trainwreck is a lot like the Miami Heat. Not enough Lebron James, too much Amar'e Stoudamire.
Trainwreck is a funny ass movie
@ElenaM52 I don't necessarily want to see this possible trainwreck of a movie but my love for Jesse knows no bounds and he looks amazing.
@aDefeatedVictor It'll be a trainwreck. They want to do in one movie what Marvel built over 10 years. @gameinformer @DonavonRiley
At 6:30 Soup and Sandwiches will be served, followed by Trainwreck movie at 7
Finally saw TRAINWRECK. Schumer is a star. Could’ve been 20 minutes shorter and had a less conventional 3d act, but such is an Apatow movie.
@ThatLukeTyler @amyschumer Love the movie #Trainwreck laughed so hard watching it.
My first thought after watching BvS trailer was that it was good that Amy Schumer's movie will lessen the use of Trainwreck to describe it
Just... Wow. This movie is going to be such a fucking trainwreck and I am going to enjoy every crushed car.
@LetItRide81 Trainwreck was a great movie
Good movie but WOW production was such a trainwreck like what the hell happen when working on it!
i cannot get over how many phenomenally bad lines are in the new BvS trailer. I love it. I cannot wait for this trainwreck movie
With each trailer, #batmanvsuperman becomes a whole different movie. What a glorious trainwreck.
No movie has ever spoken to me like Trainwreck. This is art.
after the trainwreck that was man of steel I'm excited to see how this new movie pans out

Apparently even the product tie-in peeps knew from the get-go that live-action movie was gonna be a trainwreck. https://twitter.com/ladydiskette/status/671002078517534721 …

Watching trainwreck with my mom--she screams every time there's a sex scene or a cus word, which is basically the whole movie.
So we're the Daniel Radcliffe dog-walking pics from Trainwreck or is the movie in Trainwreck just making fun of the pics? #help

Trainwreck is my fav movie
The movie Trainwreck literally describes my future

Finally saw Trainwreck. Not just a silly movie, but great story and acting all around, even @KingJames ! Great job @amyschumer more to come!
Trainwreck is a good movie
I really thought TrainWreck was a super-hero movie.
So you've all seen Trainwreck. That movie is about me, you know the whole pre-Aaron part. Me since sophomore year of college.
trainwreck is quite possibly the cutest movie ive ever seen
Trainwreck is probably my new favorite movie
I want to go to bed. This Trainwreck won't stop. It's like a Michael Bay movie. I don't have to watch it, but it's so fun to watch it fail.
the movie Trainwreck is hilarious
I swear the movies trainwreck is probably the funniest movie I have watch. @amyschumer is soo hilarious!
This movie 'Trainwreck' wears its title well. It's all over the place horrible. Lawd, it's terrible!!
"And you took your MOTHER to this movie?" -my dad to my mom about Trainwreck
@KingJames @amyschumer finally got to see #Trainwreck love it! Only issue that #ColinQuinn is the Dad #feelingold but great movie!
Watching Trainwreck. It's a pretty great movie.
Family movie night, wife both kids & morther in law. Started with trainwreck. John Cenas naked thrusting was where we stopped.
9 minutes into the movie Trainwreck, and it's a pretty accurate comparison of how my life is going rn
Trainwreck is such a funny movie
my family picked a different movie over trainwreck....... done w these people
@ch0wzen she was on a Comedy Central roast, she killed it. Way funnier than the entire movie Trainwreck, which I actually haven't seen.
trainwreck is the BEST movie
Me: We watched trainwreck last night.. @amwalterscheid : OH the movie w/ JORDAN LEBRON! Uhh you mean Lebron James?
"So she's a trainwreck because he was a trainwreck? This movie is totally me, 5 years ago." --my sister on daddy issues
trainwreck is a hilarious movie
Trainwreck is THE funniest movie I've ever seen in my life
Saw Trainwreck- Lebron took that movie from a 7 to a 9, I'm probably the second funniest person to go to Towson after Amy Schumer. 9/10
Trainwreck is by far the funniest movie and most relatable to my college experience even with the name itself
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/l1t4UYvdfAo?a  Trainwreck Movie CLIP - Mark Wahlberg (2015) - Amy Schumer, John Cena Comedy HD

Finally watching #Trainwreck with @amyschumer. Hilarious but it might never end. How long is this movie?
Hubby suggested we watch #Trainwreck & I'm like "you want to watch me get drunk??" Then I realized he was referring to a movie...
@annettee_rae I just watched trainwreck. it was like watching my own life unfold in a movie
Lain bought me the movie Trainwreck. He's LITERALLY the best.

In TRAINWRECK there is a fake movie called “The Dog Walker” with Daniel Radcliffe & Marissa Tomei. The fake movie’s purpose is questionable

My mother on Trainwreck: "Is this movie all about sex? I thought there was a train involved."
Trainwreck was the wrong movie to watch with my grandparents
Watching trainwreck with my mom and her mom funniest movie dude

S/O to Angel for recommending Trainwreck, this movie is hilarious
@friendslikeus10 Marina, I saw you in the movie " Trainwreck ", Congrats !!!
This movie Trainwreck is not funny. It's so awful
if the movie trainwreck doesn't accurately describe my life, I don't really know what does.
I have to admit, @KingJames killed it in Trainwreck. Surprisingly very funny and probably one of my favorite actors in the movie. Natural
my dad- what movie are you watching me-Unbroken, it's about that olympian who was a POW in WWII my dad-oh you should watch Trainwreck
I think the movie Trainwreck literally helped get me and my boyfriend back together after 2 months apart. Thanks @amyschumer

Just watched Trainwreck again. I stand by my previous statement. @KingJames is the best part of that movie.
I just read a 1 star review of Trainwreck that said "it's like a Woodie Allen movie, but lacking the humor and genius"
My mom: "I wouldn't call you a trainwreck, but you're definitely @amyschumer in that movie of hers. So kinda a beautiful wreck." Thanks ma
@FunkyreFresh @2dAmMuslim @GoodOldWM I can't imagine that anyone involved in that trainwreck had ever seen a movie.
if they made a movie after my life i would want to be played by jack black bc his acting is almost as bad of a trainwreck as my life.

Trainwreck is such a weird movie
Trainwreck is not a good movie and Amy Schumer isn't funny

@amyschumer watched Trainwreck last night, funniest movie ever, my husband and I talked about it all day. Amazing, do another movie please!

Just watched Trainwreck. Really funny, but the direction/editing was rather indulgent for an Apatow movie. Tonal swings galore.
Trainwreck is seriously thee best movie ever made. #imdying #amyschumer
Done editing for the night. Curling up to watch a movie. Trying to decide what to watch... Right now it's looking like Trainwreck.
The girl from trainwreck looks like will Ferrell. It's distracting. Still a funny movie lol
Finally watched Trainwreck. And I was more excited to see a friend who dances for the Knicks in the movie than anything.
So Trainwreck, as it turns out, is not the best movie to watch with your parents.
Booze, chocolate, and the movie Trainwreck go pretty well together @_DANABRAGG
The movie Trainwreck predicted its box office failure by naming it train wreck. Amy Shumer looks like a r-rated cabbage patch doll
We got a new tv and our first movie is Trainwreck. Not even 1080p. pic.twitter.com/1zpnDLJNvM

I'm on the fence about seeing the movie Trainwreck
Watching #Trainwreck and all I can think is, "How the heck did LeBron have time to film this movie AND play in the championships?"
Trainwreck is a fucking hilarious movie lol
Movie #Trainwreck. 3rd time seeing it, still awesome: "You don't want to end up with Best-sex guy. Best-sex-you've-ever-had-Guy is in jail."

Keirsten and I are watching Trainwreck and holy crap it's the best movie I've seen
Best scene in the movie Trainwreck was the surgeon almost operating on the wrong knee. #BeenThereDoneThat
most impressive thing about TRAINWRECK is that they made a two hour movie about a sports med doc without ONCE using the word ‘orthopedist'
But hey, takes guts to call your movie Trainwreck, and it takes major guts to name a bad movie Trainwreck. Kudos to that at least.
Should've known a movie called Trainwreck wouldn't be any good. I guess the joke's on me then.
The movie Trainwreck is my forever relationship goals. No joke. That's it. Always.

trainwreck is literally the FUNNIEST movie @amyschumer is my spirit animal
@RationalMale @dcllive1 Just saw that movie Trainwreck and it was AWFUL. Aside from the morally reprehensible plot, it wasn't even funny.
@seanCduregger All TRAINWRECK did was prove John Cena and Lebron James deserve their own spin-off movie together. #GayForNBA
Watching #Trainwreck with my fav bottle of red, I see why my colleague told me this movie reminded her of me. #yikes pic.twitter.com/3mXLfInmh4
TRAINWRECK (cont'd): Hader is the best actor in the movie, Schumer is good but I think I would rather watch her standup stuff.
TRAINWRECK isn't a movie. Just a bunch of relationship sketches strung together. Watch WHEN HARRY MET SALLY instead. It still holds up.
Trainwreck is such a good movie
TRAINWRECK: very funny but barely a movie. Too long and the never ending string of unnecessary cameos are more distracting than helpful.
Trainwreck was probably the worst movie I've ever seen
#"Trainwreck"I really thought it was well written and well acted-I have a thing for Bill Hader-who can resist a Judd Apatow movie-So Cute!!!
Trainwreck is a pretty good movie. Standard rom com narrative arc, but enough extra touches and the gender stereotype swapping are great.
Laurelhurst Theatre gets another mention: http://sch.mp/0A4fds  - RT @kronda Trainwreck was a surprisingly entertaining movie and Lebro...
The movie Trainwreck is so funny
One of the many virtues of #Trainwreck is that it's likely the only movie ever to include the credit "with Tilda Swinton and LeBron James."
Trainwreck is my new favorite movie. Omg yes. I love Amy Schumer.
Trainwreck was a surprisingly entertaining movie and Lebron James is a good actor. (at @Laurelhurst Theater & Pub) https://www.swarmapp.com/c/fDKcoa5q2Ih 
@HouseofGlib Tilda's in Trainwreck?!?! I have GOT to see that movie!
Anyone else ugly cry when @amyschumer dances to Uptown Girl at the end of Trainwreck? Perfect scene from perfect movie
Main character in the movie Trainwreck....her last name was Townsend...I see what you did there
We just watched that movie Trainwreck and it sucked, it was just @amyschumer poorly executed attempt at being cute
Got the movie Trainwreck. May watch it here soon. Hope it's good.
Listening to Vicki talk about a guy reminds me of the movie Trainwreck
I am currently enjoying the movie, Trainwreck.

lauren kept falling asleep during the movie trainwreck so when she fell asleep I would hold her nose for a few seconds and she sprung up

Saw a film called Trainwreck last night ( nothing to do with trains) and it was the funniest movie I've seen in ages.
People keep saying the movie Trainwreck reminds them of me, glad to know my life has purpose
Also Trainwreck the movie accurately depicts my life.
Also saw #Trainwreck. Lebron James was funny but the movie needs a serious edit. Too long, bad script, lame jokes and an unconvincing ending
Has anyone out there bought Trainwreck or Vacation? If so you should hook me up with that digital movie code you're not using haha!
Trainwreck is just the best movie

WTG, @brielarson! Saw both #RoomMovie & #Trainwreck by @amyschumer - you rocked them! BTW, ty Amy for writing such a good movie! #actorslife
I got half way through the movie Trainwreck and decided that was enough... I dunno... just don't care
PSA: don't watch the movie Trainwreck with ur mom&aunt&uncle&cousin
trainwreck is actually a really funny movie
I just watched the movie trainwreck...with LeBron in NY...WTF CARMELINA WAS NOT AVAILABLE... #annoyed BTW great film
It's been a long time since Ive seen a really funny movie. @amyschumer, Trainwreck was hilarious. Well done & who knew LeBron could be funny
Trainwreck was one good movie. #RelationshipGoals
I was enjoying TRAINWRECK until it ... didn't end. How long is this movie? Are they going to grow old and retire?
Trainwreck is such a funny movie
Trainwreck might just be my favorite movie
Movie night w/hubs who said it was like watching his wife on screen. Sarcastic wino who wears cardigans everyday/likes metal. #Trainwreck
Finally watched trainwreck and loved it but idk how I feel about the fact I bear a lot of similarities to the main character in this movie.
Trainwreck is probably the funniest movie of this year
Just ordered #Trainwreck I've been waiting to see this movie w/ @KingJames . I hope it's good !!
Trainwreck is a train wreck of a movie. I really detest the condescending, high-brow Seth Rogan / Amy Schumer drudgery mistaken for comedy
trainwreck was the most awkward movie to watch with my parents
The movie trainwreck is such a on point depiction of my life and I'm not upset about it at all
John Cena in the movie Trainwreck
trainwreck is my new favorite movie #dontjudgemefuckers
OMG! Trainwreck is my new fave movie! @amyschumer is amazing!! I laughed and cried more that I have in a very long time.
Watching #Trainwreck and, holy shit, I cannot wait for that Amy Schumer/Jennifer Lawrence movie.
This is excruciatingly painful to say but Lebron was pretty damn funny in the movie Trainwreck, and kind made me like him .5% more
@SarahShoemake10 can't even pay attention to Trainwreck, but put a Christmas movie on and she's locked in.
John Cena's movie theatre scene in Trainwreck is preeeeeetttttty funny
Watched "Trainwreck". Didn't laugh as much as I thought I was going to but good movie in all. A crush on Amy Schumer!?! Me?!? Nah...
Ok, nobody told me Tony Romo was in this movie. *Fast forwards through his scene* #Trainwreck
My favorite part of Trainwreck is the movie within the movie about a dog walker, starring Daniel Radcliffe.
Other than him, the movie was an actual Trainwreck.
After Trainwreck I'll fire up my favorite movie, 50 First Dates. Hawaii and the most unconditional love ever.
Just got done watching #Trainwreck movie was funny af
@EmilyKennedy03 so my parents didn't quite get the movie Trainwreck. It's just you and me that thinks it's hilarious.
"Trainwreck" was definitely an aptly named movie. Cuz....that movie was a trainwreck. It's still on. It's so boring. And not funny.
Finally saw Trainwreck. A+ movie. Well done @JuddApatow & @amyschumer
Finally got around to watching #Trainwreck, what a fun movie. Good stuff, @amyschumer.
However the movie Trainwreck was awful. Amy Schumer somehow is even more annoying than Melissa McCarthy.
I am watching #Trainwreck and thought that @KingJames would have mediocre acting skills but #LeBronJames is the funniest part in the movie!
sunday movie marathooonnn ★ Trainwreck — https://path.com/p/18hgEK 
Watching this movie #Trainwreck & congrats to @kingjames for his performance. Actually looking forward to his scenes! You've come a long way
Trainwreck is not a movie to watch with your parents
Mom cried, dad laughed and brother didn't leave the room. I would say that's a pretty successful family movie. — watching Trainwreck

Watched TRAINWRECK again and I really love this movie.
trainwreck is literally the funniest movie I've ever seen oh my god
Trainwreck is seriously the funniest movie
So the movie Trainwreck is basically the same as Never Been Kissed.
I think @amyschumer's speech about her dad in #Trainwreck may be one of my favorite movie moments ever
Just bought Inside Out and Trainwreck; Solo movie night tonight
Trainwreck is a dope movie
We're watching Trainwreck for family movie night
trainwreck is legit the funniest movie ive ever seen
Trainwreck is a hilarious movie and if you haven't seen it, you really should. Preferably with a group of friends. Laughter is contagious.
Desperately needed a distraction tonight. #Trainwreck was the perfect solution. Thanks for the laughs, @amyschumer. Great movie.
Loved the movie #Trainwreck but why is @Lesdoggg only know as "Angry Subway Person" #MoreCredit

Trainwreck held up perfectly upon a third viewing. Side note, it's apparently my grandfather's favorite movie of the year so far.
just finished "trainwreck". funny movie... but i was a little disappointed with its overall lack of locomotive destruction. :/
The movie #Trainwreck is hilarious! I am just going to assume @KingJames & @JohnCena are that great in real life!!
Trainwreck with @amyschumer is massively hilarious. My loud obnoxious laugh continued throughout the entire movie. LOVED it.
The movie Trainwreck was a lot funnier before Amy expedited her 15 minutes in real life.
Never mind! The Wedding Ringer was the funniest movie I've seen this year. Then it would be Unfinished Buisness and then Trainwreck.
I'm watching that Trainwreck movie with my friends and I gotta fake laugh at every one of Amy's jokes. She's so trash.
Rewatching #Trainwreck and the fact that "the boy is mine" is in this movie makes 13 year old me so happy. Cc: @amyschumer @4everBrandy

Damn. #GoStars! Thought about @amyschumer #Trainwreck movie. Women train wrecks? Cute. Men? Horrifying/sad. Anyway. Back to the games.
This Trainwreck movie is hilarious!
Trainwreck was a bad idea for family movie night... Key word family
Watch Trainwreck tonight with @ttusub & visit Sam’s Place in the SUB to get all your movie snacks! @EatAtTexasTech
Amy Schumer movie is basically a Melissa McCarthy movie only the main character pretends to think she's hot. #Trainwreck
99.9% sure the movie Trainwreck is about my life
John Cena’s scenes in Trainwreck are over and now I’m sad. He ruled. He’s been the best part of the movie so far.
This movie... Is a trainwreck. -my thoughts on the movie Trainwreck.
I hope the Warcraft movie is a trainwreck and not just mediocre. I will only accept very good or extremely bad.
And now, movie date w the best bf ever! #trainwreck #cuddletime #bdaygift
Trainwreck literally made John Cena look like a complete idiot, but what a funny movie!
Tilda Swinton in #Trainwreck is one of the funniest characters I've seen in a movie in ages.
And the star of #Trainwreck... one of these movie titles is an accurate description of the other...
Got drunk and ate pizza with a friend while watching #Trainwreck, here's to you and your amazing movie, @amyschumer
Watched that Trainwreck movie with Amy Schumer just to see what the fuss is about her really, shes pretty cool but wasnt a great movie tho
"Trainwreck" was hands down the worst movie I've seen, ever
Beat the weather w/a new release movie! #Trainwreck, #MrHolmes, and @Terminator Genisys are available ON Demand. pic.twitter.com/v98KvDs7z9
Trainwreck is a great movie - see it if you haven't. I saw it in the theater with Robbie and now we are watiching... http://fb.me/4TtRWzZNS 
THIS WEEK'S NEW RELEASES -Amy -Better Call Saul Season 1 -Mr. Holmes -Terminator Genisys -Trainwreck

We finally caught up with #Trainwreck tonight. It's a funny good movie and I heart The Schumer.
Commenting thought out the Trainwreck movie, starting now

Peoples Choice Award nominations are out. “Trainwreck” is the favorite for Best Comedy Movie. It’s based on Jeb Bush’s campaign.
Trainwreck was such an awful movie. Literally felt like Apatow was asleep at the wheel. I don't understand why it got such good reviews
"Have you seen that movie Trainwreck? I haven't but I feel like that's you." Not offended.
I tried to watch that "Trainwreck" movie yesterday but Amy Schumer face annoys me
A favourite quote of mine from the movie, Trainwreck http://fb.me/1Wo6bGe14 
Movie: New on DVD/Blu-ray: Amy Schumer Is a Trainwreck, Schwarzenegger Is a Terminator >> http://bit.ly/1HJL3FQ  #film
"I don't know what this movie is" my wife's spot on review of Trainwreck.
As much as I wanted to continue watching the movie Trainwreck.. Naumay ako sa pwet ni John Cena.. #paorderngachara
The movie, Trainwreck, is literally my life. Lmao like all the way down to the drinking part
saw that movie with LeBron James and some white girl. #Trainwreck
Trainwreck was seriously such a GREATTTT movie
Trainwreck is a great movie
Also, watched the movie "Trainwreck",and have to say, I didn't like it. The jokes were so bad, even if guys were telling them, they were bad
Just saw Trainwreck what a bizarre movie
trainwreck is the funniest movie ever
#Trainwreck was kinda terrible as a movie. When a WWE wrestler is the best actor in a film we're all doomed. Sorry schumer :(
Ok, so Trainwreck was pretty bad but LeBron's Cleveland pitch was hilarious. Actually he was probably the best part of the movie
Holy mother I just watched #Trainwreck and that's my new favorite movie. My belly hurts from cackling. @amyschumer you are my spirit animal
I can't wait to own the movie Trainwreck
Haha wow trainwreck this movie brings back memories I miss those times spent and memories just wished… https://instagram.com/p/9-Nx5CQgZO/ 
Yup... I guess I really do cry during every movie. Add #Trainwreck to that list. #crybaby
Trainwreck might be the funniest movie I've ever seen
Trainwreck is such a good movie @amyschumer
John Cena's scene in the movie theater is still one of the funniest things I've seen all year. #Trainwreck

TrainWreck is probably my favorite movie atm.
Trainwreck had some funny bits. I don't get all the hype. It's still a movie where 1 person had 2 fundamentally change 2 make another happy
Trainwreck is kind of a terrible movie.
Trainwreck is a cute ass movie lol
john cenas acting is 10/10 would recommend in the movie trainwreck
When Kappa rents out a movie theater to watch trainwreck>>> #sisterhoodgoals
trainwreck is definitely my new favorite movie
Trainwreck might be the funniest movie I've ever seen
When you love a movie so much you watch all 3+ hours of its Bonus features. #Trainwreck @amyschumer
Amy Schumer is giving me an ab workout watching this Trainwreck movie lmao
Watching #Trainwreck. John Cena may be the funniest part about this movie! I mean who talks dirty in chinese!
I'm going to try & watch Ant Man, Trainwreck, Inside Out, Amy, & The Gift this week. Maybe Final Girls too. Been slackin' on movie watching.
I'm not a movie guy. Haven't been to theater in 15 years. Must say though, LeBron is crushing it in Trainwreck.
a bottle of wine and Trainwreck with my bestest friend!! @jordantoskes laughing our asses off already hahaha this movie is life
I think that Trainwreck is my favorite movie
trainwreck is such a good movie
@WWETaeTae I got the movie Trainwreck and here John Cena and his ass. pic.twitter.com/qEzlLCXCwD
Amy Schumer's movie Trainwreck speaks to me on a deep emotional level and it concerns me

So tempted to go buy the movie Trainwreck after work and then watch it all night while being in denial that I have school tomorrow.

What the hell is wrong with me, the movie "Trainwreck" made me cry?!!! Yes, I'm late to the party @amyschumer !
Watching #Trainwreck ...the movie, not the #GOPDebate even though that could be the title for both.
I'm halfway through Trainwreck, and this movie is hilarious. So funny. Amy, Bill Hader, and LeBron are amazing.

Today someone asked me if I have seen "The funny Amy Schumer movie, Trainwreck?" Funny and Amy Schumer do not belong in the same sentence.
@SpotterBrett Trainwreck is worth it. A little older, but I'd also recommend Tom Cruise movie "Edge of Tomorrow"
The answer is yes. I will be buying the movie #Trainwreck tomorrow because of the simple fact LeBron is in it.
So the movie "Super 8" is a movie about a trainwreck that released a monster. My ex was a monster that's a trainwreck. Thinking she shud sue

Real impressed by TRAINWRECK. Maybe Apatow's best. Big step up from Knocked Up 2: My Wife & Kids. Did he go to film school in-between
So John Cena and Lebron were freaking fantastic in Trainwreck. Why is that one the only movie that seems to get non-actor parts right?
"Why did I get married" is a trainwreck of a movie. But that dinner table scene is the funniest shit Tyler Perry has ever done

Watching Trainwreck. Holy crap, this movie goes off the RAILS in the 2nd half.
If you mixed How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days & Fever Pitch and took away 99/9% of the comedy, you'd have Trainwreck. That movie was a bummer.
Trainwreck refers to the Amy Schumer movie. Oh, its the name of the movie, too https://twitter.com/TrainwreckMovie/status/656554747445407745 …
@CrystalDianne97 trainwreck is the movie for you. John Cena is basically in the first half.

My movie of the year so far still between 'Beasts Of No Nation', 'Mad Max', and 'Trainwreck'.
#Trainwreck not just a new movie, it's also #Texans season
Trainwreck is a really, really funny movie. And LeBron James is hysterical
I was really hoping this movie become like TrainWreck but just PG verison #BooYork
Trainwreck is far from the funny, smart, feminist movie I was expecting. Just really really poor.
I'd rather watch the opening scene of Trainwreck 1000 more times than sit through the whole movie one more time.

Quote of the day by my Grandma after seeing the movie #Trainwreck... 'Well, that didn't have anything to do with a train!'
NO we don't have Trainwreck yet, but we can offer you a movie with an actual trainwreck in it, if u want
This "laugh until you pee your pants" Trainwreck ad needs to go away. I think I laughed twice during that movie.
I watched Trainwreck last night, and like any Judd Apatow movie, it was both way too long and very entertaining.
Ok I'm gonna watch this movie trainwreck I'll see y'all later
