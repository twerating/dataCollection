Relationships are like the movie Simon Sez. There's laughter and tears, good times and bad but it all ends in a fistfight w/Dennis Rodman.
Oh shit Simon Sez lol I actually like this movie
I'm upset that the 1999 spy thriller "Simon Sez" isnt a prequel to "Demolition Man". It's instead a bad movie w/ Dennis Rodman and Dane Cook
Simon Sez is an action movie starring Dennis Rodman and Dane Cook and no I am not lying it is 2000% real.
Starting the new year with a movie. Oh, Simon Sez, a 1999 movie starring Dennis Rodman and Dane Cook is on? That'll do.

This Dennis Rodman Simon Sez movie is so hilariously bad, I'm in tears......s/o to HBO for playing this classic
There's at least a 40% chance that Kim Jong-un's favorite movie is SIMON SEZ, right?
Wondering how long before U.S. movie theaters are only allowed to show the 90's Dennis Rodman classics "Double Team" and "Simon Sez".
If #sony agrees to make a @dennisrodman movie, will #NorthKorea let us see The Interview? Simon Sez 2 anyone? http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168172/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_13 …

Theres a real movie called Simon Sez with Dennis Rodman & Dane Cook as secret agents. How did this not win an Oscar? pic.twitter.com/HQ1ZMyQMVX
Simon Sez with Dennis Rodman is a movie that should have never ever been made lmaoooo. Or they shoulda picked somebody else to star in it
The fact that Dane Cook and Dennis Rodman did a movie together is still hilariously dumb. "Simon Sez" is probably the worst movie ever made.

Oh and on another note I was up early this morning and saw the movie Simon Sez starring Dennis Rodman and Dane Cook.
If you wish there were a 4th Bourne movie, just watch Simon Sez, and pretend tha Rodman is Damon, and Dane Cook doesn't exist. And squint.
Ok watching the Dane Cock movie Simon Sez, what a great american classic! Pirate!

Simon Sez w/ Dennis Rodman & Dane Cook is quite possible the worst movie ever made, but I cant help but cracking the F up at Dane
Shitty movie Sunday: watching the second Hot Shots! after the first one. Hey, it's better than Simon Sez w/ Dennis Rodman and Dane Cook.
Move over "Simon Sez" because "Running scared" is now the worst movie I've ever seen.
