daniel radcliffe loves dwayne the rock johnson and the movie san andreas i think that they plus hayley atwell need to do a film together
@finchlynch RIGHT?! That was my immediate assumption. Biggest let down since San Andreas not being The Rock in a GTA movie.

Word of advice: Never watch a movie like San Andreas bc the very next morning there might be a massive thunder/lightening/wind/hail storm

@Dena_Beth Fun chatting. Happy for your Bears. Going to watch a movie with the kids. San Andreas. Looks interesting.

This San Andreas movie is so predictable. Everyone dies and The Rock bench presses his way out of situations. #moviefacts
San Andreas. Not the movie to watch for someone like me who can't help but turn the living room into an MST3K episode.
San Andreas is just about the worst movie I've seen. It's 2015, and the special effects look like they're from the 90s

San Andreas is an extremely exaggerated movie. Specially the chasm. Movies tend to exaggerate anyway.
Just watched San Andreas, good movie & worth a watch.
The Rock’s character in SAN ANDREAS spends the entire movie stealing various types of vehicles.
San Andreas is such an intense and emotional movie that seriously made me cry the whole time

Though I was at times moved and shaken while watching the events of San Andreas, ultimately I have to say that the movie has many faults.
