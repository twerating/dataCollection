The Departed is an absolutely amazing movie.
The Departed is easily my favorite movie
“ @TVSecrets: The Departed pic.twitter.com/a2woOig4gp” Thats why this is the greatest movie ever
The departed is the best movie, I swear. Between this and Wolf of Wall Street I don't know how they haven't given Leo an Oscar
The Departed might be the craziest movie I've ever seen in my entire life
I just turned off The Departed for a movie bout A Bee
Lit Movie : The Departed
I'd love to see a movie where characters from SPOTLIGHT, THE FIGHTER, THE TOWN, & THE DEPARTED all interacted with each other at a Sox game.
The Departed is just a good, good movie.
The departed was such a great movie
I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat as much as The Departed
The Departed is a fucking twisted movie.. Old I know, but what a fucking plot twist..
The Departed is on, forgot how good this movie is.
The Departed is prolly my 2nd favorite movie after The Shining
The Departed RT @derekt529 What's 1 movie you could watch every week for the rest of your life?

Flashback of the day: Matt Damon after getting shot in the face by Mark Wahlberg on "The Departed" movie set in... http://fb.me/OcGwQdDd 
The departed movie last night taught me what to do, should someone steal my identity... Just kill everyone. Everyone lol
@pdicaprioFP911 OMG, I was thinking if the movie "The Departed" - he's got yo be alive, but he's got a weird link with afterworld...
The departed is the craziest movie I've ever seen
Few times a movie has gotten me as excited as when Marky Mark pops off Matt Damon at the end of the departed
After a movie marathon that included Alan Arkin in Little miss sunshine & Jack Nicholson's the Departed... https://twitter.com/vice/status/673903707621314561 …
I gotta check the Oscar Noms when Leo had "Shutter Island". Leo deserved an Oscar for that movie and "The Departed".
I fell asleep to the end of The Departed last night. That movie never gets old.
That's one movie I'd NEVER forget. Wyclef's soundtrack still rings in my head years after. May the departed RIP. https://twitter.com/Echecrates/status/673737206024966145 …
@Chatia12 @JonathanYMusic @LyleMcDouchebag it's really just the movie The Departed in animu form
Fuck off The Departed is still my favorite movie
Watching The Departed. swear everyone in this movie could get it.
Just watch the movie "the departed" on HBO.. My mind is blown to bits..
The Departed is such a great movie I love Scorcese
When Marky Mark bucks Matt Damon in the face at the end of The Departed, that might be my favorite movie ending of all time.

Watching The Town. I love this movie, also The Departed. Both great Boston movies!
I've declared my love for The Departed about a 100 times but like, seriously, such a great movie
Watching the departed.. this movie never gets old
The Departed..Great, underrated movie.. Leo and Jack scenes are off charts.
The Departed is the best Boston movie hands down
Swear every time I watch The Departed I trip out on Leo's performance. The emotional levels he went through in that movie are wild.
look i just turned off the departed for a movie about a bee
Watching The Departed for the 87th time. Everyone brought their A-game for this movie, but OMG @mark_wahlberg. Had the best lines!

The Departed is such a good movie! Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson and Leonardo Decaprio all in one great film! Con or cop!?
The departed is the greatest movie of all time
The Departed probably has the best cast out of any movie out there.
Final stance on Christmas movies: anything can be a Xmas movie if it is your tradition. Watch The Departed, watch Elf, watch She's All That

I'm going to make a new Peanut M&Ms that's exactly how you want it to be, they already made that movie and it was called "The Departed."
If you've never seen The Departed you're truly missing out on a great freaking movie
I just turned off The Departed for a movie bout a bee. I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing, and weed.
The Departed probably has the most shocking last act to a movie I've ever seen
The departed RT @ChillJordan: Quote with the best Leonardo Dicarprio movie you've seen
Watching The Departed again! Damn, I know this movie by heart!
Depp's performance completely carries Black Mass. The rest of the movie was just a less potent, less thrilling version of The Departed.
Watching the departed with em means her quoting the entire movie while I sit on my phone
The Departed. " @AndreiDamane: 1. Movie that you could watch every other weekend, it's so good."
@officialCelebV I'd say those are Leo's best performances, but probably best overall movie is either The Departed or Wolf
@smoakingbennett you don't like the departed? That's my fave Leo movie
One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest is my favorite JACK NICHALSON MOVIE...The Departed is my favorite movie JACK NICHALSON IS IN

@BaileyJayTweets The Departed is actually a remake of that movie
The departed is a dope ass movie
I watched The Departed for the first time today. I now have a new favorite movie
Good thing The Departed had it's initial cable run pre-Twitter. Such fun, but so many things wrong with this movie.
What if this is his version of the Boston accent Leo slips into in every movie since The Departed?
Started watching The Departed & now I'm bored. I can't sit through a full movie anymore.
The Departed is such a great movie. Scorsese can do no wrong.
The Departed !still a good movie
The Departed is such a killer movie. #BangaRang
>>> Academy members can take as much gore or sex or violence as you want if they love the movie. (see: The Departed, Slumdog Millionaire)
whoa there RT @Julz_b: I feel like not enough people give The Departed enough credit for being the greatest movie of all time.
@lutherpjay Goodfellas and Casino are light years ahead of the Departed. It's by far his worst gangster movie man.
The Departed RT @DrDreddyMurphy: RT this with the name of a Leonardo DiCaprio movie title that should've won him an Academy Award.
Both Bee Movie and The Departed are on HBO go. @lildickytweets #letmefreak

The Departed will never not be a great movie
. @MyTrackingBoard The more times I watch "The Departed" the less I think it's actually all that good of a movie to be honest... Major holes.

Are you ever in a mood to watch a movie where a lot of people die? Like can I watch the departed rn?
the departed has the best looking cast of any movie in all time
The Departed makes me wanna be from Boston so bad. Top 5 movie of all time.
Probably not the greatest idea to start a two and a half hour movie at 2 in the morning, but The Departed was a really really good movie.
The Departed has some amazing performances but there are MASSIVE plot holes in this movie. @TheKingsLaw was right
@maliciousglee @EpicKaitlin last night i watched the departed & thought of hayes & just laughed throughout the whole movie why am i this way
You finnin to be mad disappointed. RT @LRNROSE: for 152 mins the departed better be the best movie i ever seen yall

I really can't choose my favorite movie it's either the departed the wolf of wallstreet casino or goodfellas
It's so hard to limit clips for my presentation on the departed....can I just show the whole movie to my class? It's a damn masterpiece...

the departed is such a classic movie and will always be a favorite of mine.
The departed is a hard movie for me to watch because Leo, Marky Mark, and Matt Damon look literally exactly the same to me.
There is simply no movie cast quite like the cast of The Departed

@jennyjaffe the way you describe the Ewok movie structured is exactly how I watched The Departed thank you for putting that into words
I feel like @AlecBaldwin drunkenly stumbled onto the set of The Departed and they kinda just kept him in the movie.
Guess I'm gonna have to see "The Departed" with the rave reviews by @JohnFugelsang & @FrankConniff -- not usually my kind of movie genre.
The Departed as #TheMindyProject's ep title sounds like a cool thriller movie starring Denzel Washington cc: @loulielang @mindykaling

Why is The Departed trending? Lol actually it makes sense... Great movie
The Departed was an amazing movie
The Departed is a really good movie
Good movie "Black Mass" about James "Whitey" Bulger an Irish mafiso. In "The Departed" Jack Nicholson was Bulger.
Best Matt Damon movie is a solid argument. I am stuck between Good Will Hunting, The Departed, and Saving Private Ryan
The Departed will forever have the best cast/ending in movie history
#NW The Departed. Still the best movie I ever seen.
The Departed is the greatest movie ever!

The Departed is one fucked up movie man
@sandyjm12 Loved 'The Departed' I'll always go see a James Bond movie :-)
The Cleveland Browns remind me of the movie "The Departed." There's a rat in their unit. 3 different reporters with 3 different rumors.
The departed is a fucking amazing movie
I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee
I just finished watching The Departed and only two words can describe this movie: HOLY SHIT
The Movie The Departed Except Matt Damon Is An Anime Weirdo
The Departed is one movie that will never get old
*Watches Mets take 9-3 lead..... finds 'The Departed' on HBO2W ..... realizes once again the brilliance of the movie*
G'damn is The Departed a modern tour de force of cinema...20 mins in before the title of the movie even splashes, the cuts, the audio hits.
I'm watching The Departed now for the first time in a few years and holy crap this is such a good movie. Scorsese at his finest
I think The Departed might be my favorite movie ever just for sheer f word density and body count.
The Departed is my new favorite movie. Three of the most handsomest actors ever. #DiCaprio #Wahlberg #Damon
The Departed... such a good movie but I can't get passed all the flip phones. The technology holds up to an extent, but it's already dated
Currently watching The Departed classic movie
How did dicaprio not get the oscar for the Departed? In fact, the movie should have cleaned up. Its the best
I swear I can never get tired of the movie The Departed.
my weekend movie recommendation : "the departed".
Look, I just turned off the departed for a movie 'bout a bee.
Every time I watch The Departed I wish there was an alternate ending. Feels are always felt in the last 20 minutes. Amazing movie..

Watched THE DEPARTED again. That movie does not age well. The camera is asking for too much attention and it’s a total cheese-fest.

Haven't seen this movie in a while, but The Departed was a great movie
I didn't know Jack Nicholson was supposed to be Whitey Bulger in THE DEPARTED movie. #BlackMass
The Aviator, The Departed, Wolf On Wall Street. RT @sh6rk Leonardo is a great actor but really what movie did he deserve an Oscar for ?!
@sh6rk what eating Gilbert grape, basketball diaries , titanic , I forgot the name of that dream movie, the departed, wolf of wallstreet
If you want to watch a great movie, watch The Departed
I think I've watched the Departed on HBO like 12 times in the past week. Fucking brilliant movie .
@bexangell the departed was on last night. Can't turn that movie off.
For my money, the most potent movie moment of all time is the end of THE DEPARTED when a rat runs across the Boston skyline
The departed is a great fucking movie
@bnotserp bro the departed is actual the greatest car line-up and movie to ever be made its unfair to compare anything to it
@LSN_Frantz such a joke, The Departed was a lame copycat movie.
They gave Scorsese the Oscar for The Departed but not this epic Gangster movie. The Academy is a sham. https://twitter.com/complexmag/status/657161737318342656 …
The Departed is a fuckin great movie.. I'm upset im just now seeing it
The departed is the best movie ever, Lol i never get tired of watching it
The departed gives the shank and casino a run for their money as best jump into anytime time it's on movie
And I'm like look. I just turned off the departed for a movie bout a bee
The Departed may be the best movie of all time to be honest with you... All Star cast (Even though Damons a prick) great story line... A+
The Departed skyrocketed Leo's career. Yes, his best performance is definitely in The Aviator, but The Departed is a near perfect movie.
watched The Departed for the first time, a movie about Jack Nicholson having the time of his gross old life
The departed, casino, and now fury, the past couple movie selections have been on point
My favorite Leo movie is Shutter Island/Body Of Lies/The Departed / Blood Diamond / WOLF.
Movie night. The Departed.
Sara didn't want to watch the only movie there is (John Wick) so we're going to watch The Departed instead
The Departed is such a good fucking movie man

Can we also just take a moment to appreciate the amazingness of the movie The Departed? 10/10 movie. It would be 11 if at least Leo lived.
The departed will confuse you blacks. White actors all look similar... Great movie
Name one movie that was better than The Departed. I dare you. I double dare you.

Decided not to rent a movie but am rewatching The Departed. Great damn movie.
Mark Whalberg in the movie The Departed is most definitely my spirit animal
The Departed is my favorite gangster movie humor is delivered with so much energy in this movie and the senseless killings too.
The departed #weekend #movies another movie where Leo Di Caprio died. #spoilers
Black Mass, really good. Hasn't been a great Gangster movie since maybe The Departed. This fills the breach. Johnny Depp at his best.
the departed is such a good movie
Look, I just turned off the departed for a movie bout a bee
The only good movie ever made is "The Departed" but luckily for us it's fucking awesome.
The Departed is a great movie, except for the last shot. Might as well have been Dropkick Murphys dressed as Rats performing "I'm a Rat".
Showed my big sis the movie "The Departed" she never seen it. The reaction she got from it, is the right reaction.
Shawshank Redemption. Oceans Eleven. The Departed. Solid movie night.
@AriMelber Has it happened yet? The year "The Departed" won, Leo was nominated for a completely different movie. It might be box office, but
He's right RT @Aloha_Hoesss: Dont disrespect Blow RT @MaxinBetha The Departed > any other drug runner movie
The Departed is such a good movie, holy duck
The Departed is basically the movie equivalent to TTT
Watching The Departed on HBO. Awesome movie! @LeoDiCaprio killing it as usual.
Watching the Departed. Love Mark Wahlberg but don't love his hair in this movie. I could overlook it if he would just take off his shirt.
Haven't seen The Departed in so long that I forgot how good of a movie it is

So I very seriously wanted to get a lot done today, then The Departed was on, and you guys it's still a really really good movie.
The announcers compared the 49ers off season to a possible sequel to the movie The Departed... #ouch
Gee Al Michaels thanks for comparing our last year #NINERS to the #Departed movie which ended in a triple plus homicide..your point is ??

The Departed is an amazing movie.
"The Departed" is essentially the movie version of a late 2000s DJKhaled Posse track with a ridiculous amount of ridiculously famous rappers
The Departed is such a good movie.

The Departed is probably my favorite movie that is set in Boston. Good Will Hunting is a close second. Any other candidates?

That Black Mass movie is a must watch.. Still not better than The Departed tho
@xZacFolkx @theLowestTee he was saying the departed and goodfellas were terrible to me earlier also, so discredit him on movie taste.
The Departed might be the only movie that I like Matt Damon in. Maybe its because of Leonardo DiCaprio.
The departed is such a good movie 10/10 recommend
Watched The Departed again and I still hate Matt Damon cause of that movie
the departed is a badass fucking movie
Saw Black Mass last night. Johnny Depp was kickass but the rest of the movie seemed choppy and a like a low grade"The Departed". I mean, eh.
I've been sick in bed for 2 weeks, thank God there's been a #LeonardoDicapprio movie on once or twice a day,The Departed,Gangs of Ny,titanic
So Vivencio and Zaide share the same angles. This movie just reincarnated the departed nerd in me. Off to try again an old hobby.
Watching the departed this movie was good.
Forgot how good of a movie The Departed is.
Just watched Black Mass. Definitely a good movie but not a classic. Poorer version of The Departed, in my opinion.
The Departed is such a great movie. Def one of my all time favorites
The Departed is an AMAZING movie! I'm on the edge of my seat!
I just turned off The Departed for a movie about a bee
@KingHurd @Sean_Boog Tanya watched The Departed tonight so I can never with the Movie Game again...
The Departed is suuuuuuch a phenomenal movie...once you get past the terrible fake Boston accents, of course
I wish the Departed had done so before the movie started. https://twitter.com/AceofSpadesHQ/status/647587851589316608 …
Watching The Departed ... Excellent movie!!
Last time the Mets made the playoffs, you could have went and checked out "Saw 3" or "The Departed" at the movie theatre
I could watch The Departed everyday of my life and not get tired of it that's how great of a movie it is
I love The Departed. Top notch movie. For real.
I've seen The Departed like 65 times and the last 15 minutes are the best of any movie ever created.
If you want to learn how to edit watch The Departed. If you want to learn how to make a movie watch The Departed.Or just watch The Departed.
Look I just turned off the Departed for a movie bout a Bee, I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing, and weed.
The Departed is the funniest mob movie I've ever seen
Black Mass is a great movie if you're into "The Departed" type films. Super violent though.
Woke up and can't sleep watching The Departed! Great movie ughhh need to rest these eyes tho!! Lol
I forgot how crazy The Departed was. I love this movie.
The Departed is a wonderful consuming film. I love this movie!
I watched the departed tonight this movie is so fantastic this is one of my all time favorite films!
The Departed is such an amazing movie
Why did it take me so long to watch The Departed... what a great movie!
The Departed is by far the best movie of the last 15 years.
the departed movie gave me a hard on about having a flip phone tbh
Oh in case you are wondering in the movie the departed everyone dies
Mix American Hustle and The Departed and you get Black Mass. Depp is good but the movie wasn't nearly as good as The Departed in my opinion.
10 years late but the departed is a sick movie
#SchmoesKnow Definitely talk about The Departed. One of my favorite movies with Matt Damon and my number one favorite mob movie!

If you've never seen The Departed w Matt Damon, Leo, Jack Nicholson, and mark walhberg I highly recommend it. Damn good movie.
The Departed does one of my favorite things that movies rarely do: the title doesn't appear until like 20 minutes into the movie.
The Departed is the best movie I've ever seen.
The departed is my favorite movie man

Now I finally fully understand the movie "the departed"
OK after seeing Black Mass a second time, 8/10. I was hoping for it to be better than The Departed but no. Depp needed this movie lol.
Watching the Departed before bed now. This movie never gets old. Ever.
"The Departed" is such a good movie. Can someone explain to me how or why Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't have an Oscar?? Dude is legit!!
The Departed still a great fucking movie
I like The Departed. Not as much as I think most do, but it's a good movie. With that being said, the amount of profanity is A+++++++
Just caught the beginning of The Departed. Man I can watch this movie every time it's on. Gonna be a late night
The departed is a great movie. I am nawt a cawp.
If you liked Black Mass, just watch The Departed. Better movie.

The Departed has the best ending of any movie ever
Is processing Black Mass...to me, its Depp's best acting...expect he'll win Oscar...also feel its best Gangster movie since The Departed
Gotta actually watch that movie in one sitting to get a full grasp. From what I got though The Departed was good. #WatchForTheX's
I love the end of The Departed so much, excellent movie
Black Mass only made me want to watch The Departed again, best movie of all time.
I just turned off the Departed for a movie bout a bee
The departed is a great ass movie
I'll say it. The non-stop barrage of ads for the Whitey Bulger movie have certainly worked on me: I can't wait to watch THE DEPARTED on DVD.
@MercaderGaming the departed was a sick movie man. Really liked it. Good suggestion

Seriously, fuck The Departed. Bullshit waste of 3 hours with the fucking rat at the end. IT WAS NAWT A GOOD MOVIE.
I fucking love The Departed man. Such a great fahkin movie
Earlier I caught myself not changing the channel when Titanic was on. Oh I dont hate the movie but I swapped it for The Departed to keep Leo
I don't normally share my movie opinions on the internet but if you're gonna go see BLACK MASS just stay home and watch THE DEPARTED instead
@theworldofryan @dtmleach ah I see. I'm probably a little biased the departed is probably my 2nd favorite movie ever
The Departed RT @HitDaBoogieZ: Rush Hour RT @fmason3: Name a movie that y'all have to watch every single time it comes on TV?
I wonder if people would go easier on Black Mass if we all collectively accepted that The Departed is a pretty bad movie

Johnny Depp in Black Mass reminded me of Jack Nicholson in The Departed. Great movie!
Time to rewatch The Departed, haven't seen it since 2006 haha. I don't even remember the story plot but I know it was an amazing movie.
Updated All-Time Boston based movie list: 1. The Town...2. Black Mass...3. The Departed....4. Good Will Hunting
The Departed is my favorite movie ever.
Black Mass is a good mob movie, I'd probably put it above the Departed but under Casino
The Departed is such an awesome movie. Martin Scorsese is a genius.
@black__1202 nah dawg that movie his movie .. Watch the documentary he was a rat the whole time.. He the main character of The Departed
So is Black Mass just The Departed with real names? If it is, Ima grab the bootleg. The Departed was a perfect movie

A Career in politics is like a Career in #Cronyism. The Departed Movie.
BLACK MASS Review: The Departed is such a good movie.
The Departed has to have one of the best movie casts of all time.
Dude the departed got me fucked up. Damn good movie.
It marketed itself as a movie aspiring to be on par with something like The Departed or Goodfellas and it isn't in the same area code.
"Look I just turned off The Departed for a movie bout a bee" may be the realist line of any song ever
Movie of the day: the departed
My day is pretty much the movie the departed since I'm not getting any work lol
If I hadn't already seen: Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed then I'd be first in line to see the movie Black Mass. #OverKill
@JJKresl47 This feel horrible & real. The Departed (which I love) feels like a movie. I give the edge to Black Mass. Really glad you dug it
someone has to make another good mob movie, last good one was public enemy or the departed, which everone was made last
#BlackMass is a good movie. Not great. Good. Good Will Hunting and The Departed still rule the day.
Watching "The Departed" randomly. So much of the movie is really terrible. She's the worst shrink ever. And Nicholson can't escape himself.
@ScotteNixon The rest of the movie unfortunately can't keep up with Depp. This is not the equal of 'The Departed' but Depp is awe-inspiring.

idk why this was my first time watching the departed. quality movie
The departed is a great movie with so many twists
@briellleashley cmon Breh if you don't know that's from The Departed you really gotta step your movie game up
I will watch The Departed every time it comes on. It's about as close to perfect as a movie can get.
I don't like Matt Damon as an actor or any movie he plays in bc of the simple fact that he was the rat in The Departed. My favorite movie.
The Departed is my top 5 favorite movie. Black Mass will probably be on that list come Friday.
The departed is a good ass movie
Idc if I own the movie, anytime The Departed is on, I'm watching it..
If you're like me, the departed was a very confusing movie for me they all looked the same

@EndaEndamac95 Gonna be hard to beat Jack Nicholson's version of Whitey Bulger in The Departed. Great movie!!!
The Departed was such an amazing movie - although what do you expect with 4 of the best actors in it.
The bulk of ‘The Departed’ was filmed in New York City, even though the movie is set in Boston.
2am bedtime, courtesy of 'The Departed'. Dope movie.
@Lawrence @BlackMassMovie The Departed is my #2 favorite movie. Know it's VERY loosely based on Bulger. Think I'll like BM more? Skeptical.
THE DEPARTED is 10 years old and it's still stuck in my head. I can't watch a Boston movie and not think it falls short by comparison.
I want to see Black Mass. Even though they already made a movie about Whitey Bulger's story. It was called The Departed.
Don't ppl realize. The Black Mass movie is just a remake of The Departed
The Departed got me stressing cuz it got Wahlberg, Damon, AND Dicaprio in the same movie. They kinda blend together looks wise
I hate it when Netflix or television channels mention what year a movie originates from, it makes me feel old. (The Departed, 2006 for ex.)
I just recently watched The Departed. That was a dope ass movie.
The departed RT @TrillAC_: Godfather RT @derekt529: Name a movie you could watch everyday..

Watching the departed this movie is live!
The Departed is quite possibly the greatest movie ever

Retweeted Movie Quotes ( @MovieRelateable): "Who let this IRA motherfu**er in my bar?" -Jack Nicholson 'The Departed'
The thing about the movie the Departed is it’s pretty clear who the rats are on either side.
I just called The Departed "The Boston Movie." (No disrespect to Mystic River or Gone Baby Gone or especially Good Will Hunting).
pretty sure 'the departed' is my favorite movie. period. it's perfect.
@Clip275 fa real the story is super dope I think the tried to cover it in the departed but they made it to fictional, this movie is the 1
The Departed was a dope movie the irony of the rat running across the balcony in the last scene was clever
Bourne supremacy followed by The Departed? Movie channel beasting for once!
Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg in a Martin Scorsese directed movie is the reason why The Departed is absolute perfection
Can't believe I hadn't seen The Departed before. Great movie. *slow clap* for the genius that is Matt Damon.
Thanks to the movie "the departed" I always ask people if it's their period if they're drinking cranberry juice.

The departed was a solid movie. But not scorcese's best by far
The departed is the most stressful movie of all time
Some days it's hard to choose a movie to watch on HBOGo and then some days hey look The Departed is right there
The departed is an amazing movie
Holy crap, the departed is such a good movie.
Went from Frozen to The Departed to The Prestige to this Addicted movie..........slick boring me lmao some need to happen
the departed has 3 of my baes in one movie. it goes hard
It always bothers me when Dicaprio fanboys/fangirls have never seen The Departed, easily his best performance and best movie
Don't know why I never watched the departed before today, unreal movie
If I had to watch one movie over and over again, it would definitely be... The Departed #MoviesOnLoop
The departed is still such a good movie to watch but can't wait to see that new #blackmass movie to ️

@film_girl Ooh, I watched the Departed out to WWDC in June. Great plane movie.
I'm the worst Bostonian. I just watched The Town thinking it was The Departed. Got halfway thru before I realized its the wrong movie lmao.
The Departed is the greatest dumb movie.
The departed might have had the best cast ever on one movie
Can't complain about The Departed being on HBO right now. Awesome movie
But the departed is on. This movie is top 10.
Every single movie channel and nothing good on TV. Last night I watched Arachnophobia, tonight The Departed.
The Departed is such a good movie dude
So this movie The Departed is pretty good. You should watch it.

The Departed is seriously the best movie ever. Leo was robbed.

@DrZyphox The Departed. Watched it Saturday again for the first time in a while. Movie is TOO good
The Departed > Every movie ever
Why the fuck is the departed such a long movie?
The Departed may be my favorite movie, just because Mark Wahlberg kills Matt Damon.
The Departed is a top 3 movie all time
Mark Wahlberg headshotting Matt Damon at the end of The Departed will forever be one of the most gratifying movie kills of all time #footies
Saw that THE DEPARTED was on HBOGo. Hit 'play' just to remind myself how the movie starts. Watched the whole thing. Stayed up too late.
Yes. I love the ending so much RT @p0pson: Is the movie the departed good?
Yeah RT @p0pson: Is the movie the departed good?
The Departed is now on Netflix. If only that movie still had the magic it used to have.
Completing #Narcos inspired me to watch THE DEPARTED again. Calling this my 2nd Favorite Scorsese Movie.

The Departed is such a bad ass movie, I can watch it over & over.
@talkhoops Leo was so remarkably stressed out in that movie, it stresses me out just thinking about it. Time to watch the departed again!
look, i just turned off the departed for a movie bout a bee
I hardly ever admit to these things, but the shrink in the movie the Departed is in my opinion, gorgeous.
I really liked The Departed, and then I saw Infernal Affairs. That movie is so much better
Holy moly, #merufilm is a good movie but it is an emotional roller coaster. Think I'll chill out with The Departed or something now.
@maudegarrett YOU TOTALLY LOOK LIKE VERA FARMIGA from the movie "the departed"
The Departed still holds up as a great movie.
The Departed is an incredible movie
Black Mass looks like the best Boston movie since the Town and the Departed
In The Departed, Mark Wahlberg is better than both Caprio and Matt Damon. First rate movie, had been itching to see it again since long.
@joedarts317 The Departed is based on the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs. Personally I prefer this as the setting is closer to home.
The Departed is such a great fuckin movie.

@ChrisDanielShow best revenge movie ever the departed
The Departed. Matt, Mark and Leo in one movie.
Movie Black Mass looks so LIT, basically "The Departed" but just the true version of the story
@dpshow "Infernal Affairs" was a much better movie and it was the movie "The Departed" was based on.
For my 1st wish, I'd like to change the final scene of the movie The Departed to remove the photoshopped rat. No further wishes required.

@knelligan12 I'm thinking Infernal Affairs. Its the Korean movie The Departed was based on. Been meaning to watch it for ages.
INFERNAL AFFAIRS is not a very good movie. Everyone who called THE DEPARTED a soulless redo was wrong. The latter does every element better.

The Departed is always a good movie choice
The Departed is probably one of the best remakes of all times. That was Leo's Oscar winning movie right there.
The Departed may be my favorite crime movie of all time.

Jack Nicholson's opening Soliloquy in "The Departed" is some of his best work. Yes it's 2:39am. Yes I'm watching a 2.5 hour movie. #America
