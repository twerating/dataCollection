The Turkey Shoot needs to do "God's Not Dead". It's a hilariously stupid movie, and Kevin Sorbo is one of the worst actors ever.

Movie: Turkey Shoot (Brian Trenchard-Smith, Australia, 1982)
One more movie left - australian 80s sci fi splatterfest turkey shoot. Currently in the cinema watching aussie exploitation trailers.
maybe if Turkey Shoot was editied the way it's portrayed in NQH, I would have enjoyed it. That movie looks kick ass!
