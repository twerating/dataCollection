Minutes after NBC shows a graphic of Ben Roethlisberger's brain injuries, there's a commercial for the Concussion movie.

@Cooper_PV @JHOLLA23 @mradamscott I respect your opinion Ben, but we all know I'm not going to see a movie unless it's Death Blow.
Krampus might have been the single worst movie I have ever seen in my 18 years of living. Not kidding.

@Matt2Harrington I saw the theatrical trailer. That entire movie is making Batman the "bad guy". The director, and Ben Affleck, can die.
Honestly this new superman v batman movie looks like trash. Ben afflec just doesn't scream batman to me and lex Luther is black not white !
Should've just let Ben Affleck direct the movie. Zack Snyder is beyond trash. Even 300 is overrated.

Oh boy, this Batman vs. Superman trailer. It might just make me watch a Ben Affleck movie seriously. Goodness.
Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor makes about as much sense as Ben Affleck as Batman. That movie looks just as garbage as its premise.
Surprisingly excited about the new Batman vs Superman movie. Maybe the brooding stoicism is just right for Ben Affleck.
I don't care about Ben being batman anymore as much as I care about batman being in this movie at all. Let superman develop please.

Only reason I'm not so pumped about the Batman vs Superman movie is because it's Ben Affleck thats playing BatMan and nt Christian Bale

Ben Affleck ruins every movie he appears in due to him being made completely out of wood. #BatmanvSuperman
Two thoughts: 1) if you don't think Ben Affleck literally looks like Bruce Wayne then you're kidding yourself, 2) the movie looks very bad.
Hopefully the next Spiderman movie won't have an origin story. I'm tired of seeing uncle Ben dying and Peter Parker being in High School

New post (Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2015) Ben Affleck [Movie Trailer]) has been published on YardHype http://fb.me/3xTo2hPY0 
Last time I've seen Ben Affleck in a superhero movie was Daredevil and the kid actor performed better than him.
The thing that worries me the most about the new Batman movie isssssss Ben Affleck being batman
Prediction: Ben Affleck is a good Batman in a bad Superman movie.
@BitikoferAustin the movie is going to be awesome also, Ben looks great so far (although, I didn't doubt him in the first place)
All I can say is Ben Affleck teaching superman how to be a man would make a pretty good movie by itself.
The hype for the movie has died down significantly when I heard Ben Affleck got casted (￣O￣;) #BatmanvSuperman

@YoungBLKRepub i think ben may be okay,and im a lil excited for the solo movie cause its gonna be the under the red hood plot line
I have a feeling that the Ben Affleck directed Batman movie is going to be much better than Batman v Superman
y'all didn't like Ben in Daredevil? I thought that movie was pretty good.
Not sure how i feel of Ben Affleck as Batman... It's kinda putting me off the movie.. :/
@CelesteHookem I watch that movie like once a week AT LEAST
Douche movie-writers in Hollywood: "I'm all out of ideas." "Let's do Batman vs. Superman." "Get Ben Affleck on the phone ASAP!"
@CelesteHookem yes goals movie lol
I've never apologized for a tweet. You're outside of your mind if you think I'm going to start over a Ben Affleck movie.
Idk how to feel about Ben being the new batman. It just isn't the same. Like Christian bale should be in that movie!
I really can't see ben affleck as batman, however the movie still looks good.

Ben Affleck looks like he's doing a Batman Spoof not a movie smdh
Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne voice is fantastic. Anyone not looking forward to Batfleck can go kick rocks. Movie looks wonderful.
A nice thing about getting older is the memory starts to crap out so you can watch a trailer and forget it all by the time the movie's out.
You got some balls on you to call an alien a freak to his face. Then again Ben Affleck chin so big in this movie he can take the punch.
Batman movie looks absolutely terrible. Ben Affleck? Really? Nolan is ruining the movie so everyone looks back and thinks his are the best.
Christian Bale was apart of the BEST batman movie ever made & they put Ben Affleck on.... I just dont get it. Square chin look awkward too
I think I'll wait for the solo Batman movie which will be controlled by Ben Affleck

Ben Affleck and Jesse Eisenberg about to shit on niggas next year with that movie

I won't judge Ben Affleck's acting of Bruce Wayne yet, I will wait until the movie. What I do like is he's got the sarcasm Wayne has

Honestly. Have you ever seen a Ben affleck movie? Why would you cast him as the worlds greatest detective
@OhSpeedy @ben_alger @roycealger @FarterCrapple don't hate. That was a very good movie.
I've so successfully ignored the idea of Ben Affleck as Batman that I managed to also block out the premise of the entire movie. Huh.
@ben_alger @Cleve_age @roycealger @FarterCrapple Which you recommended to him because it's your favorite movie
This movie is going to be so goddamn epic. Ben Affleck is perfect. #BatmanvSuperman
Ben Affleck's Batman with Heath Ledger's Joker in a movie would've been perfect.
@d041feccd3db4fc I wonder that too. Wish he did though cause I can't watch the movie when it's Ben Affleck
Favourite Batman Adam West? Michael Keaton? Val Kilmer? George Clooney? Christian Bale? Ben Affleck? No....Will Arnett from the Lego Movie!
For the life of me I can't figure out why Matt Damon and Ben Affleck never wrote another movie together.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Official Trailer #1 (2016) - Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck Movie HD http://youtu.be/bha24P9uw-E 
Just saw the Batman vs Superman movie trailer, and it's going to be hard to take Ben Affleck seriously as Batman
Home alone might be the best movie of all time.
Wait, Batman is Ben Affleck AND wearing a Silent Bob trench coat? Does this movie crossover into the View Askewniverse? cc @ThatKevinSmith
A Ben Affleck movie ain't changing lives lol

In the movie "Learning to drive" Ben Kingsley is a Sikh immigrant in NYC who left India after being imprisoned & tortured for being a Sikh.

Leah - "tell me how the movie ended" *tells her Leah - "wtf Ben u just spoiled the whole movie"
@ben_towle I re-watched that movie for the 1st time since childhood a few months back. Took me a week in small portions. Never again.
The problem with Ben Affleck is that he is Ben Affleck. In every movie you get pulled out because you don't see his character, you see Ben.
I'd totally forgotten that Bane was in that Joel Schumacher Batman movie from the 90s. Maybe for the best. pic.twitter.com/YOOJEj3hYd

The disgusted look on Superman's face after he unmasked Batman to see Ben Affleck...but then I reserve my comments until I watch the movie.

Can the next movie I watch just be Ben Wishaw and Christoph Waltz hacking into stuff?
Obviously hyped for the Batman vs Superman movie, but still quite bummed that Ben Affleck is playing Batman and not Christian Bale :(
@ben_chaykowski I have a stellar movie collection, promise
Need a movie night with friends again, sometime soon
Ima have to see the full movie before I give Ben any credit

The new Batman vs Superman movie is gonna be worse than the Eagles and not because of Ben Affleck
The spongebob square pants movie is on Netflix
@snailsyd it was definitely in the Ben 10 movie and I was obsessed with it
I can't watch any Will Farrell or Ben Stiller movie. Both take retardation to new heights of stupid.
Where does the black makeup around Ben Affleck's eyes go when Superman removes his mask? Way to ruin another movie DC
I'm calling it. No matter the quality of the movie. Ben Affleck is going to be arguably the best Batman/Bruce Wayne on film.
@Eepots @soundofthegeeks THERES A MOVIE ABOUT ANDREW MCMAHON ON NETFLIX CALLED DEAR JACK "chronicles real life&death struggle.. W/ leukemia"
