Forgot to mention. I saw "Brooklyn" over Thanksgiving. Nice little movie about the immigrant experience. I recommend it.
Many meds and a viewing of BROOKLYN later, I'm feeling better. Damn, that's a wonderful, full-heart of a movie.
When you get way too emotionally invested in a movie. Good thing we sat in the back row away from people. Brooklyn was amazing @CinemaArts
Highly recommend Brooklyn (the movie, not the borough). Can't remember the last time I saw a film so faithful to the novel. #BrooklynMovie
Brooklyn is the best movie I've seen this year. I highly recommend. #BrooklynMovie

saw "Brooklyn" Best romantic movie I've seen in years. Beautifully shoot, beautifully acted. Highly recommend!
I want to see a movie about the construction crew that rebuilds the Brooklyn Bridge every time it gets blown up in all the other movies.
Colm Toibin has confided in me that he adores the adaptation of Brooklyn, but that Air Force One is still his favourite movie of all time.

Brooklyn is the first movie I've come out of in a long time that i kept thinking about it long afterward
Brooklyn - such a sweet & lovely movie. A superb example of using a gentle hand while storytelling & allowing the actors to shine.
Watched #Brooklyn in my local movie theatre today. Great #DateMovie. Or, in my case, something to do when no one's around.
Every American should go see the movie Brooklyn. Outstanding. And, timely.
Movie review: saw #" #Brooklyn" yesterday. Slow but rich & deep. A movie that deeply asks, "What/where/who = HOME?" Still pondering it 2day.

Loved Brooklyn. Great movie. Most impressive thing is Tony doesn't mention Shot Heard Round the World the entire movie
#Brooklyn was a movie about immigrants and a love triangle, yet I loved it. Maybe the most genuine movie I've seen this year.

Brooklyn (2015): 4/5 Great little movie! Compact and emotional. I love that it ends exactly when it should.
I'm about 45 minutes into the movie "Brooklyn" and starting to think this isn't the new Spike Lee joint.
I'm a little astonished at the high praise for Brooklyn. That movie is aggressively nice and boring.

Brooklyn' is a gorgeous movie. The magic is in the slower pace & close up shots of Saoirse Ronan in a nuanced, Oscar-worthy performance.

Loved Brooklyn movie almost as much as book BUT casual wine drinking not an early 50s thing &, as always on film, suitcases too light!
Severe movie backlog for me right now: Creed, Good Dinosaur, Brooklyn, Trumbo, Danish Girl, maybe Secret in their Eyes.
Thanks to the lady on my entire PATH ride I now know the entire movie synopsis of "Brooklyn." Happy Monday!

Six word summary of the movie Brooklyn: Fuck you guys, I love Tony.
Brooklyn was such a cute movie
BROOKLYN (the movie) is good and weirdly sweet, BROOKLYN (the imaginary toddler) is a little shit
@filmvibes I thought she was fantastic in Brooklyn and the movie is a sweeping crowd pleaser. I just don't see JLaw winning #2 yet.
Just saw the movie Brooklyn and I keep expecting to see everyone around me dressed in pastels and vintage sunglasses.
Brooklyn is maybe the most touching movie I've ever seen. I'm actually dehydrated from all the waterworks
Brooklyn will be half way thru a movie then yell out she don't wanna watch it no more. & make me change it bout 7 times.
Spoiler alert for the movie Brooklyn: sad ending -- the Dodgers moved
Freaked out when the same beach used for Shell Cottage in DH appeared in "Brooklyn." Of note: Go see the movie. So good!
Brooklyn was a really well made and well acted movie. Good plot. Makes you think about the meaning of home and identity.
@meghin_ I'm 95% sure Brooklyn is the best movie of the year.

Vampire in Brooklyn was on earlier and my entire night was made. I really do love that movie and New Jack City so much.
Loved every single second of #Brooklyn in a way I haven't loved a movie in a long time. Moving and beautiful in many ways. Highly recommend.
Why didn't you fuckers tell me Brooklyn is an Irish remake of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg? Goddamn. I loved this movie.

OMG, the super cute main guy from the movie Brooklyn (which was so excellent) is an NJB from Manhattan who is age appropriate. New fake BF!
Brooklyn is a deeply lovely movie irrevocably marred by the presence of Leo from Smash. I do not forgive, Leo from Smash. I do not forget.
The only thing I loved more than the movie Brooklyn is Saoirse Ronan IN the movie Brooklyn. She's...perfect.

The movie "Brooklyn": a very good one. One of those movies that reminds us of the harsh trivialities of life.
Everyone needs to go see Saoirse Ronan in the movie Brooklyn. Amazing movie! Visuals we amazing
I watched Brooklyn (the movie) tonight and had a glass a wine. I'm not sure how much more my heart can take.
I wrote such a good piece yesterday on the movie Brooklyn-and you're going to have to wait until tomorrow to read it. So prepare yourselves.
Sadly, as I suspected, no Brooklyn Cocktails in Brooklyn, the movie. Just Guinness, Lemon Squash, and a couple glasses of Sherry.

Emory Cohen stole the movie for me in ‘Brooklyn’. Such a great performance. Reminded me of Brando in Streetcar. Gonna be a big star.
See the movie ‘Brooklyn’ - I know it’s not going to be a huge blockbuster but go see it. It’s really good.
i just heard the spotify ad for the brooklyn movie and nothing makes sense
Finally watched the first Hunger Games movie and I'm obsessed I wish I had all the movies so I could watch them right now

Pretty sure the movie "Brooklyn" was made solely to be my favorite movie of the year and to make me fall in love with Saoirse Ronan.
Brooklyn was very sweet and incredibly well acted, directed and written. Just a great movie from top to bottom.

maybe brooklyn is the most hipster movie ever by not being hipster or ironic at all?!?!??!!??!? discuss, in an irish brogue.
thought Emory Cohen was movie-ruiningly awful in Place Beyond the Pines but he's great in Brooklyn, young Brando swagger, sweet & charming

On the blog: BROOKLYN, which is my favorite movie of its type since IN AMERICA, which I liked rather a lot. http://www.jaysmovieblog.com/2015/11/brooklyn.html …
Heaven forbid a film as insipid as Brooklyn wins any prizes. The Peanuts Movie has more richness and insight into humanity.
Finished reading 'Brooklyn' tonight. Never found myself quite as captivated by it as others did, although the movie looks good.
Odd juxtaposition: Brooklyn (the movie), and tonight's You're the Worst. They are bizarro compliments of each other.

I WANNA SEE THE MOVIE BROOKLYN
BROOKLYN is so good I can't even put into words. I had a big, dumb smile on my face the whole time. This movie is a treasure.
I'm sure they did a lot of hard work on it, but I don't need a Saorse Ronin movie to bring me back to a time where Brooklyn was white.

Brooklyn was a beautiful movie I don't get how Saoirse Ronan does it
Great movie weekend. 3 for 3: "The Peanuts Movie," "Spotlight" and "Brooklyn." Run. (Lifelong Peanuts fan. Ain't nothing wrong with that.)

Master of None is the inevitable Kevin Smith movie for 2015 Brooklyn instead of 1994 New Jersey, with twice the pretension & half the jokes
Wait wait wait. Wait. Leo from SMASH is a lead in the movie adaptation of BROOKLYN? And he's getting good write-ups? Good for him.

How ironic, the legal immigration movie Brooklyn trailer comes out during the Trump SNL appearance. Legal means when we followed laws
They really white washed the Italians in this new Brooklyn movie. 80% are southern Italians in America, and once considered colored/black.

Major movie drought for me right now. Havent seen one since BROOKLYN last weekend. Because what's the point of watching if it's not BROOKLYN

@IAmBlankenship The novel "Brooklyn" is magnificent that way; if the movie captures even part of that ...
#Brooklyn Wow! Brooklyn the movie is a perfect 10, a polished little gem of a film. Saoirse Ronan is utterly splendid. Oscar material.
Movie script awaiting John Travolta's approval: "Saturday Night Bingo". His roll will be the manager/caller of a Brooklyn bingo parlor.
