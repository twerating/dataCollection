"Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat" (2003) is a repugnant movie (F) #DallasCritic <nslchd>
Love this movie — watching Dr. Seuss' The Lorax
@zen_studios H.R. Giger, M.C. Escher, Sleepy Hollow, or any Tim Burton movie. Steamboat Willie, Dr Seuss, just pump out more and don't stop!
In the movie "true story" it says dr. Seuss is from Wisconsin and that there's a park with all the characters...............
