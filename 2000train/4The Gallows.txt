In summary of The Gallows- for all the movie's many flaws, I do find the culminating scene and subsequent denouement to be very well done
Saw The Gallows with Noah. That movie was messed up.
So The Gallows is the scariest movie I've seen in a very long time...
The gallows is a good movie
The Gallows update: the scares in this movie are not very intelligent or nuanced. it just jars you with loud noises over and over again

Horror movie buffs: The Gallows is just okay. The reviews say awful. "Found-footage" is becoming an excuse for low-quality visuals though.
The Gallows wasn't that bad of a movie. The first bit wasn't very interesting, and it was short but everything came together at the end...!
