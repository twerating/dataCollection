Honestly, Man from U.N.C.L.E was the most enjoyable spy movie this year. I would kill for a sequel.
The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is easily 1 of my favorite movies of 2015. Guy Ritchie effortlessly made a spy movie that's action-packed & funny
@60 minutes story about Spy Jack Barsky. So great make a movie about it, somebody please.
Is anyone else watching this former KGB spy's story!? Bananas, it needs to be a movie! #60minutes

@Mamabear0772 Well it's not your normal spy movie. That was fucking hilarious though. I didn't think they'd follow thru
Wow. The movie "Spy" was so bad that I turned my computer off mid way and deleted any trace of it ever being on it.

@ThatAquaWriter Then it shouldn't have the word "spies" in the title, Ander. Any spy movie needs to have 5 cars explode. Thats the rule.
Wow, Spectre was amazing! It was the first James Bond movie where he didn't need to do any spy activities! /s

Jus popped some champagne and the movie lineup is: south paw, San Andreas and spy.. Oh and I'm coming up on fan duel. Happy Changkuoth!
Whenever Silvester Stallone is in a movie, I remember Spy Kids more than Rocky ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Really loved the movie Spy. Watched a serious spy movie before it and it didn't even come close. The story was captivating and very funny.
Saw Bridge of Spies today. Very good movie. My favorite genre is cold war spy movies, so I was always gonna enjoy it.
Spy (movie) had some parts I didn't like, but honestly, the descriptions of the violence people planned to do were so ridiculous and funny.
Spy Kids 2 is my favorite sequel of all time. What is everyone's favorite movie sequel?
Old movie night: Gripping spy thriller/mystery 'Charade', my grandfather's fave. Slick Cary Grant & a romantically forward Audrey Hepburn.<3

Spy is Melissa McCarthy's best movie like Gilmore Girls is her best TV show.

I dozed off watching THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E, so I watched a GAME OF THRONES episode to wake me up & finish the film. Still a dull spy movie.

I'm watching a movie so old that a woman paid a man $1 to spy on someone, and he felt she may be overpaying him lol
The Man From U.N.C.L.E is such a weird movie. A British man is an American spy while an American is a Soviet spy.

@apbattman @DDoherty_ @theonetruecarl Man From UNCLE is the best spy movie of 2015 in my opinion. It's even in my top 5 of 2015
@LegolasQuinn And it's still the best spy movie of 2015 as well

Spectre is definitely among my favorite Bond movies. The right mixture of seriousness and old school good fun spy movie #DanielCraig
Just watched Spy! What a fantastic movie! Just brilliant
Spy is definitely a must-watch movie. Melissa McCarthy acting was so good.

Just saw Spy for the first time and LOVED IT but this was MAYBE a poor choice of day to see a movie featuring terrorists with bombs in Paris
If you want to see a parody of a really good spy movie, Austin Powers, then look no further and go watch Spectre.
Having an awful time watching Spy Kids 2. This movie is awful. And strangely very religious.
I thought that Spectre was better than Skyfall because it was actually a spy movie and didn't descend inexplicably into a Home Alone sequel.
We're watching Spy and the kitchen fight choreography is amazing. Super fun movie, too. Plus Peter Serafinowicz is great.

Dug THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E., a spy movie with actual spies in it.

*watching mortal combat* Hannah:"this looks like a spy kids movie"
@seasalttears "get in the weeds"- they all hide behind a bush and pop out cheesy spy movie style
@immiebroods @gambitpeggy182 spy kids 3 is by far the worst movie in the series 1 , 2 , and 4 are good
Perhaps Idris Elba should just star in a movie about a spy, for a government, who goes on missions, in fast cars and has cool gadgets
David Hoffman's Billion Dollar Spy will make a terrific espionage movie adaption if someone decided to use it

Really watching spy kids cause it's my favorite movie #judgeme
Spectre was a cool action flick but that's the problem, it should be a great bond flick but it wasn't. It was a generic spy movie :(
Is it too much to ask for a spy movie with Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, James Macavoy, Idris Elba, Hugh Jackman and Jason Statham
@Coolnerd19 I've never seen Spy Kids but can already tell you that it's nothing like it lol Such a fun movie
Everybody remember the movie Harriet The Spy? She grew up to be the girl who flashes her tits in Eurotrip.

@MuseZack I haven't seen SPECTRE yet, but I definitely think you could make a great spy movie with VC/startup guys as the villains.
I'd be more into going to Spectre if the last spy/action movie I went to I didn't have to listen to someone getting a sloppy bj behind me
Spy movie spoofs r usually better than actual spy movies. Actually lots of spoofs r better than the movies they spoof. Spoof is a great word
So Spectre was like...objectively bad in every way and I'm SO disappointed. Almost impossible for me to dislike a spy movie, but here we are

"There wasn't enough action in that spy movie." The entire point of being a spy is not to draw attention. @MovieJerks #jamesbondnotreal
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/AHHH770W4Wk?a  Spy Kids (1/10) Movie CLIP - Marriage is a Mission (2001) HD
The twins spent the last half hour spying on me and "caught" me...wait for it... folding laundry. Worst spy movie premise ever.
Angelina Jolie should make another "Salt". Loved that movie. Great spy thriller.
@randi4short Hahaha! You know that face-off machine is real, right (according to the movie Spy)?!
@super_trampp It's not really a typical spy movie - it's more about a spy (prisoner) swap that really happened during the Cold War.

Man this is ALL set around Vauxhall. It'll be another thing to add to my 'Dan is in a spy movie' fantasies while dawdling up to the train.
anyway, spy is an excellent movie and casual is an excellent show and both these things have fat women having agency of their sexuality YAY

I need a new Spy Kids movie in my life
@Kingfluffy Agreed. Man from UNCLE was fucking great. Better spy movie than Spectre by a wide margin.

@Kevin_Church it's not like doing a spy movie with James Bond in it and a bunch of action set prices is that hard a challenge.
@Saj51Khan @DangerEnPassant @john_cade think Craig closest to the novels & Casino Royale my fave movie. Spy Who Loved Me second.

Not sure what movie I should see... #Spectre007 or #ThePeanutsMovie. Picking from a family kids movie and a SPY ACTION MOVIE should be easy.
Watch spectre, and it is like every damn spy movie where in the end bond get the girl, and car

left my jacket in the movie theatre, did a super spy, super illegal u-turn to go back and get it #justjamesbondthingz
Spy movie. Jason Statham finally gets the chance to make fun of himself.
Kingsman, M:I 5, Man from UNCLE. By many accounts, Spectre was maybe the fourth-best spy movie of the year? Maybe fifth if you count "Spy?"
Loving this movie right now .. Wish I had some sketchy neighbors I could spy on
*PLANNING MEETING FOR SEQUEL TO SPY MOVIE* "What if, like, there's a bigger corporation behind the corporation from the last one?"
Spectre was okay, not as good as Skyfall. Bond films anymore feel like the need more premise than just "spy movie"

Specre, another James Bond movie with no new spy gadgets. Did the writers run out of ideas? Quite disappointing, really.
Quantico makes me wanna become a special agent But so does every other spy/secret agent movie or tv show I watch
Spy is lowkey a really funny movie
I liked Spectre alright. Motivations were lame and the love story shouldn't have been there. Other than that it was a suspenseful spy movie.
Ur lying if you say you never wanted a Ralph of your own after watching a Spy Kids movie
I want a Moneypenny movie omg. I bet she's actually a spy and she's been playing Bond. https://twitter.com/caraellison/status/663532975796199424 …
SPY is such an odd movie lmao
Kickstarter for twit crew to rent a theater and watch every shitty spy movie consecutively
Watching #Spy with my babe, @SeanMEp and Coraline. Enjoying the movie so far. @melissamccarthy and Rose Byrne are pretty funny!!
@Wecknerd I didn't mind it either, it was more of an old school spy movie than the action movies the past 3 were. Still had great action.
Holy shit @paulfeig’s Spy was outstanding. Haven’t laughed that much during a movie in a long time. Highly recommended. #faceoffmachine
Stop pretending otherwise: We all know SPY was the best espionage movie of the year.
@BrianCBaer Haha the other night I was watching a spy movie with my husband and I had to explain MI6.
Gonna say it. Casino Royale is boring. Poker is a boring scenario to build a spy movie and/or book around.
Also, can a modern spy movie please dispense with this "secret agents are a relic" theme? By my count, this is the 87th time it's used.
Okay, for a spoof movie, the theme song for SPY is insanely kickass. Gorgeous Bond-esque horns, kickass big-voiced female vocals.
