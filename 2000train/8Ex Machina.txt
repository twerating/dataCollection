We'd have to add Oscar Issac's dance scene in Ex Machina to @WayTooIndie's list of the best movie moments of 2015. http://ow.ly/VTPgD 
Ex-Machina is by far Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac's best science fiction movie of the year. There, I said it.
This scene is simply awesome: Ex Machina Movie CLIP - Tear Up The F@king Dance Floor (2015) https://youtu.be/o6HXmYi6Jw8  via @YouTube
Huh. I just watched the movie Ex Machina. I HAVE THOUGHTS.
Proyas is SO talented (The Crow, Dark City) but he needs to find a movie like EX MACHINA. Something small & cool, not big & bombastic.
34 movie scripts from 2015 including Carol, Ex Machina, Inside Out, Room, Steve Jobs, Straight Outta Compton http://ow.ly/Vq2qh 
No matter what Oscar Isaac does in Star Wars, he'll never top his best scene of the year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvYPCNCGEK8 …
Ex Machina was easily one of the best movies of the past year, and the dance scene is one of my favourite movie scenes ever
Just watched Ex Machina. Great movie! A couple parts I had to hide the screen for, since I am on a plane. But man, Oscar Isaac rocks.
Ex Machina: An absolutely fantastic movie that will creep you out more than you want/ever knew was possible. #ArtificialIntelligence #aaaaaa
Tonight’s movie is EX MACHINA.
I just watched ex_machina, pleasantly surprised. Damn good movie. Beautifully shot.
Knowing some of the movie's I'm getting for Christmas is a double edged sword...Ex Machina, Scott Pilgrim VS. The World, Gone Girl
@Pentadact also... the viral marketing for that movie was stellar http://bluebook.is/  && https://ava-sessions.com/ 
Our first episode is out! We cover this week's movie news and review Star Wars, Ex Machina, and Paul Blart 2 http://youtu.be/3WN9p5aKWjw 
sooooo it's almost the end of December (& even tho I haven't seen Krampus yet) can we all agree that Ex Machina was the best movie of 2015
I can't believe all of your snub articles are snubbing EX MACHINA. If that movie comes out in December it's in all the awards.

Ex Machina is an incredible movie, and I understand the ending was to show that she wasn't self aware, but it made me cry. Sociopathic AI.

On second viewing tonight, Ex Machina remains possibly my favourite movie of the year. A masterclass in lean, precise storytelling.
Watched Ex Machina for the 2nd time tonight. My memory was right: this movie is _perfect_. Haven't seen a film this good in years.
@AudhamEnTha Just watched Ex Machina. This is totally your kind of movie.
Holy shit Ex Machina is amazing. I'm in love with this movie already
@kelseyr713 Ex Machina, where he actually plays a total creep. But it's a fantastic movie.
Finally saw Ex-Machina. What a phenomenal movie! I mean, it introduces great ideas, explores them and is just eagerly fascinating!

Just finished watching Ex Machina, which I rented for 10 cents from the Windows Store. The movie was so good I'm buying it on Blu-ray.
Just watched Ex Machina. Great movie. Just remind me to not be the first guy to create A.I. That's a lot of responsibility for one guy.

So Ex Machina is a movie where two dudes argue over whether women exist or not?
besides inception, ex machina is also a pretty trippy movie, so is a beautiful mind
Finally watching Ex Machina. This movie is fascinating. It's free on Amazon prime by the way.
If you haven't seen "ex machina" you're really doing yourself a disservice. I love this movie and have seen it three times

Ex Machina is an awesome movie. Honestly impressed humans made it as far as we have, if it's the AI that gets us thats an achievement IMO.
The best scene in Ex Machina is undoubtedly the scene where the movie cuts for a disco dance scene out of fucking nowhere.

A couple of weeks ago, I watched this movie called "Ex Machina" that has this guy (Nathan) who creates and develops AI humanoids...
For those of you who have Sky Movies, Ex Machina is on Premiere. Get on it. Fantastic movie. #film
"Ex Machina" was the BEST movie I've seen in a long while! Go see it now!
After watching The Spongebob Movie again: who cares if the ending is a deus ex machina? It's the best damn deus ex machina ever!

Burnt is not a good movie to see while hungry. Also, Alicia Vikander plays, ironically, a deus ex machina.
Just caught ex machina (movie) pretty good story hopefully not prophetic
I think Ava in the movie "Ex Machina" got a raw deal. I mean, who didn't secretly cheer when she pulled Nathan's head off? | #ExMachina

Ex Machina has been the best movie I've seen on artificial intelligence thus far. #HBRogue AI by Spielberg was disappointing.

In Ex-Machina, it must be noted that her shoes at the end of movie showed AI can learn better taste in shoes than most high-street shoppers
Watched Ex Machina last night - fantastic movie, one of my favourites of the year for sure!

Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac are my new favorite movie duo (see: Ex Machina and new Star Wars)

I'm having difficulty getting over how good of a movie Unfriended was. I think it's #2 for my favorite movie of the year, under Ex Machina.

@jimalkhalili imo: Interstellar > Martian = Ex Machina. Gravity is just a big budget disaster movie like Armageddon, not sci-fi.
Q is, will The Martian replace ex Machina as best scifi movie I've seen in recent years? (OK, I did enjoy Gravity and Interstellar too.)
Ex Machina is an amazing movie. Fascinating study of what it means to be human. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend it very highly.
just watched ex machina, that was a mistake, really weird movie, but it was a really cool concept
Horror movies dont scare me, but for a movie thats not even considered a horror movie, Ex Machina is the scariest I've seen in a long time.

EX MACHINA still holds up as one of my favorite films so far this year. The creepy, smart sci-fi movie that the whole damn family can enjoy.
I have to pick between The Martian, Fury Road, and Ex Machina for my favorite sci-fi movie of 2015. Best impossible decision ever.

After I finished watching Ex Machina, I had a mini existential crisis for about ten minutes. Good movie. Review coming.
@screenings Kids will like it, adequate for adults. Cheesy dialogue and some deus ex machina at parts, but that's what a PG movie brings.

Thank you @CollinPotato for the movie recommendation of Ex Machina. Incredible movie. Wow. Just wow. I recommend it highly.
@PoetAtArms this is my commentary on Ex Machina, the movie about sexy murder robots. #spoilers
Ex Machina is a pretty strange movie
Watched Ex Machina tonight: Cool movie. Important: if you're a gazillionare with a compound invest in security beyond key cards.
just finished 'ex machina' & wow what a semi mind-phuck, sad but also liberating-based movie.
Ex Machina lived up to my expectation. Nothing beats a good scifi movie. #ExMachina
Ex Machina was really good. Very interesting & it keeps you on your toes. My 2nd fav movie of the year so far
Finally saw Ex Machina. Fantastic movie. The best I've seen in a long time. Edge of my seat the whole time with hardly any action.
Just watched "ex-machina" on http://www.zmovie.tw  Slow paced movie but awesome ending! #ArtificialIintelligence

Ex Machina is what every movie made from now on should be. Socially conscious sci fi thriller. Starring Oscar Isaac. Last part imperative
I highly recommend seeing the movie Ex Machina.
Ex Machina, trippy movie but not immune to plot holes.
Watched Ex Machina again; it's such a beautiful movie. One of my favorites this year. Oscar Isaac & Alicia Vikander deserves award attention
There is nothing better than having your mind blown by a movie. Ex Machina just DESTROYED me wow wow wow
Watching Ex Machina. I've never watched a movie in which Oscar Isaac wasn't effortlessly intimidating.
I finally watched Ex Machina, 20 mins before the ending I had to leave. Now I feel like I need to restart the movie to get me where I was.
Ex Machina is more trippy than a Christopher Nolan movie
ex machina may be the craziest movie that I have ever seen
I don't think Ex Machina is the best movie of the year. But its definitely top 3

If I can recommend you watch one thing before the years end make it "Ex Machina"...Seriously unbelievable movie..you won't regret it
...so instead the solution is to add an extra "all-knowing" Deus Ex Machina character who shows up in Act III to stop the movie cold...
