So many cool hairstyle in the maze runner movie. They always runnin but their hairstyle dgaf about the air hahaha
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/kWSt3TFvYzc?a  The Maze Runner - Movie Review
↬ the maze runner ↬ {late} day 4: favourite movie ↬ #vgdec (Vine by lahey woah) https://vine.co/v/i7KTbreUV6w 
I don't know which movie is my fav ! Both are so great ! https://vine.co/v/eb6ui5aBQPD 
Also, the MAZE RUNNER: SCORCH TRIALS movie came out on DVD/Blu-ray today! Cannot wait to watch that one again
Call me lame but i just started reading the first book of the maze runner series and boy, how disappointed i am in the movie when i read it
The maze runner movie is nothing like the book and I'm kinda salty
Movie series's like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, and Divergent are my favorites man.
the maze runner movie: saddest ending ever the scorch trials movie: the ending doesn't exist the death cure movie: the movie doesn't exist
Don't let finals bring ya down. Tonight's free movie is The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials. Tonight @ 4pm and 7pm in the CUB Aud.
Divergent is the best movie and book, The maze runner is slightly okay. The hunger games is just boring, but let me not comment.
The bat is gone & movies are back on tonight! The Maze Runner will be playing at 7p and The Visit at 9:30p! Take a break, see a movie!
the maze runner is such a good movie
im watching the maze runner movie i cant wait to be disappointed by how different it is from the book
The Maze Runner is the most intense movie of 2015
Like the maze runner movie was close enough but there was only one thing in the scorch that was the same and that was one ding dang quote
I wish the maze runner was a series instead of a movie
I don't really remember how the maze runner book went but I'm almost positive it went nothing how the movie portrayed it

The Maze Runner, movie alone, is definitely amazing. But I've read the book. So it's kinda disappointing.

The Maze Runner & the 2nd part of the movie is goooood !!

The maze runner 2 is a good movie

@twt_buku the maze runner is amazeballs although that the changes they made in the movie is cringe worthy its too much HAHHA
the maze runner book is totally different from the movie
The Maze Runner -Scorch Trial is a shit movie. Just downloaded and watched the 1080p ver
somebody: whats the third movie of the maze runner? me: the death cure but according to the movies its "Finding Minho"
WOWZERZS I gotta admit, The Maze Runner sequel, The Scorch Trials MOVIE, is BETTER than the book. SO. MUCH. BETTER.

I've been pulled back to the hunger games fandom cause of the movie yesterday. The maze runner is still my fav.
just realized that the maze runner novels is completely different from the movie....i read the wikipedia article. now im really confused
Because I watched THE MAZE RUNNER, Netflix recommends that I watch THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE: SPONGE OUT OF WATER???
The movie The Maze Runner was amazing but the book was better. So what does that say about the book
The Maze Runner is my new favorite movie. Disregarding the book.

Movie watching is so relaxing but I wish it had been the maze runner
@GoingForGoldYT Definitely not, or there is a danger of hating the movie if it misses key elements from the book. See: The Maze Runner.
*Watching a book based movie with my family e.g divergent or the maze runner* me: no no no that's not what happened in the book!
The maze runner scorch trials was such a good fucking movie can't wait till the 3rd one comes out

@IanZGomes The Maze Runner, it's different than the movie. It's good.
The Maze Runner is my new favorite movie series. No doubt!
now lemme see how the maze runner scorch trials movie is different from the book...
The Maze Runner: Scorch Trial Didn't like the way the movie ended, I wanted more
Os: the maze runner (the book is still better than the movie and it hurts a lot)
I've read The Maze Runner trilogy & am now watching the movie, and the story still doesn't make sense.

Things I'd Be Okay With: franchises splitting every movie in 1/2 to fit allll the details i.e. the maze runner, the hunger games, divergent
@dmsfxryou they tried to make it too much of an action movie and the maze runner isn't the hunger games so they should't try to make it that

Stuck trying to decide between watching a movie or reading The Maze Runner...
I told my friend that I run a fan account and she goes "what do you do on there? Post stuff like "The Maze Runner is the best movie ever"?
After sitting there for 5 minutes I decided to ask the young gentleman behind us, "this is the maze runner movie, right?" & he says no..

//Might read the Maze Runner (at least first book). No plans to see the movie. Bandwagoning, but I may end up RPing one of the characters.
I think I'll read The Maze Runner first before watching any of its movie adaptations.
I don't think I've ever seen a movie as intense as The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. Seriously seriously amazing. @dylanobrien
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/p2TLuC-trus?a  Ellie Goulding - Beating Heart (from the movie 'The Maze Runner')
Even though I didn't see the first movie The Maze Runner was pretty cool
If you liked the movie The Maze Runner you have to watch the second one! It's a must
I didn't think The Maze Runner was a good movie at first, but it suprisingly is.
bless Wes Ball for directing such an epic adventure that is the maze runner movie series
Just finished the Maze Runner movie. It was pretty good. #RIPChuck
The Maze Runner was a good ass movie.

The Maze Runner was an excellent movie! I really loved it.

I've watched the movie ( The Maze Runner 2 ) without watching 1, so maybe that's why I didn't understand any shit
The maze runner is such a good movie
Thursday went and saw the maze runner:scorch trials absolutely luved it I thought it was better than the first movie!
Movie treat:The maze runner 2. I've been reluctant to watch this film, but giving in today cos pawn sacrifice & the Martian is still nextwk.
tbh ive never read the maze runner series the only reason I'm going to see the new movie is cuz Dylan O'Brian
Guys part 2 of the maze runner is a really good movie
The Maze Runner was just awesome. The second installment of the movie, Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials is a bit boring compared to that.
the maze runner was actually a pretty good movie
So The Maze Runner Scorch Trails is good as hell....might be the best movie ice seen all year
But the Maze Runner Scorch Trials had me thinking it was an action movie so I was scared to death when I saw that zombie looking thing!
Why do they always kill the kid in a action movie? Hunger games, the maze runner... My god
Sorry, movie-series-based-on-YA-dystopian-book-series fans, but the Maze Runner movie is very dumb and bad.
Just saw "The Maze Runner: Scorch Trails" & damn it's a good movie! More thrilling & entertaining then the last. & Dylan O'Brien though...
The Maze Runner was a good movie
Brandon and I went to go see the maze runner but I payed more attention to him than to the movie
The Maze Runner movie is 1000x better than the book!! (Which I couldn't even get through)
The maze runner movie date sounds so perfect

The maze runner series is so well done that even my dad likes it, and he's a very picky movie critic
Watching scorch trials like, is The Walking Dead: the Movie or the sequeal to the maze runner?
I saw about 50-odd minutes of the Maze Runner Scorch Trials movie and it was completely insane and incoherent.
The Maze Runner is the best movie it made me cry the best movie I ever seen

I'm convinced that the only way to enjoy the Maze Runner movies is to read the books AFTER you see the movie.

If you have epilepsy don't watch the maze runner But the movie was totally awesome
Didn't expect that type of movie from the Maze Runner series. I think I'd rank it the best out of all the books series so far
Got this super sweet "wckd" pin for the movie version of the Maze Runner Series. #ScorchTrials pic.twitter.com/xtydeMs80X
Haven't read any of the Maze Runner books, and I'm no movie critic, but I enjoyed Scorch Trials! I'd say it was worth. :3
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/53PH5qxzvfY?a  The Maze Runner Movie B-ROLL 1 (2014) - Dylan O'Brien Movie HD
When Shawndina didn't even know there was a first movie the maze runner
Thank god the theaters power went out during the maze runner because that movie was trash
The maze runner and the scorch trials don't even look like they should be part of the same movie series
PSA: The Maze Runner 2 trailer does not show zombies in it, BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY TERRIFYING ZOMBIES IN THE MOVIE
Just so everyone knows, the maze runner scorpion trials movie is bomb so go see it

If anyone's gonna go see the Maze Runner Scorch Trials movie be prepared it's actually kinda scary
Dear movie theaters, its #TheScorchTrials not The Maze Runner 2. Just to clear things here
Wasn't sure whether I would enjoy The Maze Runner movie, but apparently now I want to read the full series.
I thought The Maze Runner movie was far from the book, but wow The Scorch Trials was off entirely.
The maze runner movie was pretty damn awesome

me: grills little brother about why he likes the maze runner bc it's not a superhero/iconic movie him: because it's an interesting concept
After so much similarity between the Maze Runner book and movie, I am just so confused. And disappointed.
Can't handle the anticipation for the third movie , I'm gonna read the Maze Runner series
I am honestly mad i wasted my time with that movie. If you read the Maze Runner books don't watch #ScorchTrials
I just- what was the maze runner and why are there zombies and I just- every movie is the same- the world ends and teens rule?

Watching the Maze Runner movie now and idk if I like how they're skipping/working through the beginning of the book lol.
the maze in the maze runner movie is like finding a way out the friendzone.
So The Maze Runner is the most ethnically diverse teen movie ever
Great they turned the Maze runner into a shitty zombie movie. #ScorchTrials
