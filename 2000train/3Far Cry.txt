What are REAL 80's movie's like Kung Fury, Far Cry Blood Dragon Etc.? via /r/movies http://ift.tt/1d3NnOW 
FAR CRY 3: BLOOD DRAGON = THE MANLIEST MAN GAME EVER KUNG FURRY= THE MANLIEST MAN MOVIE EVER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg …
If you loved Far Cry:Blood Dragon you'll love Kung Fury: Free Movie + Steam Game http://store.steampowered.com/app/374570/  Music Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTidn2dBYbY …
O.M.G. I am VERY happy w/this! It's like Far Cry: Blood Dragon liquified and injected! KUNG FURY Ofc. Movie https://youtu.be/bS5P_LAqiVg 
Kung Fury is essentially the movie version of video game "Far Cry Blood Dragon" https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0dofacvjRkc …
@proteus4994 It's like if Far Cry Blood Dragon was made into a movie 10x better.
So Kung Fury is like if they made Far Cry Blood Dragon into a movie?
Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon did Kung Fury better than Kung Fury. Black Dynamite (movie) and Danger 5 both did their own period pastiches better.
Kung Fury is basically Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon: The Movie (and that is a very very very good thing)
This is the greatest 80's action movie of 2015. I want to play Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon again. #KungFury https://youtu.be/bS5P_LAqiVg 
Percy Jackson book is far cry better than the movie *sighs*
Far Cry: Blood Dragon is worth a buy if tou haven't played it, if you love 80's movie references, 16 bit cutscenes, and neon.

FAR CRY AND WATCH DOGS IS GETTING A MOVIE? YOOOO
The music in the bathroom rolled over to Far Cry: Blood Dragon. Now I have some serious 80's action movie nostalgia. I also wanna play FC:BG
I've got the house to myself, so I made tonight a movie/game night. Watched Guardians of the Galaxy and now I'm gonna play some Far Cry 4.
@YZYMANDIAS If they ever made a Far Cry 4 movie they should cast "I am de captain now" guy as Longinus. Agree/disagree?
gotta love how far cry went from extremely hard b-movie schlock to easy "social commentary"
it was the Far Cry 2 of movie scenes
Avengers 2 wasn't bad, but a far cry from the first movie. Just too much going on. Shouldve been 1 hour longer or 2 storylines shorter.

Far Cry 4 is amazing. Also, I really want to watch a crappy movie called Krull, but it's not on Netflix. Classified 1st world.

“Far Cry Blood dragon is like watching an 80s action movie today. FC3 and 4 are like watching an 80s action movie in the 80s.”
Forcing myself to watch Dumb and Dumber To. I want to see this movie. I really do! I just really struggle to shut off Far Cry 4.
So... It's pretty much the movie Speed but Far Cry style!!! #PS4share http://youtu.be/RAgqycBx2rs 
If they ever made a Far Cry movie, Hurk would be played by Bill Paxton
Pagan Min is a villain meant for a James Bond movie not Far Cry.

Far Cry 4 ends with music that mimics a Tarantino movie, but it has none of the zest or weird energy it is alluding to. It's just nasty.

Transformers 4 was chaotic and overlong. It wasn't the worst movie ever. It's better than 2 and maybe 3, but a far cry from Transformers 1.

Far Cry now showing in Qatar. Starring: Til Schweiger, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Natalia, Udo Kier. Check movie timings on http://www.CinemaQatar.com/ 
Far Cry 4 is set in India, and the main villain is a British viceroy-type. It's like a twisted Bollywood movie.

Far Cry Blood Dragon is so fun. Super 80's and so many 80's movie references hahaha

@SpaceKappa Blood Dragon is not like any of the other Far Cry games, it is literally every 80s action movie stuffed into a video game

The seriousness of The Division’s American tragedy is a weird contrast to Far Cry 4’s goofy action-movie antics in the Himalayas.

Watching the Far Cry movie. Hard to find the words to describe.
Die Antwoord fits Far Cry 3 perfectly. The gameplay is rather dull after you have crafted everything, and the plot is like a B-Movie...

Far Cry is getting a movie? I though Uwe Boll made a Far Cry movie. On second thought, forget I tweet that.
Far Cry 3 is less like a Rambo action movie and more like a psychological thriller. Pretty intense stuff.

The movie Driven first introduced me to Til Schweiger, who starred in Inglourious Basterds and the movie Far Cry, based on the video game.
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon is a great FPS 80's throwback with everything you would expect from an 80's action movie; definitely worth the price.

Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon - A great '80s action movie love letter. Not quite as clever, funny as hoped. Still a lot of fun.
Nathan checks out just a few of the action movie references in Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Have you spotted any others? http://ow.ly/kFsKc 
Far cry 3: blood dragon seems to be pretty fun. I really dig the music and the cheesy action movie style.
Far Cry Blood Dragon is like a cyberpunk videogame of the movie Commando : it's both awesome and laughable ^^
Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon intentionally hits the bad/good 80's Sci-Fi movie sweet spot. But it's a game you can play. So. Much. Fun.
Well, Blood Dragon's credits are as long as the original Far Cry 3's. I guess I'll go see a movie while I wait.
That Far Cry Blood Dragon thing is like a bad rendition of an 80s futuristic action movie, neon colors included.
Any one else been enjoying Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon? Absolutely loving it.. More 80's movie gags than you could shake a chunky VHS tape at!
There should be a movie based on far cry 3 storyline
I hope there will be a "Movie Version" of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon from @dansg08 , the Bioshock Infinite was great http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iZZg2qiBos&feature=share&list=SP9wpzJw8GKy6CRgdOXawu9pJiBzzEhM-n …
@FarCrygame Gameplay certainly lives up to it's own premise. This 80's action movie twist on the Far Cry 3 mechanics has killer aesthetics!

@SmoshGames Definitely far cry 3. That would be so cool to watch vaas or someone in a movie
@SmoshGames movie based on Vaas from far cry 3 or uncharted
@SmoshGames Far cry 3. I think Vaas would be a really interesting character to watch. Kinda like the joker. It could be a cool movie

Far cry 3 and a movie after work.
I'm a glutton for punishment. Far Cry the Movie http://twitpic.com/bw1b63 
I work at a movie theater as a projectionist, this is what I did tonight in my spare time. Tomorrow will be Far Cry 3 http://adf.ly/HRvqP 
Watchin the old school "Miracle on Ice" movie from 1981...far cry from "Miracle", but still pretty cool.
FAR CRY JUST MADE A KILL BILL REFERENCE IM LITERALLY DYING WHAT IS LIFE THAT'S MY FAVORITE MOVIE UGH DONE.
If Far Cry 3 were a movie Vaas is the male equivalent to Leonardo DiCaprio, I'd cry every time he dies.
A Far Cry movie! Hmmm checking it out as I tweet!
@n0nhhh My girlfriend and I talk video games all the time! Our favorite date is me playing Far Cry 3 for her like its a movie :)
If you dug @MandoMichael in Far Cry 3, and I suspect you did, check out his gritty perf in the 2010 movie Territories. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1683970/ …
the plot of Far Cry 3 could make a sick movie, as long as it had a Breaking Bad-type character arc for the protagonist
If they insist on making movies after video games, why not make a Far Cry movie? I would love to see Michael Mando play Vaas in a movie! :D
Far Cry 3 Review: "I want to play a game, not watch a movie" (WIRED) http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2013/01/far-cry-3-review/ …
I still cannae figure out if Far Cry 3's intro movie was intended to make you hate the characters or think they were "rad".
@Simplemachines_ I mean far cry 2 is gritty and places you in the middle of an African civil war.Far cry 3 is a Channing Tatum movie
I favorited a @YouTube video from @ghostrobo http://youtu.be/gj3hXW71fNE?a  Far Cry 3 THE MOVIE - Gameplay Walkthrough Part 32 - Xbox
@DaneSager Also, and I'm not proud of this, I enjoyed Far Cry as a "Had a few drinks and I've got a pizza on hand" kind of movie.
Just got Far Cry 3. Definitely one of the best games of 2012
Well watching a movie went out of the window I should realise a quick game of Far Cry 3 always turns into several hours!
Loving the old nollywood movie I'm watching. Far cry from the crappy scripts of modern nollywood.
Two minutes into the intro movie and I'm already sold on Far Cry 3, and I don't even like shooters all that much. That's good writing.
@RaygunBrown What we really need is a Far Cry or Assassin's Creed movie. That would be the shiznizzle!
@TheRazoredEdge There is also a Far Cry movie...
Apparently there is a movie for Far Cry.
@YOTESLAYA good movie to watch if you haven't is lockout. And its alright but far cry also. Movie adaptation of far cry the game.
