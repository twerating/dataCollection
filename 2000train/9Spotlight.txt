I hope cable TV is still around in 10 years because the movie Spotlight should be a 'watch it on TNT at 4pm on a Saturday' classic.
For the last time Spotlight is a great movie. It's on my top ten. It's probably going to win best picture. 1/2

Spotlight is an amazing movie. It may sound like a movie you don't wanna watch but, trust me, you must watch it.
I'd love to see a movie where characters from SPOTLIGHT, THE FIGHTER, THE TOWN, & THE DEPARTED all interacted with each other at a Sox game.

"Spotlight" is easily the best newspaper movie since "All the President's Men." Like that film, it's told as a thriller. @SpotlightMovie
Just saw movie "Spotlight" about the Catholic priest abuse cover-up. How can anyone belong to that corrupt & morally bankrupt organisation?
Great. The one movie I was actually wanting to see at @dubaifilm (i.e. #Spotlight) shows on a day I'm not in the country. #yuhatemeuniverse
"Spotlight" was great. Maybe the equal of "All the Presidents Men," which I never thought I'd say, and a brilliant Boston movie. Go see.

Loved SPOTLIGHT! Very wisely let the story be told rather than making the movie itself the story as many other directors might do.
Most of the movie reviewers I follow are saying that Spotlight is absolutely brilliant. Have to watch ASAP
@rron007 @IamFlaurentSoki has he even made a good movie before Spotlight?

spotlight is a REALLY good movie. i also feel like there's no hope in the world and people are horrible. So…ya know…see it, i guess….?
So far SPOTLIGHT has the best Boston accents of any recent movie. Because the actors aren't trying to do Boston accents.
The best movie in theatres right now is spotlight, go see it if you get a chance

It's still early but Spotlight is my favourite movie of the year so far. Gonna be tough to beat. I want to chuck an Oscar at Mark Ruffalo.

@scott_tobias I realize I'm being glib calling SPOTLIGHT "artless." It's an excellent movie. Just a bit meat-and-potatoes compared to ATPM.
"Spotlight" is a great movie. Crazy good cast (McAdams, Ruffalo, Schreiber, Slattery, Cudup, Tucci) and Michael Keaton is especially strong.
@theHobbyStudios @kristapley SPOTLIGHT is a lovely movie. I have no issues with any of the awards we gave today. Gooooooood year.

Spotlight is such a good movie. Even though I should have had Rachel Whosie-Dingys-part. I would've done the accent.

"Spotlight" was pretty much the scariest movie I've seen all year and very well done. Enjoy the unsolicited film review, internet universe.

Saw Creed tonight. Great movie. Next up Spotlight & Star Wars. Movie watching can be addictive this time of year!
Whoever sees this, you must watch Spotlight. Great movie with a great story. Definitely a must see.

About to see my 45th different movie in theaters, this year! Saw my 44th, a few hours ago. #Krampus #Spotlight
Spotlight was an outstanding movie. Gotta go see it
Spotlight isn't bad but the thought of it winning Best Picture is sad because it's so flagrantly uncinematic. Why IS it a movie?
Doing my favorite thing on Saturday... at the movies! :] — watching Spotlight Movie at Cinemaworld http://fb.me/71wRrl8gz 
Between The Cobbler and Spotlight, Tom McCarthy has a shot of making the best and worst movie of the year. But which is which?
SPOTLIGHT is a terrific movie, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the correct Best Picture choice. Good job, Boston.
Going to see movie" #Spotlight" today--just another case of longstanding atrocities by " #religious" monsters.

If you really like being Catholic then don't see #Spotlight. I'm not so I enjoyed the movie but I left the theater physically angry
Spotlight: the kind of movie that seldom gets made anymore, about a kind of journalism that is seldom done anymore. #SpotlightMovie
@MupptLuv I've heard from many practicing Catholics who believe the Spotlight Team stories and the movie will make the Church stronger.
Spotlight.......such a good movie:::::::: my stomach is still upset and my faith in the Catholic Church has vanished but amazing movie.

But also, Spotlight is pretty much everything they're saying: great movie about the power of digging down into a story that needed telling.

"Spotlight" is a good movie.
Spotlight best movie about Boston & journalism in years. Only problem: it shows a Starbucks & no Dunkin Donuts. Unheard of in 2001 Boston
Man, was hoping the #stlcards would sign someone while I was in Spotlight (pretty good movie).
Saw Spotlight tonight & wanted to know if it's possible to make a Boston movie without a scene at Fenway?

Now is the time to see SPOTLIGHT, a rare Boston movie where everyone isn't shooting each other. (At least, I don't think they are.)
alright i'm just gonna say it: red vines get too much of the movie snack spotlight

Best movie of November: Spotlight or Creed. Worst movie of November: Love the Coopers, which almost makes me hate Christmas
SPOTLIGHT becomes only the third film this year to receive the coveted Nick Ostler Brilliant Movie Award (TM).
Mad Max: Fury Road is best movie of 2015? I highly admire it, but not sure it's best film. That honor goes to SICARIO or SPOTLIGHT.
Spotlight is a wonderful movie about a terrible crime in the Catholic Church. Very well done and keeps your interest. Bravo
has anybody seen a better movie than spotlight this year? cuz I think that might be the best one I've seen so far
MOVIE REVIEW: Spotlight. Exceptional, powerful, moving, important. We live in a dirty world. Go see this movie ASAP. 5 out of 5.

Another movie review. 'Spotlight' is excellent. Uniformly strong performances and engrossing in the 'All the Presidents Men' tradition.
Just saw Spotlight with @lyndee_owen. Great movie about an incredible cover-up.
Ummmm @SpotlightMovie JESUS! HOLY MARY MOTHER OF MOVIES! Probably the best movie of the Year! @BostonGlobe Spotlight team! Bravo!

I've seen "Spotlight" twice now, and both times I've seen people get emotional at the end. It's a great movie, but not showing everywhere.
Poignant film for a Massachusetts ex-Catholic like me. — watching Spotlight Movie
Spotlight was the most brilliant journalism movie I've seen in a very long time.
In the span of 2 hours the movie Spotlight managed to simultaneously break my heart & make me want to give a standing ovation.

Great review of an equally great movie: "In ‘Spotlight,’ Boston Globe Digs Up the Catholic Church’s Dirt" http://nyti.ms/1RxZQcr 
I loved Spotlight but my biggest takeaway from the movie is how surprisingly nostalgic I am for turn of the century wide-leg pants.
In other news, #Spotlight such a great movie about journalism that it made me less grumpy about pulling night cops duty on holiday weekend.
Just saw Spotlight. Excellent movie but my blood pressure is skyrocketing and I feel like I’ve been run over by a small fleet of trucks.

The #Spotlight movie just proved that investigative journalism is still so relevant. It's something I hunger for. Thanks @BostonGlobe
@grogg Spotlight is up there for best movie I've seen this year. You liked Trumbo? I was on the fence about seeing it
In the tradition of "All the President's Men," "Spotlight" is a non-nonsense newspaper movie. Let's hope it's not the last.
Something's been bugging me about SPOTLIGHT. About two thirds of the way through the movie, Ben Bradlee Jr tells Robinson:
Saw the movie "Spotlight" last night. Anyone who thinks newspapers and the work they do is not important should see this movie.

I saw Spotlight today. Wow, great movie, well done, and of course, so disturbing/unsettling. #SpotlightMovie
#Spotlight movie: 3/5 stars. More about the thrill of chasing a hot story than dealing with the subject matter. Miss opportunity IMO. #movie
Spotlight is a much better movie about Journalism (its power, purpose & practice) than All the President's Men.

#Spotlight took a lot out of me. I was so into the movie I was upset it finished & now I feel some type of way ️
SPOTLIGHT is the best date movie ever
Also everyone needs to watch Spotlight, amazing movie on a subject matter that hasn't gotten enough attention in my opinion
Every J-student who attends @mojonews should be required to see Spotlight! Great movie about even better reporters.

you should seriously go see Spotlight Movie. Seriously.
Spotlight: 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. A superb movie, with a sickening story that needed to be told
Just saw Spotlight. Very powerful movie shining light on the systemic pattern of child molestation by Catholic Church priests. Horrifying
I don't know what I can say about "Spotlight" that hasn't been already. Incredible movie, and an important story that needed to be told.
So yeah "Spotlight" was a ridiculously good movie
Spotlight is a very very well made movie. A depressing subject, that needed to be told. 4.6/5
@DeionGottaSTFU legend, sicario, spotlight, new movie with Bryan Cranston, concussion def will be
A lot more payoff in SPOTLIGHT. An easier movie, an easier case? Glad they both revel in the bullshit the job requires.
SPOTLIGHT (McCarthy 2015) - A truly great movie: both a riveting journalism procedural, and a melancholic requiem for a vanishing era.
Just saw the movie #spotlight and it is proof that not even Jesus can defeat The combined efforts of Howard Stark, the Hulk & Batman.
My review of SPOTLIGHT: The last word of the movie was also the title of the movie. 4/4 stars
If you see one movie this weekend, make it Spotlight.
@harryh523 @getmetheIV Wait so you're complaining that we liked a movie you haven't seen? I loved SPOTLIGHT, too, btw.
"Spotlight" was a really, really good movie. Highly recommend.
Spotlight was such a sad, moving, and important movie. I can't recommend a movie more than this one.

Really enjoyed Spotlight. Made me miss being a journalist. Very harsh on the Catholic Church but overall a highly entertaining movie.
Highly recommend the movie “Spotlight”, it’s like a less stylized Michael Mann film.
I just saw Spotlight. It was a very good movie.
One of the many virtues of SPOTLIGHT is that it is probably the most broadly recommendable movie of the year.
Wow, the movie "Spotlight" was fantastic. Best screenplay I've seen this year, too. Makes me reminisce about seeing The Insider back in '99

Spotlight is a fantastic movie. A reminder of why I wanted to get into journalism. Also, of why I don't practice Catholicism anymore.
If you are interested in journalism, Spotlight is the best movie I've seen on the subject (also best movie I've seen this year).

Seeing Spotlight. They misplaced the movie in the smallest theater and it's packed. Good job Regal.
If there was an Oscar for uncredited voice on the phone in a movie, Richard Jenkins would win hands down for Spotlight.

Thankful for @MarkRuffalo and his performance in Spotlight. Amazing job! This movie is a game changer... Definitely a must-see.
Spotlight was thought provoking, gripping, and most of all, important. If you see any movie soon, let it be that one.
The upside of 2pm “dinner” is that it leaves plenty of time after to see a movie (Spotlight) and still get home before the football is over.
UPDATE: The movie was amazing. I would highly recommend Spotlight.
Every journalist and Catholic needs to see the movie #Spotlight. Incredible. Few movies use the medium as effectively.

Watched SPOTLIGHT. If I can borrow a phrase from a @richardroeper review, I'd like to say, you will be drained by this movie.
Turn off the cable news & watch some real, gritty journalism in the movie "Spotlight." That's true reporting & work we do for YOU! #Paper
PLEASE. If you haven't seen the movie Spotlight, do it. It demonstrates the reason why Journalism is so important and always will be.
Would encourage all to go see the movie Spotlight. Right alongside All the President's Men and Almost Famous in journalism movie greats

Spotlight—great movie about investigative journalism, reminded me of watching All The President's Men in HS and wanting to be a journalist.

Spotlight was outstanding, The Martian was great, but the movie I can't stop thinking about is #Sicario -- Blew me away!

If you are staying away from Spotlight because it looks like bland Oscar bait, you need to reconsider. It's a great movie.

Harlem knights is classic. I wonder if today's comedians in the spotlight did a movie like that, would it be dope as the original?

The movie "Spotlight" is fantastic. Any film that can make investigative journalism look that thrilling gets two thumbs up. Well done.
@MikeEvafal @Glenn__Kenny Spotlight’s likely to be the movie with the biggest disappointment on Oscar nom morning or the big “shock” success
Spotlight gets Danial Ahmed's approval! Sick movie based on a true story.
Just saw "Spotlight." Brilliant. Best newspapering movie since "All the President's Men" & among best ever. I know the genre!
I went and saw Spotlight this weekend. It was really good. I found myself completely entrenched in the movie.
