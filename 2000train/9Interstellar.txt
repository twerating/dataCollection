interstellar is the greatest movie
The Interstellar soundtrack (and movie) is perfection

Idc what anyone says, the interstellar movie soundtrack is the most astonishing movie soundtrack in the whole world.
Just finished watching Interstellar, what an amazing movie!

Interstellar Sick Movie
Interstellar is the most mind fucking movie I have ever watched
The Martian is an *amazing* movie. Much much better than Interstellar for my taste…
@halle_mariee A year ago, today, we cried in a movie theater together while we watched Interstellar for the first time.
anyone that's seen interstellar and is good at physics/astronomy, can you please answer my questions about the movie
Interstellar is probably the greatest movie
I agree. Interstellar is the weakest Christopher Nolan movie.
Interstellar is among the very few science fiction movies which manage to touch your heart. That movie moves me man! I never miss it!
Interstellar is an awesome movie
Watching #Interstellar the movie for the 1st time... Wine will be started in a bit to accompany it ;)

Interstellar is going to be my favorite movie forever. It's going to take something next level to change that.
I'm supposed to watch interstellar for a movie project but fuccck it's hard to focus

@MostTrill_Plati @Jayzillaa the album had a very interstellar feel to it. (That movie made me cry btw.)
Interstellar makes me cry at least 3 times during the whole movie
@skambla Btw there is a book by the exec producer for @Interstellar who is a theoretical physicist, explaining the movie. LOL
Looking like it'll be another movie night. Watched two last night. Interstellar was phenomenal. Frequencies 4 (out of 5) stars.
Interstellar was also the first movie for a long time where I wondered whether the composer had watched the same scene I was watching.
@eveuhxx Nah, the only movie I cried during was interstellar when Matthew McConaughey saw the video of his daughter and started crying
Interstellar is just a phenomenal movie all around

Finally got around to watching Interstellar, fantastic movie. Interesting ideas too.
Still not over the movie Mad Max It's one of the best movies I have seen this year. Just like Interstellar I give it a 10.

Our Halloween scary movie night is Chase, Stefan, and I watching Interstellar again
that Interstellar movie is a 10/10. mind blowing story and hits you right in the feels So tech,
I was tricked into watching Interstellar. Awesome movie, but no one warned about feels. I don't like those, so now on to cat videos.
@LustboyLoL If you liked Gravity, try Interstellar, it's the movie 'Gravity' if it were on steroids :)
#Interstellar: What a wild ride! Enjoyable movie altogether. Pretty cinematography. Didn't hate Matthew McCounaughey in it, which is a feat.
@diercksmeier Interstellar? Oh yeah. Not a good movie.
Interstellar is hands down the best movie I've seen in a very long time.
@David_Shreve2 INTERSTELLAR is definitely a movie. A pretty good one. But that was a bold prediction.
The movie "Interstellar" = Not........My.........Kind........of.......Movie. Long, drawn out, unrealistic, & boring. Way too long. Sorry....
I love going back and thinking about Interstellar. Makes me think so much about how great life is. Such a great movie.
. @jsausville was playing the #interstellar soundtrack earlier today and now I need to watch that movie with some friends.
Quick #Interstellar update: I started watching this movie like an hour ago. I am now 22 minutes into the movie. #ShortAttentionSpanForMovies
People don't get it when I say interstellar is quite possibly the best movie I've seen. And I've watched a lottttt of movies
@AdrianaLima @MaryMagD1701 @angelcandice @BritishMonarchy @ActorsStudioMFA @Pontifex @KremlinRussia_E Movie Interstellar 1m

I remember the interstellar movie. It was one roller coaster of emotion.
I think interstellar is the only movie ive ever watched through again in full
Interstellar is undeniably the best science movie so far for me. Though it's a sci-fi genre, I believe it is true and the infos are real
Fun Fact: I never thought any movie could ever take LOTR's place as my all time favourite movie, but then, interstellar came along.
Hans Zimmer's soundtracks of interstellar movie awarding neglection is a cruel Oscar's crime.
interstellar is truly a complex, mind bending movie that manipulates our perception of reality pic.twitter.com/ZxpQYz7WHj

Last night I watched interstellar while smoking a footlong joint and it was quite the fantastic movie.
What's worse: Saying THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is your favorite horror movie or that INTERSTELLAR is your favorite sci-fi movie?
I actually sometimes appraise someone's intelligence by whether they understood the movie Interstellar.
Dear brain, please shut up and go to sleep!!!  me — watching Interstellar Movie
I know I'm a year late on seeing it but Interstellar is a fantastic movie
Why is Interstellar the most amazing movie ever
watching Interstellar for the first time (yes don't judge) is this a space movie or is this a Dust Bowl documentry
@ebeesworld interstellar!!!! It's a really long movie
@LogsdonGood comparable to interstellar. Fantastic movie top 10 on dozers top movies list. And Dozer knows movies
if you ever want to watch a movie that will 1000000% destroy your emotions just watch Interstellar.
I have to debate whether interstellar or the martian was my favorite movie. Two highly recommended movies.
Interstellar is such a good movie
I feel like the writers of Interstellar spaced themselves totally retarded considering the final 15 minutes of the movie
The movie Interstellar is so interesting, it amazes me so much.
My Double Feature movie: Interstellar #DoubleTheBenefits Contest: http://ycn.io/double  via @yconicstudent
I did have to watch Interstellar with subtitles on because of some of the worst sound mix choices ever made on a major movie.
Just watched interstellar.. It honestly deserves every single award a movie can get #greatestmovieevermade
Rainy day that entices to watch Interstellar or some out of this world movie.
#interstellar was a good movie second time around as well. Rarely you get to say that these days.
interstellar will still be my favourite movie
I love Interstellar but God I hate Anne Hathaway in that movie.

This game was the movie Interstellar.
Interstellar is such an amazing movie
Interstellar is the most intense, elegantly done movie I've seen in a long time
Interstellar was the most complicated and confusing movie I think I have ever seen
Ridley Scott's "The Martian" is a very good movie. Way better than Interstellar & Gravity in my opinion. 10/10
Nothing will compare to Interstellar but The Martian was an incredible movie!
This movie Interstellar is blowing my fucking mind.
Interstellar, one of the greatest movie I've ever seen, thank you @McConaughey for being such a good actor, cried like a fucking baby

@AKmovieguru your movie reviews are mediocre. interstellar is mediocre. SQUARE UP
Interstellar is a great movie. The best I've seen a long time!...wife fell asleep 45 min into it though, chicks, no appreciation for science
Man those devices that the astronauts use to hibernate in the movie Interstellar were crazy
Holy shit interstellar was a good movie
Not sure how I feel about interstellar... Liked the movie though
Just watched interstellar for the 2nd time, fucking awesome movie!!!
@Qarx We need to do an Interstellar movie night.No relation to a Tesseract! <_< >_> Or a Bootstrap Paradox >_> <_< (...I think he bought it)
Finally watched Interstellar today. Never have I seen a movie have so much potential, and then waste it all with a terrible ending
Feeling an Interstellar movie night soon
interstellar is such a wonderful movie
Interstellar best movie i seen this year
this was the third time i have watched interstellar & i still don't get the whole movie...
In other news, Interstellar is a mindfuck of a movie. If you're into science realism, Def watch it
Interstellar is still the best movie I've seen this year
Interstellar is next in our movie marathon and I'm honestly afraid
It's ironic that Matt Damon had the lead in this movie and was in interstellar. And the similarities between his parts are apparent.
Best movie you've see this year ? Mine is interstellar or whiplash or gone girl
Interstellar right now. Love this movie.
Further comment: @Interstellar had a great idea, but @MartianMovie is a great movie and story.
Interstellar....hell of a movie
Interstellar would be a fantastic movie to watch if you were trippin.
Interstellar is just a movie about how much Matthew Mcconaughey prefers his daughter over his son.
#EDFX 2.3 'Interstellar Feeling' profile will introduce more realistic and colder ambient colors like this monument movie. Stay tuned.
On @treyhudson7 and @Jazzzy__Jeff I rented the movie Interstellar as my movie of the weekend. Hope it's as good as recommended by my dudes.
Interstellar is probably the best movie I've ever watched
I must say the score for this movie is pretty brilliant. #Interstellar
watching interstellar love this movie so much
The movie Interstellar teaches you a lot about connection + love.
What's the difference between a low budget 3rd class space movie & Interstellar? The Budget. They both suck anyway..

Interstellar will stay a great movie
Guys have you watched Interstellar? It's an incredible movie and its soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer simply rocks!!! #interstellar !!!
The movie interstellar fucks me up so bad.
I just watched interstellar and it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen bar none. Seriously I'm emotionally ruined and deeply upset.
After watching Interstellar I can never support a movie with Matt Damon in it again.
Interstellar is by far my favorite movie
Interstellar a pretty stupid awesome movie.
Interstellar is the most thought provoking movie I've ever seen, go watch it & your entire perspective on the world will change.
Made the mistake of getting caught up watching Interstellar again. Man I freaking hate Matt Damon in this movie.

@StuFlemingNZ @sarabeee haven't seen Martian yet. Did enjoy Interstellar- best "farming in the depression" movie since Mice and Men.
i like the interstellar score more than I actually like the movie
Great space movie, right up there with Gravity and Interstellar. Not as sci-fi as Interstellar, not as heavy as Gravity.
INTERSTELLAR WAS ONE HELL OF A MOVIE
The movie Interstellar may be flawed; but it's soundtrack is epic. https://itun.es/gb/SPuV3

Watching Interstellar. This is a great movie! Are wormholes real?
I'm a year late but omg Interstellar is the trippiest most sad movie I have ever seen.
SO. The Martian is a contender right up there with Interstellar for best space movie of the year. Beautiful filmography!
Way late to the party on this, but finally watched Interstellar yesterday. Best movie I've seen in quite a while.

After watching the movie "Interstellar" , I had a headache -.-

@AnnualKat Yea KitKat Interstellar is a really good movie
I loved The Martian but Interstellar was still better. I loved the humor in the movie!
I think if the martian would have been released before Interstellar it would have been perceived way better, a good movie just overshadowed
Still haven't found a new movie since @Interstellar to give you an existential sensation of chills.
once the martian is on netflix who wants to come over & have a space movie marathon & watch that & interstellar & gravity
@doctorORbust @med_stateofmind If you're too groggy to leave, do you have an Xbox? Can u rent a movie? Interstellar. It's very good. & wine

Interstellar is probably the most creative and amazing movie I've ever watched
Interstellar is the coolest movie
Interstellar is the best movie I've ever seen
Interstellar is such an amazing movie everyone should see it
Bruh. Interstellar is Inception on steroids. Good ass movie man.
@ZheelaJ Yes, I initially thought I was looking at pictures of that actor in Interstellar movie until I realized he's the new PM of Canada.
I just introduced my dad to Interstellar. And what does he say after the movie? Not "Wow, great movie!" No. He says, "I want some cereal."
My wife and I just watched Interstellar and now we are starting Inception CUZ ITS LIKE A NOLAN MOVIE WITHIN A NOLAN MOVIE: A 'NOLANCEPTION'

I dunno why but I personally just wish to watch interstellar... Like it was a great movie and I'm in the mood for it..
Just spent 3 hours+ in the bose store watching interstellar in their personal theater room Just sat there and watched the entire movie
Just watched #Interstellar. What a thoroughly enjoyable movie that was. Quite the subwoofer work-out too. Absolutely splendid.
Lamar Odom hires prostitutes to watch Interstellar with him. I would assume he does this so they can explain the movie as he is watching.
interstellar was so good i havent cried this many times during a movie in a while
As much as I like Zimmer's score for Interstellar on its own, I think it sabotages the movie by not fitting picture most of the time.

Interstellar is such a good mind blowing movie
Just watched #TheMartian movie and it's quite fascinating; but not as much as interstellar; despite they can hardly be compared at all

I have watched #Interstellar more than ten times now. And every time I weep like it is the first time. What a movie.

The Martian is an entertaining and interesting movie. I like the light tone they brought to it. But let's face it, this is not Interstellar.
Okay, so someone suggested a movie like Interstellar to me last night... I can't remember who told me or what the movie was called -_-.

Kip Thorne on Interstellar: "One of the things I love about this movie -- all the stars are theoretical physicists."
Listening to the Interstellar soundtrack brings back many memories of the movie.. So intense.. So epic Hanz Zimmer chose the songs well.
The director of Interstellar wondered why the movie was called Krrish 3. So Rakesh Roshan sent him a gift with a note: Krrish-2-for Nolan.
I think the reason @Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time is because it gives us a glimpse into our future,They don't understand yet
Wow interstellar was a amazing movie so well put together
Interstellar is the same movie as 2001: Space Odyssey minus the monkeys but with a different plot. And no pizza.

The movie @Interstellar is basically an updated version of Back To the Future.
