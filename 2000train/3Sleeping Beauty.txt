ya know idk how sleeping beauty was disneys biggest flop it's my favorite princess movie
Sleeping Beauty only appeared on screen for 18 minutes & had 18 lines in her movie, and then there's people thinking sexism doesn't exist...
@LhoBrockhoff I think alot of reviewers had a problem with the movie basically changing the whole story seen in the Sleeping Beauty cartoon.
i just remembered a memory of my 8 yr old self downloading in this sketchy website the movie Sleeping Beauty and played it. It was a porno
Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney movie where the curse sounds amazing.

no, netflix. "sleeping beauty" is not a horror movie.
Disney might make a movie based on my true story cuz I'm about to be sleeping beauty for the next 12 hours
Snow White was the second Disney movie I'd seen after Cinderella. Along with Sleeping Beauty, they will always be special to me. :')
What kind of nerd do I feel like right now: HP audiobook, LotR soundtrack, or animated Sleeping Beauty movie?
Sleeping Beauty is actually a freaking terrifying movie.

@MithayChawl yep. And then he did that Maleficent movie as sleeping beauty s father. Like no Copley, no.
@elisatorres06 Maleficent IS a Disney movie. As is Sleeping Beauty.This is the same lack of continuity as the plot twist in GMW.
Curious why there isn't a sleeping beauty movie?? Why does Cinderella need 10 movies? Like sleeping beauty needs to find Phillip too
tonight's disney movie for vacation prep is maleficent! figured it was good for going to sleeping beauty castle and a villain 10K!

@Disney I really didn't know any of these and I'm a former CM whose favorite Disney movie is Sleeping Beauty! Whoops!
@realKrisG Sleeping Beauty has always been my favorite Disney movie! As a little girl I would sing this song and dance around like she did.
The movie Sleeping Beauty is so unrealistic. Like, you can't live happily ever after with anyone who wakes you up from the best nap ever.
@AngryDisneyNerd and the 2nd movie could be a real remake of Sleeping Beauty
Love this movie — watching Sleeping Beauty

I'm never seeing a Snow White, a Cinderella, or a Sleeping Beauty movie ever again. Dear Disney, let them rest.
''Like Sleeping Beauty was in the classic movie for 18 minutes'' I'm pretty sure seeing her sleeping the whole movie was gonna be boring af
Did anyone else notice that the movie Anastasia is pretty much a remake of Sleeping Beauty.
Sleeping Beauty rehersal and the new Cinderella movie is a great way to spend a Friday night
