The middle aged man sharing my train compartment is reading Gone Girl. I asked how he liked it and he said, "I'm mad I saw the movie first."
Mustapha's point is Gone Girl (he read it before the movie?). Well, let's start with a police investigation and work things out from there.
It will be so sad if she actually lied about this. Would really be a real life gone girl movie.
5 minutes in and the characters in Gone Girl (the movie) are even less likable than 400 pages of the book #how
Gone girl was the movie that broke me. Had me legit scared of women. How did i forget that.. This whole debacle is so similar to the movie.

gone girl has got to be the most twisted movie i've watched all weekend, with so many unanswered questions. will there be another one?
finished watching gone girl after like 8 months after reading the book amazing. book>movie obviously but still amy as psycho as ever
The book/movie Gone Girl except instead of everyone looking for Amazing Amy it's everyone looking for Frank Ocean and his album
"the gift" feels like joel edgerton saw gone girl and was like wow that was great i want to make a movie like that. but he couldn't
Gone Girl was an amazing fucking movie. Loved it.

I'm in the mood to watch a really good movie. A 'Gone Girl' type of movie. Or a tearjerker. Or both.
Just watched "Gone Girl". i wonder how that movie got on so many 'MUST SEE' lists. The amount of things horrible about that film is stunning
As I promised, I watched Gone Girl and as messed up as it is, it's a dope movie @Tavis_Tee I see you still got good taste for a buck
"I think he's gone" - girl in a horror movie when the killer is definitely not gone.
All I hear is amazing things about the movie Gone Girl, but I'll read the book first

Gone girl is pretty much the best movie ever
I haven't read the book, but the movie Gone Girl is horrendous. Am I supposed to hate every character?
@XAnimalCityX @Nypopcorn2 @GraceRandolph @rosamundpike1 I heard Pike was sensational in the movie 'Gone Girl' and she's been a Bond Girl..
