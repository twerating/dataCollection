Bone Tomahawk is in the running for movie of the year. Awesome every way. I highly recommend it.
Bone Tomahawk was a weird movie. Worth a watch though! Poor Saucy :(
I feel like Bone Tomahawk would be a perfect movie for @jaimeburchardt if he hasn't already seen it.
@STSPhonoCo I see you there, and you too! But I'll just bring it to you during Bone Tomahawk movie / bourbon night.

@DDoherty_ Bone Tomahawk is fantastic. Please rent it. Hell, BUY it. It's the best horror movie of the year and it's not a horror movie
Ghastliest Movie Deaths: Aaron Eckhart in THE MISSING; someone (not saying b/c spoilers) in THE COUNSELLOR; yeah, that one in BONE TOMAHAWK.
Re BONE TOMAHAWK: I could watch an entire movie of Russell and Jenkins as a western Bert & Ernie having bedtime conversations.

Bone Tomahawk is, believe, the first Western in which a dude gets ripped in half starting from the dick. Pretty good movie!
@dannyodwyer Bone Tomahawk, it's a western cannibal horror movie. Really brutal.
@BackinJack @huntershea1 Holy fuck. You have to see Bone Tomahawk. Western/horror. Goddamn, this movie got to me. You can rent it on Amazon

I rented bone tomahawk thinking it was a western not a horror movie #blood #guts #nope
Bone Tomahawk is a crazy ass movie
Wish I'd gotten BONE TOMAHAWK in before the end of October, but I hear it's as much a Christmas movie as it is a Halloween movie.
Glad I started drinking after I watched Bone Tomahawk. Would've lost my high watching it. Awesome movie though. Must watch.
I loved a movie. It's called Bone Tomahawk. There's an incredibly gory scene. You might hate it. Richard Jenkins is a national treasure.
Just watched "Bone Tomahawk". Good movie. It seems that Westerns are quite alive.
The movie BONE TOMAHAWK is a great mix of western and horror with a splash of comedy.

Is Bone Tomahawk or western? Is it horror? I can't enjoy a movie if it doesn't fit squarely in an established genre! Help me!
Bone Tomahawk will put hairs on your chest. A belter of a movie that keeps getting better as it goes along.

Bone Tomahawk gets a 7.5/10 from me, takes a while for the action but worth it. Now to watch the Goosebumps movie like a str8 gee!
So thanks to Bone Tomahawk this year we get not only two Kurt Russell westerns but two incongruous Italian cannibal movie throwbacks. Neat.
Watched Bone Tomahawk last night. Some of those images are going to haunt me for some time to come. Good movie. #BoneTomahawk

Who is the maniac who wrote & directed Bone Tomahawk?? Bring him to me at once, he deserves a big hug. That movie is CRAAAAAAZY good.
Nice try Rolling Stone but BONE TOMAHAWK is way more movie than RAVENOUS. Though the RAVENOUS soundtrack remains unmatched.

Hey u fuckers, Bone Tomahawk is a worthy movie
If you want to watch a movie that will give you all the nightmares, may I humbly suggest "Bone Tomahawk"
bone tomahawk might be the most violent movie ive ever seen
BONE TOMAHAWK—favorite movie of the year. With performances by Matthew Fox, Patrick Wilson and Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins stole the show.
Not to be confused with my "best outta nowhere movie from lamest possible title" which went to Bone Tomahawk this year.
So Bone Tomahawk is a movie completely lacking sanity, and it's all the better for it.
Badass western + insane cannibals + epic Kurt Russell mustache = sweet friggin movie. Cannot recommend Bone Tomahawk enough.
Bone Tomahawk. Badass movie. Check it out.

Today’s scary movie – BONE TOMAHAWK from 2015. Kurt Russel and his glorious mustache pursue cannibal troglodytes in the old west. Excellent!
Bone Tomahawk is a strange movie. 90 mins of western & then it takes a HARD left into a fucking cannibal nightmare for the last act.

BONE TOMAHAWK is worth a longer than normal drive. My second favorite movie of the year so far.
BONE TOMAHAWK, a horror western starring Kurt Russell, features one of the goriest deaths I've ever seen in a movie. Absolutely insane.
Just watched Bone Tomahawk, the new Western-horror movie with Kurt Russell. Brilliant and disturbing. Wow.
I just watched Bone Tomahawk and my jaw is fucking hanging. If Fury Road hadn't come out this year, it would be my favorite movie of 2015.
Did not realize Bone Tomahawk was a horror movie. It's like the one movie I'm interested in seeing. Well crap.
Just a reminder that Bone Tomahawk -- the best movie of the year not titled Fury Road -- is now available on VOD.
BONE TOMAHAWK is streamable & I think I'm gonna watch that later. 1st I need movie supplies!

#BoneTomahawk Do you need a movie to scare you this month? Review: ‘Bone Tomahawk’ Is Western, Horror and Comedy http://nyti.ms/1kxnT0C 
Just saw a great fucking movie. Too bad it's barely playing anywhere. Goddam. If Bone Tomahawk is playing anywhere near you, check it out.
BONE TOMAHAWK should not be relegated to the Burbank 8 like some bad Bruce Willis or Nic Cage tax credit movie.
Check out Bone Tomahawk - it's the Kurt Russell VS Cannibals western movie we've been waiting for.

Bone Tomahawk was awesome. Brutal, engaging, and surprisingly funny when it wasn't bloody as hell. Totally a #FantasticFest movie. @cclegit
Shout out to DARK BLUE in the BONE TOMAHAWK Q&A! Kurt Russell's hair is God Status in that movie.
Richard Jenkins owned BONE TOMAHAWK and he is OWNING the post-movie q&a. #FantasticFest
BONE TOMAHAWK is the breeziest 2 hour and 15 minute movie I've ever seen. It's brilliantly paced.
If you really love westerns with a little horror thrown in BONE TOMAHAWK is just about the perfect movie. #FantasticFest
BONE TOMAHAWK! That was a mighty fine movie. Now there's a Q&A with awesome talent + Tim #FantasticFest! pic.twitter.com/CkPoZB2zPl
Bone Tomahawk's not even an ok movie, let alone the movie that's being described to you by the reactions from that Fantastic Fest screening.
Bone Tomahawk: a terrific throwback to old studio westerns that turns into a brutal and mean horror flick. This movie rules. #FantasticFest
Bone Tomahawk is a really fun men-on-a-mission movie with a very cool subdued central performance from Kurt Russell #FantasticFest
Awesome to see Matthew Fox's new movie Bone Tomahawk trending on Twitter.
#FantasticFest Final Movie: BONE TOMAHAWK

Almost time for my last movie of #FantasticFest, "cannibalistic western" BONE TOMAHAWK, starring Kurt Russell
One last movie to end #Fantastic Fest.... Bone Tomahawk. Then it's the closing festival party. #bittersweet
Final movie of the festival, BONE TOMAHAWK, is up next. #FantasticFest
BONE TOMAHAWK- best movie title ever? Jealous of those Fantastic Fest folks that are seeing it tonight...
Bone Tomahawk is a major letdown. The movie squanders Kurt Russell's performance. He's great, but the movie is not.
Last day of movie camp : THE WAVE, DARLING, LOVE & PEACE, BONE TOMAHAWK (thx @mistertodd!), PARTY. #FantasticFest
Up early to make it a 5 movie final day at #FantasticFest: -- BONE TOMAHAWK -- EVOLUTION -- DARLING -- 8 DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER -- SOUTHBOUND
It's safe to say that the year's coolest movie title is, by a landslide, BONE TOMAHAWK, right?

I always maintained Kurt Russell is the king of the solid "B" Movie, and this year's BONE TOMAHAWK & THE HATEFUL EIGHT look to support that.
My most anticipated movie of FF - Green Room - plays twice. Once up against a secret screening and the 2nd time versus Bone Tomahawk #fuck
