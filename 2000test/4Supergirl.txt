So....The Martian Manhunter doesn't make the Batman V Superman movie, so they put him in the Supergirl show? I see what you're doing DC
Caught up on Supernatural, now it's time to watch Supergirl. Then back to Once Upon A Time till movie night. pic.twitter.com/KSOmN8Lrsk
That character reveal in Supergirl was great but it sucks that this character probably won't be getting his own show or movie.
@JonSchnepp #colliderheroes Now that Martian Manhunter is on Supergirl does that increase or decrease the chances for him in the JL movie?
can we just think about how good the justice league movie could be?Martian manhunter was introduced in supergirl, and Jason momoa is aquaman
TV #Supergirl is 1,000,000 times the inspirational superhero movie Superman is.
Literally cried when I saw Martian Manhunter on #Supergirl Felt like I was 8 years old watching the Justice League movie again.
Ugh I want to say stuff about Supergirl but spoilers! Suffice it to say, the DC TV crowd gets this universe WAY better than the movie crowd

@Mister_Batfleck Well if Supergirl is cancelled after one season, that'll leave him to the JL if that Cybrog movie turns into the Titans
I'm shocked they are letting J'onn J'onzz be on #Supergirl with the #JusticeLeague movie coming. @wbpictures usually hate TV/Movies clashing
So...yeah. #Supergirl the TV series is 100 times better than #Superman the movie. And I've only seen 2 episodes.
Why is he in Supergirl & not in the JL movie? https://twitter.com/superherofeed/status/674046249230815232 …

#Supergirl just brought us a live action #MartianManHunter! @DCComics TV is so good lately, their movie studio needs to take notes.
Superman may have used the solar flare first in the comics but #Supergirl is the first to do it in a movie or TV show
"No, but I played one in a movie franchise" #Supergirl
This is like a damn horror movie. #supergirl
This looks like a job for Superman. If only he didn't have a movie coming out... #Supergirl

@darthtardis Slott likes Supergirl and hates a movie he hasn't seen. I don't think you could spell "M-O-R-O-N" in bigger letters.
There was a scene in tonight's Supergirl that was as cinematic as anything in a major superhero movie.
audiences have to 'choose' between Jessica Jones and Supergirl meanwhile Batman vs Superman is an actual movie. w gay subtext but still.

@fleur_de_livres that sounds cool, and possibly even to work in the DC movie/TV stuff that leads to no superman in supergirl?
They better not make a "Flash" or a "SuperGirl"movie. Trash series the both of them.

I'm fiddin' ta watch Helen Slater's #Supergirl movie right after this.
We second that! It truly is like a new movie every week #Supergirl https://twitter.com/MehcadBrooks/status/666474058423255040 …
And we thought your movie could carry the franchise. Looks like we're both wrong. #Supergirl
Notice something very ironic funny. Both DC shows Supergirl & Gotham r version of there former 80s & 90s movie version selves.
OMG...the actor playing the mom on #Supergirl is the same one who played #BillyJean in the movie named the same. She looks great
One of the things I enjoy most about #Supergirl is the fact that we don't have to acknowledge the existence of the Man of Steel movie.
Man @chy_leigh always does a superb job in the emotional scenes on whatever show or movie she's in. #Supergirl
how kara's mom in this show played supergirl in the movie I Love That
What was everyone trying to protect #Supergirl *from*? She couldn't possibly be hurt, as far as anyone knew. #Superman movie, same question!

That episdoe of supergirl was simply amazing....that 1 episode might have been better than the entire Man of steel movie #Supergirl
I want to love #Supergirl but why does every conversation have to be about #SuperMan. I thought #feminism came a ways since the movie.
#cbs #Supergirl reminds me the #movie The devil wears Prada. #CalistaFlockhart is Miranda Priestly and #MelissaBenoist is Andy Sachs
Now that's some creepy horror movie type bad guy #Supergirl
Considering how ungenerous DC is with movie characters being on TV, is Maxwell Lord not gonna be in the WW movie, since he's on #Supergirl?
I like the Supergirl series, I'm just really worried it'll lead some innocent person into accidentally seeing the movie.
@CertainshadesL Supergirl movie was my first Superman media EVER & I've always loved it. So, I know Supergirl can stand on its own [2/2}

Good to read many tweets of people watching #Supergirl remembering of #CaptainMarvel! Thanks DC, Its increasing our movie hype!
Supergirl has all the hopeful tone I wish a Superman movie had, but every week
@CertainshadesL it's too bubbly, Kara is boring, WW movie is still struggling (except it's not). Like there are so many women in #Supergirl
I think if Supergirl is successful, DC will quit isolating it. Either w/movie stuff or Arrow/Flash, if it's good, it'll join up.
Dang, this is like a new hourlong movie every week. Cliffhangers are LEGIT. #Supergirl #TVwithTV
Warner could produce a Superman movie written by me with complete creative control and I'd still be more excited that Supergirl's on TV now.

I enjoyed Man of Steel. Supergirl is giving me what I really wanted out of that movie.
Damn. #Supergirl moves *quickly*. Pacing needs to slow down. Pilot was like a 2 1/2 hour movie in 60 minutes. Slow down.

Watching Supergirl it's such a good movie omg I love it now
People think the CGI in Supergirl is bad? Really? I mean it's not movie-level but come on.
Just started watching #Supergirl and I knew #DeanCain is her dad, had no idea the actress who played Movie Supergirl is her mum! So good!

If Supergirl continues to succeed as a tv show than the Black Widow would succeed as a movie am i right?

Really, if the rating for Supergirl continue strong, I can see Melissa growing into a movie star, possibly included in Justice League pt 2.

Watched the new #supergirl series last night & loved it! But I grew up with the movie so I'm totally biased. Might not be everyone's thing
I am just so pleased that shows like #TheFlash and #Supergirl exist. At a time when the bad superhero movie genre is slowly dying down.
Supergirl gets rave reviews in my house. Max declares it "better than any Superman movie", Tessa blasts him with heat vision and flies away
I could never see any of the lead actors in flash or arrow (let alone gotham/supergirl) working together w/ superman/batman in a movie

Just watched the pilot for Supergirl. This. This is what I want a Superperson show/movie to be. Endlessly optimistic and hopeful.
If I had ABC Id of mayb tried SuperGirl. As it stands, I just watched the I Spy movie on Grit Owen Wilsons great in that& the gorgeous Famke
And yes, I know the #Supergirl movie from 1984 was supposedly awful, but still -- Helen Slater and Jerry Goldsmith, y'all!
@LightsWasHere TV =SuperGirl. (Maybe at Party Land) Anime =L from Death Note (Because it's literally a white shirt & jeans) Movie=Kung Fury.
after the sexist #Supergirl movie back in the day I am a little apprehensive about the show. Should I give it a shot?
Supergirl proves that Greg Berlanti ought to be running DC's movie-verse, too. Imagine if he was in charge of Superman, too.
The problem with  #Supergirl was trying to do what was basically a movie in 45 minutes.  But they mostly did that.
High ratings for Supergirl premiere & good buzz on G-rated Peanuts Movie is a positive sign for family entertainment pic.twitter.com/C0J2uZnyd0

To be fair, literally every other TV/movie version of Superman, Supergirl, Superboy, Krypto, etc is better than MAN OF STEEL.
The Supergirl pilot was about superheroes so my interest was capped, but Melissa Benoist was amazing. A great B-movie performance.

@SageTerrence No, this movie is not for kids. Kids can watch Flash & Supergirl every week.
I may or may not have already downloaded Supergirl months ago. Anyway, love the show, has optimistic spirit of the original Superman movie.
Saw the #Supergirl pilot last night and really liked it. For more "girl of steel" action we have the movie and several of the comic books!
Will the succes of the Supergirl premiere give a go to a female superheros movie ? (not a link to any articles, just a genuine thought)
Had to pause Supergirl after the fun, first 15 min to watch all 3 Man of Steel trailers. Those Nolan trailers fooled me into a Snyder movie.
@iBid4Storage Nope, it was a movie. Women don't need made up superpowers and costumes though in a series, we already have them. #Supergirl
Jenna Dewan Tatum http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/name/name/nm1564087/ … Jenna has role on #Supergirl episode one. Watch Jenna and Tatum dance on movie clip.
@red_my_letter Because of the ’84 movie, I might have an unnatural love for Supergirl.
Supergirl looks like a movie by feminists
@ArdoOmer Yeah, it's complicated here too--I do remember loving TERRIBLE movies I saw as kid (the Supergirl movie being one) on a gut level.
@flickeringmyth so pleased to see a Supergirl movie
#Supergirl was good! I am a HUGE fan of the 80's movie so I'm very happy about this show!!
We live in a world that has Supergirl, the Flash and Green Arrow on television and they are all better than any superhero movie out there.

Not really a superhero movie/comic fan but still psyched to watch the #Supergirl pilot tonight (yay for VPN, nay for time zones)
Definitely better than the movie. Melissa Benoist could become a crush... #Supergirl
@AJBulldis @NoMaaam there was already one supergirl movie that bombed. There is the animated female heroes, Buffy, Katniss, Wonder Woman...
Find it funny that everyone is complaining about DC not making a #Supergirl title, but yell at Marvel for starting a title close to a movie
Am I the only one thinking the #Supergirl pilot was everything the Man of Steel movie should've been?
Some people aren't happy because the guy who's gonna play Jimmy Olsen in the new Supergirl movie, is a black guy. Who gives a flying fuck?
@ermlikeyeah Yet to see The Flash, but expect the same from Supergirl. It really did hark back to Superman: The Movie, very likeable.
@EllenJMiller @Angelheartnight There was a Birds of Prey series so it isn't as if this is the first one ever. Supergirl even had a movie.
I hope that the new found interest in Supergirl doesn't start people thinking that the movie was underrated. pic.twitter.com/xYR6cncFGi
Wow, loved #Supergirl. She's like what Superman should be like in the movie universe. @MelissaBenoist owned it!
Is Helen Slater the lead role in the Supergirl movie before is the sister of Cara or Kara in this series? #supergirlonetc
@MehcadBrooks @supergirlcbs wipes clean the very mixed bag that was the previous Supergirl movie. Except Peter O'Toole who was awesome :)

So, who here has seen "Supergirl" the original movie in the theater? Back then? Opening weekend? Other than me?
There are plenty of nods and homages to Superman the movie and Superman 2. That's not a bad thing #Supergirl
The #Supergirl pilot feels like a fun Supergirl movie in 45 minutes. It could have been a two-parter but...here we are, SUPERHERO TIME!!!
one thought about #supergirl. when lois and clark came on the idea was it would be a romcom because epic movie sfx couldnt be done 1/
The holo-projector also has that movie-vibe. Looks kinda like Argo City, in fact. #Supergirl
The great thing about #Supergirl is how much FUN she is having, in a day where every superhero movie is dark & gritty it's a relief.
You know what I love doing? Imagining a Wonder Woman/SuperGirl movie with Eve Torres as Wonder Woman and Taylor Swift as SuperGirl.
The...crystal fin detail reminds me of the wand from the 80s movie. <3 #Supergirl
@CearaRobin I always felt supergirl was redundant. Much more curious about the wonder woman movie they plan to make.

@LizzyDanger It shows if you put effort into Supergirl, people will watch it. Unlike the movie.
If they were capable of feeling shame, the DC movie team should be mortified that SUPERGIRL just mopped the floor with them in a CBS show.

Gonna watch #Supergirl. I'm a huge #Superman nerd but I never at all got into his cousin. Saw the movie back in the day, that's about it.
That was a cool airplane rescue scene!!! Reminds me of Superman rescuing Lois Lane from the helicopter in the 1st movie! #Supergirl
Movie & #comicbook writers take note @supergirlcbs has EVERYTHING #Superman movies & comics should Excitement action & FUN #Supergirl
And while Agent Carter nails this too, it had a whole movie and a one-shot to set up. Supergirl had a half hour to hit every major beat.
15 minutes in, SUPERGIRL *really* moves. Feels like they trimmed a movie into one episode, but working so far. Benoist is going to be HUGE.

@MelissaBenoist You did great! Tonight was also the first Supergirl I've watched since the '80s movie as a child. =)
I missed #supergirl but I'll catch up ASAP. Excited to have a better version of her on screen than the movie -- so not Helen Slater's fault!
#Supergirl reminds me of Superman: The Movie in all the best ways and I love it.
@MildlyAmused it's funny cause the Supergirl pilot was way better than the hundred million dollar budget MOS movie and they still defend it
Why didn't #Supergirl show scenes from the movie when superman was sent to earth or mention his name or show his face ever it's @DCComics?
Ok, I'm enjoyed #Supergirl it has potential. It reminded me of when I was a kid and liked the movie.
Even tho they can't say his name, the way the #Supergirl show talks about Superman, he's the proper Supes, not the imposter from the movie.

@AmyVernon a lot of this feels a bit by-the-numbers from 1st Chris Reeve Supes movie, but it's still fun #Supergirl #SupGirl
Bwah-ha-ha. Taken right out of the Christopher Reeve Superman movie. #Supergirl
RT @RogerSneed: Damn, this is straight up from Superman: the Movie! I love it! #Supergirl

Ooooh, villain doing the Lex Luthor challenge thing from the first Superman movie! *takes a shot* #Supergirl
Nice homage to Superman the Movie. #Supergirl
I never thought I'd be in a place in my life where I'm more excited about the Supergirl TV show than a Batman/Superman movie.
#Movie Supergirl, Batman, Spider-Gwen, Storm, The Flash, The Worst X-Man Ever http://dlvr.it/CYpX87 
Really enjoying the #Supergirl premiere. Not nearly as corny as previews made it seem. Has the original Superman movie feel.
DC using the Danvers name in #Supergirl has to be a little jab at #Marvel and the upcoming #CaptainMarvel movie.
So, this new @supergirlcbs has #HelenSlater (the movie Supergirl from the 80's, yes?) and Dean Cain (Clarke?). Cute. @chy_leigh #thebest
Sidenote, Chyler Leigh hasn't aged a bit since "Not Another Teen Movie" & "That 80s Show" #Supergirl
Is this #Supergirl or a #NancyMeyers movie? That city apartment is almost as fake as all this cgi flying. @supergirlcbs
#supergirl observation #1: Between this and the most recent movie, Kryptonian women are awesome.
#BlackWidow can't fly, but her movie can @Marvel. Because my daughters needed #Supergirl, and all the super women. https://twitter.com/TristinaWright/status/658809278334181380 …
They should have made #Supergirl a movie reboot before the TV series.
@itsRodT #Supergirl #SupGurl Devil Wears Prada is a brilliant movie. Who says that's an insult?
I don't understand why @lifetimetv doesn't get into the #ComicBook TV Movie game. Cross over event #SUPERGIRL #TheFlash #Arrow #Constantine
So odd question, if Supergirl is tied to MoS, does that mean DC has a united TV and movie universe? #Supergirl
The roof helipad is a call back to the 1st #Superman movie. #Supergirl
No lie: I watched the Supergirl movie A LOT. Fucking Faye Dunaway, you guys.
The movie #SUPERGIRL (Helen Slater) & TV's Superman (Dean Cain) as Kara's parents! https://twitter.com/JarettSays/status/658803819640442880 …
When Dean Cain and Helen the original #Supergirl from the movie play you parents it’s LEGIT <3333 https://twitter.com/ShipperJunkie/status/658805529519726592 …
WB movie folk, watch your TV shows and take note. Superheroes should smile. #Supergirl
17 min in and you've nicely paid homage to both Superman: The Movie and Superman Returns. Well done, #Supergirl
#Supergirl is likea mini movie. Excellent production values and suspense! #SupGurl
#Supergirl is feeling very Richard Donner-esque. Glad I happened to watch Superman: The Movie last night.
Guess it's also a homage to the plane scene in the original movie #Supergirl
How long did it take him in the movie? An hour? Took her 15 minutes on TV and she's kicking his ass. #Supergirl
So the parents of Supergirl in the new tv show are Dean Cain (Superman) and Helen Slater (Supergirl from the 1980′s movie).
They're doing a nice job of paralleling (quickly) the development in the 1978 #Superman movie. #Supergirl
#Supergirl A few minutes in and already more action than the entire Superman Returns movie lol
I love that Kara's foster parents on Supergirl were played by Helen Slater and Dean Cain. Great nods to the movie and tv series.
Your friendly reminder that the 80s Supergirl movie is actually better than you probably think it is. Better than Superman 3 or 4 by far.
I probably will start watching Supergirl. Here is hoping it's better than the last Superman movie. #Supergirl
RT if you woulda seen the movie with cute coworker. (Can I RT my own tweet?) #supergirl #tvwithtv pic.twitter.com/oS9HxbMoJM
I'm assuming you guys never saw the Supergirl movie starring Helen Slater who just made a cameo. #Supergirl
Watching Supergirl and just waiting on Superman's new movie
@bairfanx And movie Supergirl is Kara's mom. Amusing casting gag.

Yay! Kudos to having the woman who starred as Supergirl in the movie play this Supergirl's adoptive mother! #Supergirl
Nice how they honored the previous Supergirl movie and the Lois and Clark series #Supergirl
How trippy that Helen Slater (Supergirl movie) & Dean Cain (Lois & Clark) are playing Kara's adoptive parents.
Her parents were Supergirl from the movie and Superman from the show oh my god #Supergirl
Love that the cameo actress that plays her mom is the actress from the Supergirl movie from the 80's. Yes, I love that movie.
Wait was that the woman who played Supergirl in the movie ?
Origin recap! Movie quality FX! #Supergirl #teamkara
Regardless how this do, it can't be as bad as the movie we got... right? ...right? #Supergirl
It's already looking visually stunning! Movie caliber. #Supergirl
have to say, excited for #Supergirl premiere. Loved the movie as a kid, can't wait to see a female superhero. Here we go!
I love flashbacks of Krypton on any show or movie. #Supergirl #DCComics
@alexthoth There is plenty of room for both. I hope the Captain Marvel movie is good and I hope Supergirl is good and I hope both successful
Be sure to catch Supergirl tonight! The first episode is amazing! Everything you ever wanted from a Supes show/movie and never got. #OOCToo

i don't know how the show will do,but the original #supergirl movie is a serious guilty pleasure of mine. Faye Dunaway's performance is epic
Everyone disappointed about the terrible Jem movie, watch Supergirl tonight. Execs need to know QUALITY female-led stuff is appreciated.
@ people who want a Black Widow/female hero movie, watch Supergirl tonite on Global @ 8:30. We need to prove there's an audience for it.
#Supergirl premieres tonight (& I liked it) but let me take a minute to honor ICONIC Faye Dunaway in the 1984 movie pic.twitter.com/NdlXJlu5En
Twitter is going on about some "Suicide Squad" movie or something and I'm just like IS IT TIME FOR #Supergirl YET!?
@Jamistarme daughter & i are looking forward to the show tonight.just hope theymake it not campy like the supergirl movie .it will be a hit

Ah, I see now why the Supergirl pilot is a clone of the SNL Black Widow Movie skit - a misogynistic a-hole wrote it.
The Jem movie may have been a disgrace to female driven media everywhere, but it's okay cuz tonight is SUPERGIRL
@istyashow Given the new television show starting up, maybe it'd be timely to try the #Supergirl movie from 1984 out?
Last night I watched the 2013's Superman movie, Right before The new TV series, "Supergirl".
@ColleenDoran Same excuse used to "justify" a lack of a WW movie up to this point. Another reason I'm hoping Supergirl does really well.
Ugh yeah I'm finishing this movie but only so I never have to see it again. Tomorrow I will cleanse my brain of it with Supergirl premiere.
Somewhere, a feminists is plotting victimization because #Supergirl is coming out as a tv series instead of a movie.
In honor of the new #SuperGirl TV show starting, I busted out the "classic" #SuperGirl movie & reviewed it https://youtu.be/3m8N491Viek 
Supergirl movie? What's next, a female that doesn't clean?
People are saying supergirl is amazing. Same people told you that smosh movie was hilarious
When I see trailers for Supergirl, all I can think of is the 1984 movie bomb. I'll watch episode one, anyway.
I perceive Supergirl as yet another comic book-based TV show or movie I won't be watching.
so there's actually gonna be a supergirl movie lol

Supergirl the vintage show and or movie flopped. And today it will do the same. Xena was a television Queen tho hahahaha
That movie Supergirl looks stupid af..
I love it how superman is more masculine, and like seems a lot more stronger, and the new movie is called Supergirl yet its an adult
We've made progress. And it will probably get better with the Supergirl, Captian Marvel and Wonder Woman movie's etc.

@SuperNerds_UK I liked the Supergirl movie and the TV pilot
The "Man of Steel Prequel" movie for Supergirl, I am 50/50 in creative influence. And I leave you this hint.
They doing a supergirl movie! Looks more like a chick flick tho
I think I've seen the actress who will play supergirl fromanother movie. I just dont know what movie and what her name is.

stargirl and supergirl need to chastely but sincerely hold hands and go to age-appropriate movie dates

@EricBlazore True, but that was just a bad movie all around. Supergirl has the potential of being actually good.

Usually dislike the "looks like bad cosplay" criticism of movie superhero costumes, but in the case of Supergirl's Red Tornado, it's spot on
People shading supergirl this early on are no fun... Ofc it's not gonna look as good as huge budget movie productions.
Supergirl was whooping Darkseid's ass in this movie omg

@AniSharmin there has never been a superhero show or movie explicitly targeting a female audience before and Catwoman and previous Supergirl

All in all, #Supergirl and the way it's been executed puts far more effort into presenting movie-credible girlness than superness.
I wonder why they're so afraid of having Superman's presence on #Supergirl Perhaps because people would prefer him to the movie version?
Here for the superhero movie/show era but get Supergirl the entire fuck outta here.
De todas maneras, #Supergirl toma libremente de Man of Steel (film y Byrne), Superman the movie, Supergirl the movie. Y Smallville .
i actually thought that Supergirl was a movie but it's not!!! it's a freaking series yasssss
Ah well. I got my Supergirl movie from the 80's.
I don't care what anyone says I'm so here for Supergirl but I would live for a Wonderwoman show/movie as well #nerdland

Callback and homages are fine, but when you resort to blatantly ripping off the Richard Donner movie, you're simply lame. #Supergirl
Supergirl used to be my fav movie.The trailer 4 the series looked a bit silly, but had 2 check it out.Turns out it wasn't 2 bad! #supergirl

Pausing the supergirl pilot at about 14 minutes in coz family wants to go see a movie. Will finish it tonight a record a video for it.
The pilot episode of Supergirl is like a fast-forwarded movie version of the same, a crappy one.
The villain in #Supergirl wants to kill Kara to avenge Krypton I swear this plotline was in a Zack Snyder movie or something
Also, it's not like #Supergirl was headed to Netflix, or the movie theatre. You could just tune in and watch it when it's on!
#supergirl from #DCcomics new trailer has some tasteful shots up, kind of interested in seeing the movie now. http://sungsuong.club/index.php?twg_album=Melissa+Benoist&twg_show=9OQNaQv.jpg …
@SalSaysWhat But speaking of Supergirl. I'm waiting for ComicPOP to do a Comic Commentary on the old Supergirl movie. :)

Saya suka video @YouTube http://youtu.be/KEvEsOxfjgE?a  Watch "Supergirl" Full Movie High Quality Online
This should have started as a movie imo. - Watch "Supergirl - First Look" on YouTube - https://youtu.be/Lm46-envrHo 
omg may supergirl na movie sheeeeeeet omg haha
Watched a bit of Catwoman tonight. Holy balls that movie really is the worst movie ever made. New Supergirl will be similar lol.
WB needs @GBerlanti oversee the DC movie universe & give him a committee. He caters to the characters. Supergirl looks better than MoS imo
The supergirl trailer is almost identical to the black widow movie trailer snl made . Go watch both and come back to me
Showed my niece the Supergirl trailer. "It's going to be a show, not a movie?" "This is cool. I can't wait!"
that show for supergirl looks almost exactly like snl's spoof of a black widow movie
Did nobody ever see the #Supergirl movie she neva came from krypton, that was in outer space she lived in innerspace....
They had Black Widow do a parody of a solo Female Superhero movie on SNL and the Supergirl trailer looks exactly like it LOL
Supergirl! Hopefully, it will do better than the movie which came out in the 1980s when I was a kid. I thought it... http://fb.me/3S4IxkNFs

@JonSchnepp #amcheroes is SUPERGIRL on cbs part of DCU TV or movie universe because the trailer is mixed
today i rewatched Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. this animated movie is damn good! Supergirl kicked Darkseid's butt
Supergirl is connected to Man of Steel but also to @CW_TheFlash, so shouldn't the Flash movie star @grantgust and put him in Justice League

Wasn't at all excited about this Supergirl movie but the trailer persuaded me otherwise... It looks fun!
I finally saw the trailer for the supergirl show and it reminded me a lot of a Disney channel movie commercial
With the imminent arrival of the TV show, please tell me there will be a blu-ray release of #Supergirl the original movie... #bluray
They made a movie about my life..LOL, New #Supergirl trailer.. http://bit.ly/1Hk51vf 
I think it's addressed in the movie when Supergirl questions why she's called Supergirl.
Wow the new Supergirl movie looks alright! It's obviously a chick movie tho! Atleast they talk about Superman in this movie
Omg #Supergirl trailer! How did i not know about this & w/ Calista #AllyMcBeal ! I loved the 80s Supergirl movie! https://youtu.be/Lm46-envrHo 
Not digging the whole Supergirl thing.. Movie looks terrible. Love the idea of a superwoman movie but this looks like crap
@TheSaturnyne I was thinking the new Supergirl trailer looked very "Devil Wears Prada", which I loved. The movie, not the book.
supergirl next movie please
@web_supergirl I cooked dinner then watched a movie. Had to put the Twitter down.

Really Supergirl movie? We can't have a female superhero without her being insecure and basically making the movie into a romcom? =/
So, folks are saying that the trailer for the #Supergirl tv series looks like a rom-com? Have they seen the first Spider-Man movie?
what is this i hear about a supergirl movie
the Supergirl trailer makes me wanna light myself on fire thx Hollywood for turning a movie about a strong female hero into a romcom!!!!!!!!
@RealDeanCain Really wished SuperGirl was made when you were acting as Superman, would of really loved a movie sequel w/u2 in it. #Fall

Rt my bro pointed something out, the parody trailer for the 'Black Widow movie' on SNL is almost identical to the trailer for Supergirl
The #Supergirl trailer looked just like the SNL Parody of a Black Widow Movie - Tom Welling was never a klutz wtf show
the trailer for supergirl is honestly sooooo long and revealed so much of the plot you dont even have to watch the movie anymore

Super excited for the new #Supergirl tv show. I know it feels like a rom-com movie with action but I'm all for it. I like light shows.
Woaa Supergirl trailer is way Better than whole Man of steel movie! Looking forward for this CBS… [pic] — https://path.com/p/1fa6Bm 
the supergirl trailer had a light-hearted Devil Wears Prada feel like WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA!!!! THAT MOVIE IS AMAZING

Someone did an edit of the Supergirl trailer to take out "the bubbly stuff." Congrats on making a generic, bland action movie trailer...
The fact that SNL made a joke about a super heroine movie then the supergirl TV show looks just like the joke really bothers me.
I have so many mixed feelings about the supergirl movie but I'm not rly going to voice any of them before I actually see the movie, ya feel?
Is Supergirl going to be a tv show or a movie? Either way, DC needs to start making better movies for their heroes.
When you realise Supergirl looks like the Black widow movie SNL sketch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm46-envrHo … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_5KgpN38hM …
#SuperGirl trailer is like watching the whole movie, hope its not another girls drama. HAHA!! Just so-so not so excited about the main girl
I hope the Supergirl show is truly, truly outrageous, since the Jem movie won't be. I need that feeling again!
Last week: SNL spoofs a “Black Widow” movie https://youtu.be/j_5KgpN38hM  This week: CBS’ releases a “Supergirl” teaser https://youtu.be/Lm46-envrHo 
oh my god the supergirl first look is literally the same as the snl black widow movie parody im fucking dying theyre so DUMB
there's a supergirl movie :///
That Supergirl movie trailer sure was fun! I hope the movie is tht good.
but pls those cartoons taught me that if Supergirl were to make a movie about herself it most probably would be chick flick anyway
@brandtkurowski tldr; Gen-X dudes probably got no idea what is right for a Supergirl movie. ;)

@pathfnder wow!!! Chiti I really want to watch this movie. Now I got two movies to wait for #Supergirl and #PaperTowns
Also, the advent of the new Supergirl flick is just another way of the universe DEMANDING a Kamala Khan #MsMarvel movie.
Not really into the new DC movie "Supergirl". But seeing Calista Flockhart in the movie, well..

@beranek I don't. Not unless they reboot their movie universe. Don't want that Supergirl show to have any connection to Man of Steel.
the trailer for supergirl looks soooo bad tho like how hard is it to have one good female super hero show/movie
hey remember that SNL skit making fun of what Black Widow's movie would be because of Marvel's sexism yea that's exactly what Supergirl is
Supergirl the movie and Superman IV not only had the worse effects it had the worse script ever.No one could save it.

Asa buttface is Spidey that dumb glee girl is supergirl on the show Ben affleck (whom I love BUT) is batman GRANT GUSTIN IS NOT MOVIE FLASH
@frankpallotta as a friend put it - fun, ditzy Supergirl and the City is not what people are looking for from a superheroine series/movie.
I've just watched the trailer (mini movie more like) for Supergirl. Erm, aimed at kids I reckon.
I'm one of those fans who has grown to dislike almost every comic movie/show trailer from the start. And I'm totally digging Supergirl.
and the devil wears prada was a great movie! so if supergirl turns out to be ANYTHING like it, then great. stop acting like ur insulting
Why does the #Supergirl trailer look staggeringly like the SNL Black Widow solo movie parody?
kara zor-el was literally my first superhero. like literally. i don't remember how by my mom let me watch the 1984 supergirl movie.
Intriguing. Hopefully it makes up for the 80's Supergirl movie. http://moviehole.net/201590300first-look-supergirl … @CBS @Supergirltvsite @DCComics

We feel that Batman v Supergirl would be a drastically different, but equally entertaining movie. #Supergirl pic.twitter.com/4Ki3tik2RW
Also, saw the supergirl trailer and that shit looks more like a comedy movie than a serious show like arrow or flash. HAD 2 B SAID.
I love the Supergirl trailer. :3 I did love the Supergirl movie when I was a kid.
@hater_raid I hope it makes us forget the Helen Slater 1980s Supergirl movie. I'm geeked too.
>.> I was watching the supergirl promo like "this is neat but it seems more like a TV series than a movie..." I'm bad at reading <.<
To be clear, I would also watch the hell out of that SNL Black Widow romcom movie. #Supergirl
The mindless, sexist comments on the Supergirl trailer are EXXACTLY why we haven't had a Ms. Marvel or Wonder Woman movie yet.
the supergirl trailer is my favorite movie of 2015
ok but why does the supergirl trailer look like the parody black widow movie trailer snl made
Omg i'm not no into superheroes but Supergirl soo excited for this movie https://www.facebook.com/DCEntertainmentMultiverse/videos/813615022021807/ …
Not to be mean about the #Supergirl movie. But it's kind of reminding me of that parody trailer of the Black Widow movie
It needs to be said look at DC and how they approach female heroes. Supergirl tv show, Sara/Nyssa/Thea/Laurel Arrow, Wonder Woman movie,etc
wait supergirl is going to be a show? not a movie? :|
Just watched supergirl trailer and I'm a bit upset. Looks like more "Devil Wears Prada" and T-Swift songs than an action movie. #Supergirl
