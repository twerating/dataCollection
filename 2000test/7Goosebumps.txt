In my opinion, I thought PEANUTS was adorable. And GOOSEBUMPS was action packed. So different in each movie type description.
Movie itself was pretty good tho. Loved all the references to the Goosebumps books, a big flashback to my childhood days.
Bad headache and tired out at work. Maybe yesterday's late-night Goosebumps movie wasn't such a good idea...

GOOSEBUMPS is a heartfelt look into creativity, but it's dressed up for Halloween as a silly popcorn monster movie. Works on both levels.
I think the true scary message of the GOOSEBUMPS movie is this: writers can be pretty damn lonely.
