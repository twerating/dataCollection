Also the marketing campaign for this movie (for what they showed, what they didn't) was the best for a blockbuster since the the Dark Knight
Can't wait for fans' excitement over the new Star Wats being critically passable turns it into the Best Movie Ever, a la The Dark Knight

Guys, the dark knight is literally the perfect movie.
Christopher Nolan first pitched Inception to the movie studios 9 years ago, but put it aside while he made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight
Just rewatched Empire Strikes Back aka the best movie not titled The DARK KNIGHT.
Forever the best movie will be the dark knight with Heath Ledger as the Joker. Legendary movie greatest acting I've ever seen

The Dark Knight is timeless. Will always be THE best Batman movie and one of the greatest movie's ever. RIP Heath Ledger - a true legend.
Watching The Dark Knight for the umpteenth time. Absolutely love this movie. One of the greatest made this century. #whysorserious

The last ten minutes of the dark knight rises will forever be my favorite ten minutes of any movie, ever
@MatthewSardo so it's like the bomb timer gun in the Dark Knight movie?
@SaalBoat remember when we had weekly discussions about whether or not the dark knight rises was a shitty movie
Theres a animated DC movie called "The Dark Knight Returns Part 2." which I believe the Dawn of Justice movie is based on..
People who are looking forward to the movie should just check out the source material - The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller.
If this batman v superman movie is anything like the dark knight it's lit. Hope it ain't no kiddie movie.
The Dark Knight.... Still miles and miles away the best "superhero" movie to date across Marvel, DC, etc.

The Dark Knight Rises is funny in retrospect. The movie opens with Bruce being a recluse. Disinterested in being a hero any longer.

Gods damn, The Dark Knight is as amazing a movie as I remember it.
Watching The Dark Knight Rises. Not as good as BB or TDK (obviously) but still a damn good movie.
The ending of The Dark Knight Rises is the best ending to any movie ever. Too bad they aren't going to make another :(
(the dark knight & the dark knight rises) will forever be my favorite movie.

I really want WB animation team to do another DC comic movie of the same quality as their 2 part, The Dark Knight Returns movie.
THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is on and even though I don't love this movie, Tom Hardy's Bane voice is the best.
The Dark Knight rises is a fire movie
Watching the dark knight and holy fuck this movie is still so good!
Watching The Dark Knight Rises on TNT, love this movie. Wonder if TDK wasn't such a game-changer, this would still get the 'hate' it does?
and as I re watched it few days ago, I think Eastwood's "Gran Torino" is the best "movie adaptation" of The Dark Knight Returns so far
Gotta watch The Dark Knight Rises on TNT since my movie site got shut down. Smh.

Oh shit yeh, sorry. You've seen the movie adaptation of the dark knight saga as well. My bad.

Like THE DARK KNIGHT, Abrams show THE FORCE AWAKENS on 35mm and 65mm FILM. Meaning, it will shift in aspect ratios DURING the movie! YESSSS!
#StarWarsTheForceAwakens will stand with JURASSIC PARK, BATMAN and THE DARK KNIGHT as one of the best ever movie marketing campaigns!
I've only done a midnight showing once for the Dark Knight Rises and only because I went insane and bought tickets to the 3 movie marathon.

The Dark Knight was the first comic book movie to ever win an Oscar for achievement in acting (for Heath Ledger's performance).

The Dark Knight will forever be my fav movie
The Dark Knight will always be an emotional movie for me.
Soundtrack for THE DARK KNIGHT is one of those that works great with the film, but is a kinda crappy stand alone listen.
No superhero/comic based movie will ever be better than the Dark Knight. Way too good
The Dark Knight Rises was the first Batman movie created by Christopher Nolan that did not get an Academy Award nomination.
I can't go out for dinner tomorrow. They'll show The Dark Knight Rises. (It's absolutely not like I can watch the movie whenever I want )

I just found batman begins more entertaining. I can admit that all around the dark knight was a better made movie.
I got so much shit the first time I said batman begins was my fave Nolan batman movie. Like it was a crime for it not to be the dark knight
I recommend watching the dark knight rises for whoever wants to learn about persistence and strength. a true motivational session in a movie

I disliked the Dark Knight Rises the first time I saw it. Now I think it's the best superhero movie ever. Narrowly edging out Dark Knight.
The dark knight rises is the best movie and there is no denying it.
