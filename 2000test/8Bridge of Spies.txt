Best movie of the year. Bridge of Spies - Spielberg's masterpiece of the 1950s U2 incident. Mark Rylance and Tom Hanks. I can remember it.

Rocky IV is a better Cold War movie than Bridge of Spies and it isn't even a good example of Stallone's skill as a writer.

Bridge of Spies has inspired me to have a whiskey, like a grown up. Now waiting to see Carol. (the movie) (pumpkin/coco & whiskey works!)
Bridge of Spies is excellent. While a gentler (although suspenseful) movie than Schindler's List, it ends up as a strong companion piece.

Bridge of Spies was a great movie 10/10 would recommend.
had a cute evening with @simplyglox today.. the new Tom Hanks' movie, Bridge of Spies, is worth a watch.
Bridge of Spies isn't the sexiest spy movie, but it's certainly the most well-made. Terrific work by Hanks, Rylance, Kaminski, & Spielberg.

bridge of spies was a great movie
I watched Bridge of Spies tonight while at work at the theatre and wow it's an amazing movie. Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks. Watch it
Steven Spielberg is a masterful story teller. Finally got to see Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks & Mark Rylance. An old school "real" movie.
If Bridge of Spies is the peak Dad movie of the season, then Brooklyn is peak Mom. #filmcriticism
Bridge of Spies looks like potential movie of the year
Bridge of Spies is out next week for the UK at least. I'm totally going to review that movie, it looks fucking awesome.
What's the best movie in theaters right now??? Hunger games, Spectre, Bridge of Spies, or The Martian?
So, the Sneak Preview movie was Bridge of Spies http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3682448/?ref_=nv_sr_1 … It was pretty good!

I went to the movie theater and just got the next showing (Bridge of Spies) knowing nothing of the movie and it was actually really good.
So I can confirm that Bridge of Spies is not a movie about a bridge made out of spies, but spies atop of a bridge.
Bridge of Spies was good. Kind of enjoyed the story more than the movie, but everyone did a good job on the film.... http://fb.me/6XzGnIVaY 
The movie JACK STRONG-one of the most tightly shot Cold War spy movie, better than Bridge of Spies by Spielberg. BoS lacked screenplay.

Bridge of spies is pg13 but that new zombie movie is rated R... They both should be rated R
Both THE MARTIAN and STEVE JOBS have been among the best of the year, in a strong fall movie slate. Have to see BRIDGE OF SPIES still.
I highly recommend the movie Bridge of Spies. It was my first movie at theaters since Skyfall. Yep, it'd been a while.

Bridge of Spies was a spectacular movie. One of Tom Hanks best performances.
Bridge of Spies - "Standing Man" Tonight's movie. Thought provoking. http://youtu.be/Uw4wtObPv4k 
Movie tips 4 d week - The Martian, Matt Damon is great & Bridge of Spies, Tom Hanks. Suspenseful humerous & tension with great plots. Enjoy!

@heidimacp just saw him in Bridge of Spies. Excellent movie.
Bridge of Spies was the most perfectly photographed, scored, written, acted and directed movie I've seen in a long, long time.
Bridge of Spies was fantastic. Spielberg and Hanks doing what they do best: making movie magic. And it was written by the Coens too!
Weekend movie plans: Bridge of Spies, It Follows, The Phantom Menace, AND maayyybe Spectre. I feel like @MrPope and @CaseyMalone.
Bridge of Spies was pretty good. But it's always hard to watch a Tom Hanks movie that doesn't co-star Hooch.
The opening sequence of BRIDGE OF SPIES is among Spielberg's best work (and the rest of the movie is pretty good, too).
I liked a @YouTube video http://youtu.be/jXcEcPWIXlk?a  Bridge Of Spies movie review

Did get out of the house, went to see Bridge of Spies. Very good movie.
Watching Bridge of spies pretty good movie I give it 8 out of 10, man if you a spie, i guess you might as well die when you get caught
Bridge of Spies is a great movie. Also reinforced my hatred of any government agency similar to the CIA/FBI/NSA. So that made it even better
Tonight's movie: BRIDGE OF SPIES. I never miss a Tom Hanks-Mark Rylance movie.

I was pretty stoked to see @tomhanks's wife in Bridge of Spies cast age appropriately. That was pretty awesome. As was the whole movie.
Just watched Bridge Of Spies, and I loved it. Beautiful movie, informative. As it ended, a girl behind me said "cerita ni bosan la".
Bridge of spies is a brilliant movie!
Bridge of Spies is NOT an "old ppl" movie. My oldness informs me there are only "thoughtful ppl" movies and "stupid ppl" movies. So there.
Another movie recommendation: "Bridge of Spies." Can't go wrong with Hanks and Spielberg.
I'm watching the Bridge of Spies. The best thing about going to a movie?? The popcorn.

'Bridge of Spies' is an old-fashioned spy thriller movie but crafted with such excellent direction of a ridiculously good screenplay.

BRIDGE OF SPIES such a great and brilliant movie It's about spy, USA, Russian, Uni Soviet, Berlin … [pic] — https://path.com/p/3Eh3qu 
Bridge of Spies is not a movie about spy. It's about honesty, faith and loyalty. Danovan is awesome but that Russian man is everything.

Bridge of Spies is bartering on expert mode. Great movie if for anyone that cares about the politics of law.
Just saw Bridge of Spies. This Spielberg fella makes a pretty decent movie.
Just saw Bridge of Spies with my roommate. Definitely a great movie. Tom Hanks was phenomenal expect nothing less from a Spielberg film

I had the worst day at work today but treated myself to an alone time movie afterward. Bridge of Spies was phenomenal. Day = Improved

Saw the movie “BRIDGE OF SPIES” tonight. Highly recommend. ****/*****
Watched half of "bridge of spies" today but they had to stop it because the movie theatre had caught on fire. True story.
So Bridge of Spies was a thing. A very good thing. I’d been kind of secretly dreading sitting through a 2.5 hour movie about the Cold War…
Spielberg and Hanks' Bridge of Spies.Wow.Cold War spy movie? Check.Gorgeous cinematography? Check.Laughed AND cried? Check.Check.Check.
Bridge of Spies is a very good movie and I highly recommend that everyone sees it. It's a very good portrayal of a relatively unknown story
Dianne Curtis-Deardorff and I saw Bridge of Spies today. Terrific movie. http://fb.me/6QnIbs0MI 
That Spielberg can casually throw out a "minor" movie as good as BRIDGE OF SPIES is mind boggling.
Don't tell me Bridge of Spies is (yet another) male-only hero movie bc it's historical. Women didn't spring into life in the 21st century.
I guess it's dude movie day: THE MARTIAN, BRIDGE OF SPIES, an now OCEAN'S ELEVEN.
Took husband to see the new Spielberg movie, Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks for his birthday. Interesting movie.
And written by the Coen brothers. And apparently it's a really good movie. [Note to self: See BRIDGE OF SPIES]

Bridge of Spies may go down as Spielberg's most effortless and engaging movie of his career. A rare movie that feels like it ends too soon.
On a scale of 1 to Bridge of Spies, how much of an Oscar bait movie is Bridge of Spies? #BridgeOfSpies
Bridge of Spies is an excellent movie. I highly recommend it
Bridge of Spies was excellent! Go see this movie! Well done! Great story about the Cold War and our very own Gary Powers!
Bridge of Spies is a traditional movie made by a traditional filmmaker. Take that any way you like.
I can't wait to see Bridge of Spies this week. It's right in my area of interest. My check should go to movie tickets

Bridge Of Spies is another Spielberg classic. This movie just might win the Oscar for Best Picture. A 9 out of 10.
Just watched Bridge of Spies; It was a good movie, though predictable & action-less it kept me engaged throughout the drama.
Strange that many are saying Bridge of Spies is Spielberg's best movie since Saving Private Ryan. Did they see Catch Me if You Can?
Just seen Bridge of Spies. Excellent movie! Tom Hanks very good @20thcfoxnz
