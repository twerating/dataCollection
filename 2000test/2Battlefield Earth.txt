@inihelene @memoirsofgoldie what's your all time favorite movie besides battlefield earth movie?
@raitt75 Did it years ago when Battlefield Earth was out. Walked out after half an hour the movie was that bad.
When you realize that a gov't imposed tax system mandated by law is the true villain, Battlefield Earth becomes a much more enjoyable movie.
Interesting: inside story on the production of #BattlefieldEarth #movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDk8YvgNlw …
My favorite #StarWars movie was Battlefield Earth.
SURVEY: Name one movie from the past 20 years that should be skewered on @MST3K, *besides* Battlefield Earth.
Turns out the guy who designed the lightsaber (and, uh, directed Battlefield Earth) now lives in Toronto: http://bit.ly/1Z8CDlu 
@shanelongoria @azooklife no, everyone knows the worst movie of all time is battlefield earth. Or the dragon ball z live action movie.
Battlefield Earth RT @JuiceLeroy: Blue Lagoon! RT @CrushEgos: Frozen was the worst movie ever next to Bones w/ Snoop Dogg
@ruzkin If you let yourself think about this movie, its plotting is on par with Battlefield Earth.
but watch battlefield earth now that's a good bad movie seriously watch it it's so bad it's hilarious
Just realized if my life were a movie, it wouldn't even make it to the bottom of my Netflix queue. My life is worse than Battlefield Earth.
battlefield earth should've been a tyler perry movie
The @smosh movie is the worst film I've seen. And I've watched Battlefield Earth and the Room
@mybrainissmart Now you’re just getting petty. Battlefield Earth was a great movie.
What is with this trending #TheWizLive shit? The Wiz was a movie almost as shitty as Battlefield Earth and The Notebook. Fuck that.
4%. Man the critics really hated this movie. That's Battlefield Earth bad. I and too me Problem Child is a crass 80's movie.
Schindler's List and Battlefield Earth aren't similar. Am I not allowed to say Schindler's List is the better movie?
Battlefield Earth should have been a Tyler Perry movie
When you think about it, Weekend at Bernie's might be the wildest movie premise of all time. Way beyond Battlefield: Earth even.

"Battlefield Earth" (2000) is a terribly bad movie (F) #AhiMovieReviews <nyixsj>
@RAsnani True. One realises it after watching a movie based on their favourite book.The Bourne series & Battlefield Earth (judge me!) for me
@wilw I host MST3K panels... Word of advice... Don't turn it into a drinking game. Especially if the movie is Battlefield Earth.
@DailyDeadNews Not even 20 years now before we get a reboot of a movie. I can't wait for the reboot of Battlefield Earth..said no one ever
@ashleylynch this is weird but Battlefield Earth washed everything in purple for the whole movie + it made the scenes with no filter jarring
Found the book for 'Battlefield Earth', wonder if it's just as bad as the movie.
Challenge of the day - name a movie worse than Battlefield Earth
When you look like a movie and sound like a song but the movie is Battlefield Earth and the song is Agadoo.

I proceeded to inform this person that Battlefield Earth, Pixels, and Movie 43 are things that exist, and are far worse than the prequels.
@JohnTravolta__ if Battlefield Earth hadn't been a movie, and it shouldn't have been, "The Room" would be the Battlefield Earth of movies.
@politico @TheLeadCNN @maddow the GOTP playbook seems to be scripted by movie BATTLEFIELD EARTH.unreal
@MWhitbourn was he considered for Battlefield Earth? Because Travolta was arguably more perfect for the worst movie ever.
Watching Battlefield Earth was not one of my better late movie viewings. John Travolta should never wear dreadlocks.
@clydeleesmith I'm very proud of the passage in my THE REPLACEMENTS review where I say BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a better football movie.
The [Final Fantasy] movie was the biggest flop since Battlefield Earth.

@EricStallsworth @imgur I enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The movie was dreadful. Rama as a movie would be stunning...if they get it right.
@EllieMGarratt @imgur true, Rama is a good choice. One I liked a bunch was Battlefield Earth. The movie was forgettable but not the book.
I sure hope the movie is a hit. I took a bath in all those Battlefield Earth toys. #ForceFriday

Battlefield earth should have been a Tyler perry movie...
@OrvilleIV Battlefield Earth you're a wonderful, wonderful movie.
On a scale of Battlefield Earth to Wrath of Khan, #JupiterAscending is whatever M Night's next movie is.
when i here someone say that was a bad movie i have to ask is it the room bad or battlefield earth bad
Oh, btw, Battlefield Earth was quite possibly the most embarrassing thing to ever come from Scientology. Worst movie of all time.
Transformers: Marky Mark edition is the biggest piece of shit movie I've ever watched & I've seen the first 20 minutes of Battlefield Earth
"'Battlefield: Earth' should have been a Tyler Perry movie!" -Black Scientologist

I think the singer for Korn did a good job in the movie Battlefield Earth. pic.twitter.com/vgtJiR0dyr
@amisij hehehe. Read Battlefield Earth. A tad racist but if you can take it, is not too bad. It was made into a movie. Yuck.
@william_pitts I think he was referring to Battlefield: Earth being made into a lousy movie.
for reference: Battlefield Earth, The Master of Disguise, Jack & Jill, Movie 43, Catwoman, The Last Airbender all have better RT statistics
Battlefield Earth is probably the worst movie ever created
Battlefield Earth. It'd be the only movie he can't make any freakin' worse. #sorrynotsorry #AddBlartImproveAMovie
Holy crap. The director of that Christian Slater movie Stranded that was really bad was the director of Battlefield Earth.

@TheSpoonyOne and actually, I think Stilt-Man was featured in a movie before: Battlefield Earth.
The response from my Battlefield Earth discussion is that nobody likes the movie but everyone has read the 1000 page book? How? I'm baffled.
There is a robbing Fort Knox in the year 3000 scene in Battlefield Earth. How do people seriously not like this movie?!?

John Travolta is defending Scientology. He's also still defending his movie "Battlefield Earth"…so take that for what you will.
Blair Witch Project will go down as the worst movie ever shot in my book, even worse than Battlefield Earth.
@PLeahy97 @RefCoryPrice battlefield earth what a piece of steaming Shit. That movie is a cinematic abortion

@juliacunningham @mariosity Travolta is all like, "Going Clear? Go watch a real movie like Battlefield Earth!"
Had to watch Battlefield Earth for the "It's The Worst Movie Club". Travolta, you may have ruined Grease for me. #Leverage
@JulesRPG @JohnnyFeisty I would rather watch hours of Barney (shudder) than Battlefield Earth (the only movie I've ever walked out on). O.o
@FO_ScottKacsmar Only movie I’ve fallen asleep during was Battlefield Earth. Though that owed more to terribleness and lack of sleep.

"Battlefield Earth, a film based on a book by L. Ron Hubbard" lawl that movie looks so awful I can't even try to watch it
@SweatpantsCafe Battlefield Earth! I loved that book way back when. The movie ruined it for me when it came out.
also, don't watch battlefield earth, its a terrible movie
@Brent_Kong we'll go get audited and say Battlefield Earth is our favorite movie
Ok, forget Scientology for a moment. I actually thought the book, 'Battlefield Earth', was a good read. Movie, no. Book, yes.

@drockalexander have you seen Battlefield Earth? It is a hilariously terrible movie, but it's based on Scientology beliefs.
Scientology movie marathon: First "Going Clear" then "The Master" and finish it with "Battlefield Earth"
@sunzdevil WTF was that movie Travolta did about the science fiction book L. Ron wrote? Like Battlefield Earth? never saw but he looked cray
Battlefield Earth is that movie where the more you know about the technique and finesse of film-making, the more painful it is to watch
Wonder if the Smith family lost favor with Scientology after Will's nearly-worse-than-Battlefield-Earth Scientology movie tanked?

Fact: I paid to see Battlefield Earth in the movie theater. I adore John Travolta too much. #GoingClear
Even more baffling is why I agreed to see Battlefield Earth in theaters. That movie may actually be as bad as DragonBall Evolution.
So, just finally watched Draft Day... It officially passed Battlefield Earth as the worst movie I've ever watched...

@FreedomEthics Who is the scientologist film crtic who has seen the movie? I'll just look for the lone good review of Battlefield Earth.

John Travolta has to be Battlefield Earth! Awful movie! #pointless
Battlefield Earth should've been a Tyler Perry movie
The Awful movie Trifecta of Battlefield Earth, Silent Night Deadly Night 2 and The Room is complete. Truly awful films. Hilarious though.
Don't go see that trashfest #GoingClear! Instead see a good movie: Battlefield Earth. Happy Birthday, LRH!! #Scientology #LRonHubbard
@FreedomEthics @alexgibneyfilm This movie's a stinker alright! Go see Battlefield Earth if you are hungry for good cinema.

@Tyrant_Husky >__> we shall never speak of that movie that's the Battlefield Earth for birds.
Just imagine trying to pitch a science fiction movie after Battlefield Earth premiered.
Based on trailer, the new Divergent movie looks historically bad. We're approaching Batman & Robin, Battlefield Earth territory I think.
Favorite movie? Battlefield Earth. #OffendEveryoneIn4Words

@ppgarcia75 hello PP, si tu ne connais pas "Battlefield Earth" je te le conseille...en tant que pizza movie bien sûr ;)
@TheOnlyCleoLuna I'd agree if I hadn't sat thru T4, Movie 43 or Battlefield Earth. At least B&R had Schwarzenegger, no matter how awful...
His face though! He needs to STOP! Face-Off the lifetime movie RT @juanitaw: *nods* And I used to like him. Then Battlefield Earth happened
@EugeneCho I agree!! I saw Battlefield Earth 15 years ago, and it has been at the VERY top of my all-time worst movie list ever since!

Jupiter Ascending. Fifth Element. Battlefield Earth. Mighty Morphin Power Ranger the Movie. A list of Camp Space Opera, any suggestions?

@portraitinflesh @mallelis @ryanruppe We discussed Scientology and Battlefield Earth during the movie, in fact
Girls? Guys? Why does the movie Aquaman look like a rejected extra from Battlefield Earth? How did we get to this point?
That's right, our tent pole movie for next summer will be Battlefield Earth 2 - about $200 mill should do it. #HowIWouldQuit @midnight
Jupiter Ascending is a good science fiction movie, but only if your yardstick is Battlefield Earth.

@thatwallacewit Battlefield Earth? That was the one with Travolta or an i thinking about something else? That movie was below average for me
@Suzapalooz Battlefield Earth w/a sappy love story? Probs my bro's new fave movie . Haha
If any Sci-fi movie gets bad reviews from "movie critics", it's probably telling you truth about human origins. I.e. Battlefield Earth
@kharyrandolph @UPROXX battlefield earth was terrible but somehow it makes a great movie to draw to, so perhaps this. . .
I still say Battlefield Earth was the worst sci-fi movie of all time.
What movie will be worse Battlefield Earth or Jupiter Ascending?
@Nikeyg1 @RogueCreed Apparently the movie is like Battlefield Earth without the Scientology excuse
@wbpictures this movie looks like Battlefield Earth
@padresj Battlefield Earth was easily the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen some bad ones.

@mattzollerseitz that movie looks Battlefield Earth bad
What movie are the people on #liveline talking about? Is it Battlefield Earth it? It's not a great film, to be honest.
@Pj24742 @ACatNamedMo It's definitely not Ishtar. It's a good movie. Battlefield Earth is the Ishtar of Sci-Fi.

@CrusherJ The trailers I've seen haven't reminded me of Battlefield Earth, but then I've tried to forget that movie. ^_^;
I think it's funny that The Church of Scientology and Battlefield Earth (aka the worst movie of all time) were created by the same guy.
#AmericanSniper is the worst fudging movie I've ever saw in my life and I've seen battlefield earth.
In Battlefield Earth the movie was supposedly an attack on Asians that kept slaves. Often they took low paying jobs and served them.
We saw Battlefield Earth because my family would see almost any new sci fi movie in the mid 90s.
The worst movie is probably Battlefield Earth. The most disappointing probably Miranda July’s The Future. That movie was traumatic.
Superman 3 could be the worst movie I've ever seen, except of course battlefield earth
@JamesMitchell4R And really, the true worst movie I've ever seen was Battlefield Earth.

Battlefield Earth should have been a @tylerperry movie!
@LianaBrooks It doesn't seem like a book has to be good to be made into a movie. Eragon, 50SG, Battlefield Earth, etc.
@colejhenry @OuijaTheMovie @Chris_Stuckmann I'm sorry Cole but I have to say my favorite movie is Battlefield Earth. Truly Travolta's best

@TheStuckFlick Battlefield Earth #Hilariocity and I never dared to watch the movie ,he did it for me.
@James_v_S Quite. Now the Battlefield Earth movie, OTOH, is hilariously bad. Even the Level 2 Thetans thought it was bad.
While too long & written by a complete nutjob/charlatan, Battlefield Earth was a pretty fun read. The movie sucked donkey ass though.

The Scariest movie I’ve ever seen was Battlefield Earth.

"@weakSquare: "Left Behind" is currently faring WORSE by critics than "Battlefield Earth" widely regarded as worst movie of all time." YAY!
@UnknownKadath Battlefield Earth is a good example; just because they tilt the camera all the time doesn't make the movie any better
A movie based on Tetris makes about as much sense as a game based on Battlefield Earth
As someone who's seen Battlefield:Earth, twice, I know what a terrible movie is.

This movie is weird to say the least..."Battlefield Earth"
I must really hate myself today, because I'm watching Battlefield Earth. This is truly a special kind of bad movie.

In our new "best worst movie" club, Battlefield Earth has already won me over with a nice central wipe transition cut.
@mirtle @MikeCormack Demolition Man is a "so bad it's good" type of movie. Battlefield Earth is a guilty pleasure of mine. #confessionbear
has john travolta done a worse movie than 'battlefield earth'?
Battlefield Earth is the strangest movie I've ever watched.
Battlefield Earth & 3000 Miles to Graceland are my top 2. Neither deserves to exist. RT @Kevin_E_Park: What's your worst movie of all time?
Battlefield Earth is my favorite movie. John Travolta is amazing.
"my favourite movie is battlefield earth"
In hell,there's only going to be two movies-"Battlefield Earth" and that One Direction movie.
RT“ @FinancialTimes: Steve Jobs’ genius isn’t movie material". Nor was L Ron Hubbard but sadly that didn't prevent Battlefield Earth
Battlefield Earth was made for roughly $44 million. I would like to see SyFy make a worse movie with that much money.
I guess I have been sitting here watching Battlefield Earth. Worse than #GhostShark because this movie had a big budget.
@chasmurf Maybe Battlefield Earth is his favorite movie?
Watching Battlefield Earth. I just noticed that you're watching the movie lopsided the whole time. This would scarevne if I were drunk
BATTLEFIELD EARTH Is on. Why is this entire movie shot diagonally?
battlefield earth sucks dick I needa new movie to watch
I'm gunna watch this movie called Battlefield Earth that I haven't watched in like forever
Mortal Instruments was actually the worst movie I have ever seen, even worse than Battlefield Earth.
Battlefield Earth is such a tight movie.

In the movie Battlefield Earth an alien race finds the voyager probe and are interested in Earth because gold is extremely rare and valuable
Battlefield earth - the book - awesome. Battlefield earth - the movie- awful.
Action August Day 19! Gold is awesome! The worst movie ever? Battlefield Earth reviewed on #BasementRejects http://basementrejects.com/review/battlefield-earth-2000/ …
So late to the party(13 years!) butjust watched Battlefield Earth. An absolute abortion of a movie.
@therealcliffyb probably the dumbest sci fi movie since battlefield earth. Still an entertaining couple of hours visually though.
Friend: "Describe a relationship you had with your ex using a movie title" Me: "Battlefield Earth"
Just watched The Nostalgia Critic's Battlefield Earth review. Inspired look at what NYT called "possibly the worst movie of this century."
@spillly @melshaw001 well for starters with that list, like wikipedia I can add a movie like battlefield earth to great movie.
@jsnell @PhilipMichaels @monty_ashley @dloehr @dmoren 'Battlefield Earth' was the worse movie I ever paid to watch in a theater.
Heard Battlefield Earth was a great book. While watching the movie, looked it up on @IMDb and saw worst rated movie ever! 2.4 #movies
A built in movie theater playing Battlefield Earth 24/7 #TomCruisecruise
@MeeshDrawsGood I've never walked out of a movie. We just end up riffing it if it starts getting bad. Battlefield Earth was fun. XD
@a_belso @kimscorcher Worst movie I have seen was called Elephant. It was about a school shooting. Makes Battlefield Earth look amazing.
@twitney what if... That movie is actually a Scientology allegory like Battlefield Earth. They baby is Xenu
Watching Battlefield Earth again. I used to think this movie was just bad. I now realize it is fantastically bad. No wonder Scientology.
@stalinfan69 @tomvds @fethersss This movie called Battlefield Earth, man, it's crazy. We're gonna be slaves and everything will be tilted.
@LAIreland I am a long time Scientologist. Battlefield Earth - GREAT book! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MOVIE. HORRIBLE! Not Scientology propoganda
I love this Battlefield Earth movie review: http://www.rinkworks.com/badmovie/reader/408.shtml … #battlefieldearth
Battlefield Earth was more than a little awesome, both as a novel, and as a movie. #confessyourunpopularopinion
My dad took me to Battlefield Earth when it was in theaters. We didn’t really know about scientology, we thought it would be a fun movie.
#ifiwonthepowerball I'd make a movie of Battlefield Earth the right way. John Travolta and Olivia Newton John
@DannyLeeWynter I also forgot Battlefield Earth aka Scientology is Awesome: the Movie.
@LightDonnaclus That sounds like the plot for that crappy Battlefield Earth movie. Which I watched in 240p on YouTUbe out of boredom.
And one man bad movie night comes to a close. Battlefield Earth is still impossibly bad, but ahead of its time. SyFy has finally reached it.
"I'd rather watch Battlefield Earth" ........... EXCUSE YOU DID WE EVEN SEE THE SAME MOVIE??? PACIFIC RIM WAS SHEER GENIUS OKAY
Battlefield Earth is a good movie except for the acting, writing, casting, directing, and editing.
@martinshine And that 'Battlefield Earth' movie vanity project by John Travolta. @ijsbignose @lbc973 @ollymann
Movie time: Cloudy with a chance of meatballs: 3.8/5.0 Battlefield Earth: 3.7/5.0 Chronicles of Riddick: 3.9/5.0 John Carter: 4.0/5.0.
It's not the greatest scifi movie but it's definitely not worse than battlefield earth as somebody said recently, that is for friggin sure.
The mind blowing thing about Battlefield Earth is not the plot, it's the amount of talented people who are taking the whole movie seriously.
Watching Battlefield Earth. Never watched it. Since everyone uses it as a barometer for worst movie comparisons, figured I should see it.
I'm watching this super cheesy sci fi movie called battlefield earth with john travolta and I just... I can't

The Omega Code was a better movie than The Devil's Arithmetic. Battlefield Earth was, too (but close). God's Army was worse, though.
Battlefield Earth was a better movie than #Sharknado
@Keith_Martin2 No no. Battlefield Earth was trying to be a serious movie.
equal to battlefield earth RT @realfreemancbs: Worst movie ever made, correct?
Yes. RT @CrankyTRex: @EdMorrissey This movie is like Battlefield: Earth would be if Battlefield: Earth wasn't trying to be a serious movie.
Battlefield Earth is such a horribly, shitty movie.

@LuckyLeilani @Shoq I heard it was worse than Battlefield Earth. Each movie of his gets an even lower rating at imdb. That's a hard feat
Try to think of the most painful movie you've ever watched. For me, it's a toss up between Battlefield Earth and Texas Nailgun Massacre.
@MykeAWESOME_ you have all missed it the worst movie is Battlefield Earth that Scientology crap that John Travolta was in, unbelievably bad
I think I lost a dozen IQ points watching Battlefield Earth. That was a truly terrible movie.
Battlefield Earth looks like a bad made-for-TV movie. Hard to believe the director was an art director for Alien. Must of bad a lobotomy.
@bradfo battlefield earth is the worst movie ever made
Watched Battlefield Earth. In it's entirety. Why do the Psychlo's speak English when it's just them talking? Also, why was this movie made?
Until today, "Battlefield Earth"'s atrocities were merely hearsay. Confirmed. "Yeast Lords" (Gentlemen Broncos) was a better sci-fi movie.

And for your inflight movie we present... Battlefield Earth.

From now on before I watch a movie I've never seen,I'm gonna watch Gigli or Battlefield Earth first. Then the new movie will seem great.
@lilduval its an Attempt to get people to join Scientology.John Travolta tried it with Battlefield Earth. It was called the worst movie ever

Is After Earth the worst movie ever made? There's always Battlefield Earth - from Washington Post review
Is it just me, or is Will Smith's new movie giving off Battlefield Earth levels of bad? It could easily be Battlefield Earth 2.
Wow...Battlefield Earth is a terrible movie
Battlefield Earth was a great movie until a psych electoshocked the film editors & screenwriters. http://owl.li/lI6nY  #Scientology
Hmm. Another Scientology-theme movie bites the big one! Will Smith's "After Earth" bombs at box office. But not as bad as Battlefield Earth!
@Roninfish Now every sc-fi movie with scientologists in it is called propoganda.The only clear example of that is Battlefield Earth.
"Is After Earth the worst movie ever made? Maybe not; there's always Battlefield Earth to remind us how low the bar can go" Joe Morgenstern.

Watching battlefield earth on cinimax good movie
Will Smith and John Travolta are doubling down on their sci-fi movie careers by agreeing to star in and produce After Battlefield Earth.
Ok i lied The One w/ Jet Li is the worst movie i have ever saw besides Battlefield Earth.
dammit, "after earth" was going to be the title of my documentary about people traumatized by the movie battlefield earth
Battlefield Earth was the worst movie I ever seen. I was mad after I seen that movie...
Is "After Earth" a Scientology propaganda movie a la "Battlefield Earth"? And is it as much of a turkey? http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/a-scientologist-reviews-earth-guest-561310 …
So, is Will Smith's After Earth movie his John Travolta's Battlefield Earth?
#confession I love the movie Battlefield Earth
Which movie is better - Battlefield Earth or After Earth? Huffpo answer...they both suck.
I just did a beer-sipping spit-take, home alone, to myself, when I saw a picture of Forrest Whitaker from the movie 'Battlefield Earth.'
@nwahs086 @AndreaKcc Battlefield Earth is the best bad movie ever. It's so bad that it's an art in itself
I guess it's true. W. Smith caught the Scientology bug from Travolta and produced the second worse movie since Battlefield Earth. #afterearth
@GodivAndCream @SMichaelRay @EW I read online that it was another undercover #Scientology movie ala Battlefield Earth
@neontaster After earth should be renamed Battlefield Earth 2. The whole movie is scientology propoganda.
Which movie is worse? Battlefield Earth or My Giant.... I can't believe I saw both in theaters!
@kiva_jane BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a helluva movie.
If you think the Battlefield Earth is the worst sci-fi movie ever, you've barely scratched the surface... they get a LOT worse.
@noobde I've been told AE might overtake Battlefield Earth as worst Hollywood Sci-Fi movie of all time. I'm seeing it just for that reason.
People are calling "After Earth" the worst movie since "Battlefield Earth". That's an impressive feat Mr. Shyamalan has accomplished there.
Marmol's so bad, if he were a movie, he'd be "Battlefield Earth".
http://everythingnabi.blogspot.com/2012/10/how-do-i-install-netflix-on-nabi-2.html … "How do I install NetFlix on the Nabi"? You don't!!! What if the kids see "Hillary the Movie" or "Battlefield Earth"?

Battlefield Earth is a great movie guys
@EdwardStGrey23 Whoever was reviewing that new Will/Jaden Smith movie compared it to Battlefield Earth. @MelserWBAL was on broadcast. Lol
@PamelaDayM ex-Scientologist reviewer says thx to "After Earth," "Battlefield Earth" is now the 2nd worst movie, ever.
@ScifiCommons me, too. I worry this movie will be awful - similar to Travolta's Battlefield Earth. Self indulgent crap.
Also, did not know that the movie Battlefield Earth was meant to be an actual introduction to Scientology for the people who saw it.
I couldnt sleep and, w/lack of sleep, poor decisions followed. I actually watched the movie Battlefield Earth in it entirety. #SelfPunishing
Hmm. Reviews for the latest M. Night Shamalama-ding-dong movie "After Earth" are saying it's as bad as "Battlefield Earth". BIG shock there.
After Earth might be the funniest & stupidest movie since Battlefield Earth. m night shyamalan might have become Hollywood's worst director
Looks like After Earth is becoming the next Battlefield Earth. I know what movie to avoid this summer. Goodbye too Will Smith BO power.

@GregHNZ did you see the link I just posted about how it's a scientology movie? Shades of Battlefield Earth, but it can't be THAT good.
After Earth is getting the worst reviews I've seen since Battlefield Earth. I wouldn't recommend making Sc-Fi movie with Earth in the title
@DamonBruce Worst movie you've ever seen? Does Batman Forever and/or Battlefield Earth make the list? #2TheTweets
Will Smith’s BATTLEFIELD EARTH Said to be Worst Movie Ever Made… Oh, Wait… http://dlvr.it/3S5Kxq 
@talpostal Wow...certainly puts the movie in a different light, doesn't it? Well at least this propaganda's better than Battlefield Earth...
@petersuderman "After Earth", the worst movie ever made? Not while a negative of "Battlefield Earth" exists.
Battlefield Earth was the worst movie I've ever seen. Seems like Scientology + film is a bad combo... #AfterEarth http://www.showbiz411.com/2013/05/31/will-smith-movie-after-earth-being-called-out-by-critics-for-scientology-references …
@PaulCharchian battlefield earth was pretty bad. Father in law took me to that movie, our relationship has only gotten worse
@amuredda exactly! I wish it Scientology indoctrination movie! That'd be something fun to be excited for and love. Battlefield Earth > A.E.
#AfterEarth Guaranteed to be the "Ishtar" of Sci-Fi Movies. Not since "Battlefield Earth" was there a Sci-Fi Movie meant 2B straight-2-DVD
Only 14% positive reviews for Will Smith's Scientology movie #AfterEarth. They should have called it After Battlefield Earth.
. @wsj - Is "After Earth" the worst movie ever made? Maybe not; there's always "Battlefield Earth" to remind us how low the bar can go.
@scottdagostino you mean they actually made another post-apocalyptic movie starring a Scientologist after Battlefield Earth?
After Earth being a Scientology movie would be interesting. If Battlefield Earth didn't exist.
WSJ review of "After Earth"... Basically it's "Battlefield Earth 2". Read it is you like biting movie reviews. http://on.wsj.com/11eT5UO 
Joe Morgenstern: Is "After Earth" the worst movie ever made? Maybe not; there's always "Battlefield Earth". Doh! http://on.wsj.com/11eT5UO 
@WashBizNeibs @kegleblanc True story: If Battlefield Earth is on TV, I'm drawn to it like moth to a flame. It's an awesomely atrocious movie
@perrynoble Battlefield Earth, Just ask @PastorMark he's the movie critic!
@snarktrooper hey I see this movie being almost as big as Battlefield Earth!!!
“ @thetrunkdr: @CHEZ106Eric After Earth a Scientology movie http://rorr.im/reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f8gef/ …” I sort of suspected that! Will Smith's Battlefield Earth!
After Earth being compared to Battlefield Earth aka worst movie of all time lmaoooooo
@misterpatches FWIW, I did have strange, though brief, Battlefield Earth flashbacks while watching this movie
Would you rather watch Battlefield Earth or Scary Movie 3,4,5?
@andylevy Happy to see a terrible movie like Battlefield Earth in your top 5. Why not The Room?

#confessionnight Battlefield earth was a good 80s movie.
@TomMilkowitz I Weep for "Battlefield Earth" if Only because the Book was So Great, and the Movie Fell Flat. Very Sad.
I know a flop movie when I see one. After Earth I am talking to you. This is Battlefield Earth all over again word to John Travolta.
I'm just saying, if Red Barchetta was a movie, it would be up there with Battlefield Earth. As a song though, AWESOME.

@srb846 Wait, there's a movie called Starship Troopers Armageddon? Wow. That's got to be almost as bad as Battlefield Earth Face/Off.
Also the ending bites the ending of BATTLEFIELD EARTH. This isn't a spoiler because none of you have seen that movie all the way through.
This movie already has more Dutch angles than Thor, Battlefield Earth, and The Third Man combined. #airbud

The worst sci-fi movie ever made (Battlefield Earth) is now on Youtube, in full length: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFAMfvXOJaU … So bad it's .. still bad.
Even without audio "One Day" is the worst movie I have ever half watched. I wonder if SkyGo has Battlefield Earth?
The worst movie I've ever seen = Battlefield Earth.
So we are all in agreement. Battlefield Earth is John Travolta's best movie
@iMiiiike It's a 3/5 movie. Not good but not bad. Now Battlefield Earth.....yeah, that is so bad it's worth watching to make fun of.
@KippLAdams There is no crying in space. Unless you try watching Battlefield Earth on the ISS movie night.
@IcarusTyler Sure, its a lame movie. But I actually enjoyed Battlefield Earth when I first saw it. Should I not admit that?

For those who are wondering what 'Battlefield Earth' is - it's been repeatedly called the worst science fiction movie of ALL TIME.
"It's not often -- not ever, in fact -- that a movie will put you in mind of Battlefield Earth." #TheHostReviews
@AceofSpadesHQ Yep, the youth are all about Dutch angles. That's why Battlefield Earth was such a blockbuster - the whole movie used that!

@jawaddell Weird visual imagery gets me every time. When that Travolta movie "Battlefield Earth" came out, I had nightmares for weeks!

Even John Travolta's movie abomination "Battlefield Earth" had fans i guess. #Community

Comparing #hungergames to Twilight b/c both are YA is like comparing every new scifi movie to Battlefield Earth. Of COURSE it's better.

I hope that every copy of the hunger games that gets sent to movie theaters was replaced with "Battlefield Earth" Everyone would be so angry
