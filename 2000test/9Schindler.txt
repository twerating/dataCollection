#BajrangiBhaijan is really a good movie. Loved it !! It reminded me of Academy Award winning Schindler's List.
Everytime I watch Schindler's list or any movie involving the holocaust I get so sad
@humanbeanjuice9 c) It was a great movie, but it's comedy. We aren't talking about Schindler's List getting remade using Presbyterians

It's uncommon for me to buy a movie on Blu-Ray that I already own on DVD, but I must say that the transfer of Schindler's List is fantastic.

Schindler's List was very well directed movie. I used to watch it with my mom all the time. Such a sad story of course...
Jerry Seinfeld was in the movie theater making out & getting sticky fingers during Schindler's List. GOAT.
Watching the movie Schindler's List. It's powerful.
Just because a movie isnt The Godfather doesnt mean you cant enjoy it you dont watch Zoolander like "This aint schindler's list" shut up
one way to explain who i am to others is telling them that one time i described schindler's list as a feel-good movie to another human.
Probably the best movie mankind ever made ! — watching Schindler's List
MOVIE IDEA: Liam Neeson returns as a young Oskar Schindler and overcomes his childhood speech impediment. Coming in 2016...Schindler's Lisp
#Jews Schindler's list was a book of fiction Spielberg's movie based on fiction made it non-fiction It was real in #Jewish psychotic minds
Finally managed to watch Schindler's List. It made me cry. First movie to do that.

What is your favorite black and white movie? — Schindler's List http://ask.fm/a/c48i8q6i 
wait so Liam Neeson WAS Oskar Schindler in the Schindler's list movie? woah I knew it looked like him
Liam Neeson is in another typical generic action movie. I miss his Schindler's List era.
Wow Schindler's List is an amazing movie
@IGoKu_YT I think you'd enjoy Schindler's List. It's a fantastic movie
Son went from Schindler's List to fighting drug cartels and crime lords and wild wolves every movie. He's tired!
Schindler's List was an amazing movie, but so incredibly sad. The utmost respect for Oskar Schindler. He saved 1200 Jews during WWII.
Finished watching Schindler's List Great movie You should all watch it Now I'm very very sad

Watching "Schindler's List" for the 1st time, trying to figure out the classic/absolute trash movie ratio for Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley.
It's been a long time since I cried, so I want to watch a sad movie. Just not The Green Mile or Schindler's List. Those way are too much.
On this day in 1997, Schindler's List is the first movie televised completely without commercial interruption. http://ow.ly/2V3LP4 
Watching Schindler's list and enjoying the movie it is really interesting
In honor of the Oscars, a throwback to the beautiful music from the 1994 Oscar winning movie, Schindler's List. http://youtu.be/-vJwgpX2T0g 
honestly silence of the lambs is the only one id watch again for pleasure and schindler's list is a worthy if flawed movie but oof ugh argh.
American Sniper is the most impacting movie you've seen? What about Schindler's List...Sophie's Choice...even The Passion? Jeez people.
A movie named "Birdman" just won Best Picture. "Lawrence of Arabia." "Schindler's List." And now.."Birdman."
1993 Schindler's List won best picture. So a movie about slaughtering Innocent people (jews) makes sense. #OverreactingOverTheOscars
I think I figured out why they played the Schindler's list theme for Liam Neeson...it's his Oscar movie.
I'll never understand Liam Neeson's movie choices... The guy was in Schindler's List
@rgay If he made a movie called Schindler's List now, I imagine it would involve a list of people to kill.
I still wonder how Liam Neeson goes from playing Oscar nominee Oscar Schindler to action movie whore... he's doing the career opposite
My game is picking out what movie score is accompanying each announcer. Liam Neeson = Schindler's List.
First movie on my list- Schindler's list. Now watching
Liam Neeson do another movie like Schindler's List please
@heykarlin I believe his next movie will be "Schindler's Fist."
@singingboy12 no hate. Really good movie, deserves Oscar nom but wasn't Schindler's List.
Schindler's List is a heartbreaking movie
'95, that is, '94 was when Schindler's List BTFO of every other movie & I started getting hooked on this whole movie thing.
