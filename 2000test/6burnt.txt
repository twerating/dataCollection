If they don't refer to apocalypse as a-POKO-lypse in this new x-men movie, I'm gonna be burnt, because that's my childhood right there.
I am intrigued by the new #XMenApocalypse movie but to be honest, I'm burnt out and have a very rabid disdain for Singer's "interpretation"
@slashfilm @devincf I think a Boba Fett movie would be cool if it was less of a western and more Burnt By The Sun in space.
Think I might just visit Shaz at work today and catch "Burnt" the movie.. Been waiting to watch it
Considering all the masterchefs and kitchen nightmares I have seen, I should probably watch that Burnt movie huh.

Just watched 'Burnt', good movie. I'm just a bit disappointed that nothing got burnt. Spoiler alert**
'Burnt' Movie-I had such hopes for it.Sad to say full of idle writing from the late 1980s.Cast did well with a half-baked storyline 4/10.

@JoshMacuga about your box office predictions on collider i don't think burnt will be making the top 5 (nobody cares about that movie)
After seeing the movie 'burnt' tonight, good movie about a chef btw, feel less excited about the 2 day old pizza awaiting me at the house
You know Burnt isn't going to be the most original movie in the world when the great French father figure chef is named "Jean Luc."
"People eat because they're hungry. I want to make food that makes them stop eating" - #Burnt Brilliant movie, highly recommended.
#Burnt was a great movie
@JeffnjkJeff @2Hopesdestiny You's gotta have good popcorn to watch a movie. Burnt popcorn is total crap!!! Can't eat that shit.
"Chris, I hear you're in town! Let's meet up and catch up" It's that easy guys. Please don't leave me with a mediocre movie and burnt pizza"
I saw the movie BURNT tonight, it was decent. Bradley Cooper was very good in it, but it was kinda all over the place. 3/5 stars. #Burnt

The movie I saw was Burnt & it was pretty good. I heard a piece of Donnie Darko music in one scene & I was like wha?
Burnt: You go see this movie because Cooper has pretty eyes and a nice jawline and wears tshirts really well and has a nice bum and can cry.
Burnt, the movie is "undercooked". cinema was full of girls because of Bradley Cooper
I'm watching a scary movie and the couple literally just had sex in the kitchen, forgetting that they were cooking and burnt breakfast.

"Burnt" is not a good name for a food movie. It would be a lot better if it was called "omg this food taste very deliciously good"
I probably shouldn't see this 'Burnt' movie. I've been thinking of dropping this law thing for the culinary arts and that my send me over
A chef movie called "Burnt" is like a doctor movie called "Accidentally Left a Sponge in the Patient."
That movie burnt looks awful. Make another hang over dumbass

@msilangil91 'Chef' is about Jon Favreau getting his buddies to make a delicious movie. 'Burnt' is a feel good spinoff to 'Whiplash.'
So...how are 'Burnt' and 'Chef' not the same movie?

Spoiler alert - in the movie Burnt, Bradley Cooper's cooking style is "out of date". I don't want to give away too much.

Imagine if they changed the B to a T in the movie 'burnt' that'd be something else
The movie Burnt makes me want to be a chef
I feel like I only room in my life for one cooking themed movie, and I already saw Chef, so it's a hard pass on Burnt.

@GordonRamsay @grahamelliot will you guys watch the movie Burnt with Bradley Cooper? If a movie was made about you, who would portray you?
"Burnt" - worst movie title ever. Would only be cool as sequel to half baked

I don't understand why Hollywood thinks the world needs "Burnt." If I want to watch a movie about cooking I'll watch "Ratatouille."
there was talk of adding Tina Fey to cast of Bradley Cooper's new movie 'Burnt' and changing title to 'Ya Burnt!' but it didn't 'pan' out!
