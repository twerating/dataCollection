Batman Forever: Terrible movie, fantastic soundtrack.
Mortal Kombat, a bad comic book movie and Streets of Rage had an orgy. This is what came out of it.... http://youtu.be/jkBKpOcjoSk?a 
@SuperBroMovies in all honesty though, Batman Forever was worse, this wasn't the "worst" movie ever in my opinion

@summerdoan I love Batman too even Clooney for that matter but there were a lot of screw ups in that movie. Now Batman Forever >>>>

A 90s KID went to see A Goofy Movie at the theatre and they show previews for Batman Forever and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie....
The Acting of @JimCarrey in the movie batman forever blows my mind. Like WOW!
Watching Batman Forever. This movie is so good, how did they let B&R become such a dumpster fire? Killed a great franchise.
OHHHHH SHIT!!! Batman Forever the best Batman movie ever is on in 10 minutes!!!
@JeremyJahns yes, I thought it was mediocre at best, Lex looks like riddler from batman:forever and they basically showed a 3-minute movie
@GeekWilliam Lex looked like Jim Carrey as the Riddler in Batman Forever. This movie looks like a repeat of that.

@DMC_Ryan Last Batman movie I saw was Batman Forever. Superhero flicks aren't my thing. But people hating on it already is silly.
@darthtardis @timdrake_3 @DanSlott @ZerobardThawne @ArabWriter like I always say, they want a movie Batman Forever or Superman IV.
The fun and colorful Batman movie that haters want is Batman Forever. But then they'll tell you how horrible that is.

@ajejelicano although I do admit that Batman Forever was the first movie I saw and I liked Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones in it,
Kinda weird that Batman Forever and Batman and Robin (a.k.a. Bat-Nipples: The Movie) had the same actor for Robin, but two different Batmen.

@RageMichelle @Filmatelist Some people would say that's the best Batman movie, Batman Forever and Batman and Robin were "horrible"
The only movie I've ever been to where people clapped at the end was at The Park Twin in Roswell For Batman Forever.
Tomorrow night, I will remind myself why Batman Forever made me feel anything but the desire to see a Batman movie again for a while.

Batman forever is clearly the best batman movie #fact

I genuinely disliked The Dark Knight. Batman Forever remains my favorite Batman movie. How I Met Your Mother is intolerable. Doritos? No.
@ittatto23 I'm sorry it's just talk about the batman forever movie and the 400 batmobile and the comics of the batmobiles
Even though Batman Forever is such a childish movie I love it so much and will watch it any day.

Watching Batman Forever. Feeling a superhero movie binge coming on.
BATMAN FOREVER didn't need Robin. At all. Once he karate-hangs his laundry, takes Batmobile for joy ride... Ugh
BATMAN FOREVER is a guilty pleasure. Totally falls apart in the end, but first hour is a feast for the eyes: comic book pages come to life!
#TIL Kiss from a Rose by Seal was made for Batman Forever. I've seen the movie a dozen times.

Kiss from a rose! 1995! Batman Forever! Good fuckin movie n song
Sam Smith? Am I the only one here who thought Seal is the obvious choice? Movie soundtrack CV speaks for itself - Batman Forever & Space Jam
I haven’t watched Batman Forever in a long time. It was my 1st Batman movie as a kid, & I really liked it. Robin was in it, so I was down
Batman has at least one @indianmotocycle in his collection in the Batman Forever movie.
Can Any Batman Movie or Game Finish AMAZING? Cause Batman 3rd One is like the last favorite one. TDKR Nope, BAK Nope, Batman Forever Nope.

@Ssnyder1835 Can you do Batman forever too (not like the Val Kilmer movie, but like the comic series)? Pleeeeeease!!!????
If Batman movies were judged exclusively by their soundtracks, Batman Forever would be the greatest Batman movie all time. Then Batman&Robin
His best acting movie is Batman Forever
How can a movie (Batman Forever) have such a great cast yet be so terrible??

Also, Batman & Robin isn't the worst Batman movie. That honor goes to Batman Forever.
TASM2 is like a good movie that got mashed up with the Joel batman movies...Electro is basically the Riddler from Batman Forever
With Batman Forever and this one, more importance was placed on making toys instead of making a good movie.
last time i saw it, i remember hating this movie more than Batman Forever, but it's definitely better than Forever.

i just rewatched Batman Forever and all things considering its not a bad movie
How, apparently Kiss From a Rose came from Batman Forever?! And here I thought it was from some random teenage drama movie
Currently watching batman forever haven't seen the movie in over 12 years all I can say is bad and plenty of face-Palm moments #Batman
That song was in Batman Forever, also known as Val Kilmer's last skinny movie.
Tim Burton was supposed to be the director for batman forever? I don't think that's his style of movie...

@plasko Yay, ! I'm not ashamed to admit Batman Forever is my second favorite movie soundtrack. The original Casino Royale takes first.
@FreddieFrey also when you say Batgirl + movie I think of batman forever.
If I were to describe today as a movie I'd say it was half Office Space, half The Exorcist, accompanied by the Batman Forever soundtrack
I want to complete my batman movie selection but batman forever was somewhat mediocre
Confession: The last time I saw a "Superhero" movie at the theater was....Batman Forever! #shockingiknow #antmanmovie
I wish they would make a good #Batman movie with #Riddler as the villain. Something like from the #Arkham games. Batman forever doesn't fit.

I will always have a soft spot for Batman Forever. Guilty admission. Not that great of a movie but the nostalgia makes it better.
@TwinMadeFilms @maxfolkmax 1.) Remove Batman Forever DVD from the DVD player 2.) Insert a good horror movie DVD 3.) Watch it
I get why 'Kiss From A Rose' is Seal's signature song bc it won Song of the Year and movie it was in (Batman Forever)...
Batman Forever was the greatest Batman movie ever made. Also, I'm pretty sure I'm still half asleep so don't quote me on that.
The Wikipedia entry for Batman Forever is 100x more entertaining than the movie itself. Daniel Day Lewis was in the running to play Batman?

Batman forever on Zee Studio. And it was just Nicole Kidman that was good about movie.Thanks Nolan for giving us a Batman that's not stupid.
I don't care what anyone says, Batman Forever is still my favorite Batman movie <3
This movie is so bad that Joel Schumacher turned it down and he did the Batman Forever #trashtue
… wow, the "Over the Rainbow" cue in the child's headphones? I feel like this movie is to "Batman Forever" as "M:I:2: is to "Batman & Robin"
Maybe Batman Forever was a bad movie, but with that soundtrack it was a net gain for the world.
Batman Forever is the most colourful Batman movie there has been.

@H0nkyfac3 Batman Returns was good. Batman Forever was half good. Then there's Batman and Robin. We don't talk about that movie.
@ScottMurtha screenwriter Akiva Goldsman added it in the movie as a joke cause he wrote Batman Forever and piece of crap Batman and Robin
Jared Leto as The Joker, ugh the more I see stills the more I get excited about this movie bruh. Batman forever.
@CriminalRecords Batman Forever, Purple Rain, Braveheart, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast (both Broadway and movie).
MOVIE TRIVIA: Joel Schumacher loved the idea of an AxlXDuff relationship so much he made a movie about it called Batman Forever.
Great song and a meh-movie. Batman Forever OST Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me https://youtu.be/SMastE7oBMA  via @YouTube

was watching batman forever and thinking there couldn't be a shittier batman movie, then batman & robin came on. @tritontcb
Don't be fooled. The movie "Batman Forever" is only two hours long.
Batman Forever is the worst Batman movie and it's on TV right now. I am so happy.
Worst Batman movie ever? Batman Forever. Worst Batmobile ever? Batman Forever. Worst Batman ever? Val Kilmer.
True Story: Tommy Lee Jones is for real brilliant in Batman Forever. The rest of the movie is goofy but he is awesome.
Laptop is on, Twitter is Twittering. Movie:Joel Schumacher's 1995 first pass at Batman's nipples, Batman Forever. Drink on!

Watching Batman Forever everyday this week cuz it's the best Batman movie.
There was a point in my childhood when #Batman Forever was my favorite movie. Now it's almost painful to watch. Nostalgia is a b sometimes.
Batman Forever the best batman movie or nah?
I just had an epiphany: Batman Forever would have been a totally decent movie if Dr Chase Meridian had turned out to be the villain.
Batman Forever is an absurdly bad movie in a very mid-90s way. It also had a pretty killer soundtrack.
no wonder why i was like "wait..what?" when Robin was already with Batman in "Batman and Robin", i miss the entire Batman forever 1995 movie
Favorite original batman movie out of batman batman returns batman forever and batman&robin go!
The only thing I've taken away from Batman Forever is that Nicole Kidman was perfect in the 90s and TLJ really tried to make this movie good

The opening credits of BATMAN FOREVER are like a way shitty version of the opening credits of SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE!!!!!
Favorite movie growing up is now on Netflix, Batman Forever
Batman Forever is now on Netflix. That's with Tommy lee jones as two face and Jim Carry as the riddler. Such an awful movie, yet I love it
Tommie Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Val Kilmer, Chris ODonnell, Nicole Kidman, Drew Barrymore.. Good movie right? Nope, just Batman Forever.
On Netflix Batman Returns is a dark movie while Batman forever is a goofy movie lmao
Batman Forever is on Netflix, woohoo! Worst part of the movie is Batman imo, best part are jim carry and tommy lee jones
of course I gotta watch batman forever right now, it's only 6am. (dat before work, movie flow)
How how HOW do people think Batman Forever is not a good movie?!
Batman Forever is a stupid movie. Sorry Val. #batman #BatmanForever #batmanfail

Batman Forever bruh. Tommy Lee Jones & Jim Carrey are the only reason this movie has always been a favorite of mine.
Im trying to decide if Batman Forever is the worst or best Batman movie ever made.
batman forever is the worst movie of all time I LOVE IT

Batman Forever such a dope movie
No movie can ever fuck with Batman Forever, and that's real shit
High af watching Batman Forever. This is my favorite Batman movie of all of them.
Batman Forever.... Favorite Batman movie ever. Yesss
And Batman and Robin RT @SoNinJR: Batman Forever is forever a terrible movie
I forgot that in Batman Forever, Batman for like 98% of the movie is "You can't murder Two-Face, Robin" then STRAIGHT UP MURDERS TWO-FACE.
@indiewinter i can like a song more than a movie! no one alive likes batman forever more than kiss from a rose, i guarantee!
Jim Carreys best role was The Riddler in batman Forever. Horrible movie, but he made it funny.
I love how Batman Forever looks like a comic. I'm so happy to be watching my childhood movie!!
The live-action movie versions of Robin are always odd. It's weird having adult boy wonders. Chris O'Donnell was 25 for Batman Forever.
Watching Batman Forever. Made me think of @joeymcintyre. He should have dressed as The Riddler for movie night on the Cruise! ;-D

On the #CruiseToSnooze tonight, we have Seal's "Kiss from a Rose" from the movie Batman Forever AND Elvis Costello's "She" from Notting Hill
@nevverdaily "I have the best idea for a new Batman movie: Batman Forever!" "Awesome title. You got a script?" "A what now?"
This tweet is phrased such that it seems like USPS created stamps to commemorate awful Batman Forever movie. https://twitter.com/nevverdaily/status/525010556458401792 …
It's dumb as rocks, but I think Batman Forever is my favorite live action Batman movie. Comic booky without going all the way stupid.

Watching BATMAN FOREVER. Does Two-Face always refer to himself as "we" and "us?" I mean, outside of this movie.
The Cheesiness is the reason why Batman Forever, is the best Batman movie!

@mrchooch2u I beg to differ. Batman Forever might be my fourth favorite Batman movie.
Aside from The Dark Knight, Batman Forever is by far my favorite Batman movie
Who's idea was it to show me Batman Forever as my first comic book movie?! And make me watch X2 before watching the first X-Men?!
I was such a bad DC fan back in the day. I mean, it's not totally my fault. My first Batman movie was Batman Forever
At least they let you know early on what kind of movie your getting. But then you probably saw Batman Forever first, so... #BatNips
@BatgirlChessie my first Batman movie was Batman Forever. Why would they do that to me?!

@Gingerhazing U2 has a song that plays over the credits of Batman Forever and I once sat through that movie on TV just to hear it.

Batman Forever is on. This movie makes me want a new Batman 66 movie soooo much.

Is it bad that I actually enjoyed the Batman and Robin movie? Batman forever... The one everyone hated... Haha

@NewCenturyShaw With the exception of "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind", I haven't enjoyed a Jim Carrey movie since "Batman Forever".
I wonder if Val Kilmer kind of finds it ironic that the ONE Batman movie he starred in was called BATMAN FOREVER.
Until Guardians of the Galaxy, I had not bought a movie soundtrack since Batman Forever.
@ActorTrivia And funny thing is, my favorite Batman movie of the '89-'97, is Batman Forever I like the Michael Keaton ones, well '89 film.

The first PG-13 movie I ever saw in the theater - "Batman Forever" at the Chillicothe Regal 4. Seriously. #BatmanDay #Batman75
Batman Forever is a below average Batman movie, but it's a good Jim Carrey movie.
What Batman movie should I watch tonight? Batman 1966, Batman, Batman Returns or Batman Forever?
@Kiujazi The one with michelle phiefer as Catwoman right? It was an okay movie, but I prefer Batman Forever.
...Batman Returns, Batman The Movie (1966), Batman Forever That's it Batman & Robin doesn't go on there for obvious reasons....
The main problem I have with the movie is the villains. I thought Electro's back story reminded me of Riddlers backstory in Batman Forever

Film pertama yang ditonton bioskop 'Batman Forever' deh kayaknya. Eh, atau 'Power Rangers The Movie' ya? Lupa.

@JarettSays @robmoynihan Batman Forever is the Batman movie I've seen the most. I may have seen it 50 times. (Was on TV all the time)
@JarettSays Batman Forever is a GREAT movie.
I guess with Batman Forever they were trying to go for a Dick Sprang era comic book movie but, you know, with nipples.
Batman Forever is my new favorite movie, just saying #MTVhottest @5SOS
Batman Forever is not a good movie. Dissappointing
Batman Forever school of movie making
You know, Batman Forever is an unappreciated movie. Batman and Robin, on the other hand, is a crime against humanity.
@3WishGenie @BBohaty Yea I'm pretty sure Harvey Dent is in the first Batman movie but is African American. In Batman Forever he is white
@_mscathia @DisDistracted worst movie. I'd rather watch Batman Forever.

@WBEZmorning come now, you can't talk terrible movie w/iconic songs w/o mentioning Batman Forever
I wanted to watch batman forever so I went to put it into my DVD player but my best friends wedding was there & I cant say no to that movie
Cody Rhodes's Stardust persona reminds me of Jim Carrey's Riddler from the 1990's movie Batman Forever. #RAW
I completely forgot about Batman Forever, even though Val Kilmer is arguably the hottest Batman his movie sucked ass
I just found out The Smashing Pumpkins made a song for Batman Forever. This movie is officially a perfect, beautiful classic. Stay...COOL.
Batman Forever is that movie that i watched a million times as a child, that i can quote it verbatim now. /notproud.
@D_Huff66 I do believe Batman Forever was the highest grossing movie of 1995.
Batman Forever is probably the worst batman film ever made. Similar to superman returns and also the most recent green lantern movie

Watching Batman Forever for the first time in over ten years. I used to love this movie. I'm not sure why...
There was this one time that my dad tried to tell me Val Kilmer didn't star in the 1995 Batman Forever movie with Jim Carrey.
Watching batman forever w/ van Kilmer and his rowdy gang of villians, tommy and Jim !! i crack myself up #movie#120of900
Currently watching one of everyone's least favorite Batman movies, Batman Forever. This is the ultimate nostalgia movie for me.
Movie of the Day: Batman Forever, it's got so many flaws but it's still better then Batman and Robin
Was just reminded by way of conversation with @j2sheck & @kthewolf that the Batman Forever soundtrack is crazy awesome. Movie still sucks.
God. I feel like watching a Batman movie. Any one. Maybe Batman Forever.
I love Batman Forever and everyone can kiss my ass it's a WONDERFUL movie

I don't think I should have read The Killing Joke right before watching Batman Forever because man that movie is not good
I think batman forever is the gayest movie I have ever seen which is code for "oh god I love it"
In the mid '90s I really wanted Batman to be portrayed by @akaWorf. The movie in my head was better than "Batman Forever," I promise.

BATMAN FOREVER is still the best Batman movie. Don't even try to make a case for any of the others.
@torontobatman Better for batman forever? no. but if Nolan was to do another movie where the villain was the riddler then most definitely!
@DCComics my favorite Batman movie character is Batman in Batman Forever played by Val Kilmer #dcaagiveaway
Jamie Foxx in Amazing Spiderman 2 IS Edward Nygma from Batman Forever. Exact same story. Also this movie blows.
@thafreshstkd305 @DillonH_6531 @SouthernDrawl8 @oooKARENooo Okay Batman forever... Even though that movie sucked.
#nw Batman Forever. This movie never stops being awesome
@DCComics even if it wasn't the greatest batman movie I liked the the batmobile toy from batman forever lit up
I honestly believe that over time people will come to realize Batman Forever is a worse movie than Batman and Robin. #pointlessconfessions
Despite the movie for Batman Forever being pretty terrible, the soundtrack for it is super solid and still holds up over these years.
I only liked the batman forever movie with Two Face and The Riddler. Idk why.
i never get tired of batman forever. it's my favorite batman movie.
Batman Forever is the absolute best movie to me. I LOVE it!! Watching it now!!!
So i just watched Batman Forever and i realized this movie is as old as me xD
Watching Batman Forever !! I love this movie!! It never ceases to amaze me ! ^-^
Batman Forever: good, my son now agrees that the movie is terrible and has switched off. On to sport. (father's hidden agenda)
Another nomination for most 90s movie is Batman Forever with a soundtrack featuring the quadfecta of Seal, U2, Offspring, and Flaming Lips!

There's a part in Batman Forever where Jim Carrey's Riddler says "Joygasm!" It's an already bad movie that hasn't aged well
Best Batmans: 1. Morrisons run. 2. 66' Movie 3. 66' Series 4. Batman & Robin 5. Batman Forever. This is the unarguable list, sorry.
@TheBatmanDark @BatmanOfNight Interesred in a pair of etched glass Batman Forever McDonald's movie tie ins? Batman & Riddler $10 for both.
Batman Forever is such a good movie
Say what you want about the movie itself, Elliot Goldenthal's Batman Forever score is badass.
Nicole Kidman in Batman Forever was my 1st big-time movie crush. That led me to sneak into To Die For, which was my 1st Gus Van Sant flick.
batman forever is hands down my favorite batman movie.
TIL I'm not the only one who loved the Batman Forever Soundtrack. Movie sucked. http://bzfd.it/1nXzKFd

Batman Forever had the greatest movie soundtrack ever. Start out with a solid U2 single, then gradually lead into Kiss From A Rose???
If I were to bring a lady over and put on a romantic movie to set the mood, I'd choose only the best of romance, "Batman Forever".
In this empty theater two idiots decided to sit behind me and go off on their dumb movie opinions. One guy likes Batman Forever more than DK

Even though batman forever was a shitty movie Jim Carey as the Riddler is fucking genius
Also, there's an interesting essay to be written on Batman Forever somewhere. Just like I'm sure there's a good movie in there too. Maybe.
Batman Forever #BBCAmerica not a bad movie for its time.
Batman Forever is my favorite Batman movie, shit is dope.
I feel like Jim Carrey was the only actor who showed up on the set of Batman Forever and knew exactly what level of movie they were making
Batman & Robin <<<<<<< Batman Forever. But both of these??? <<<<< EVERY MOVIE EVER.
Batman Forever is truly an awful movie
Batman Forever has to be one of the best Batman movies I ever seen. Jim Carey made that movie awesome
Watching Batman Forever this movie still go hard
Batman Forever is on BBCA. I love this movie only for The Riddler

Marathoning them all is forcing me to admit that "Batman Forever", (my lifelong favorite!), is... not the best batman movie.

NO. BATMAN FOREVER IS MY NO.1 What's the best Batman movie? Our definitive ranking from worst to best http://go.dspy.me/dg3  via @digitalspy
BATMAN FOREVER was not a "good" movie, but it was at least a different approach. Movie series should do more like that.
@TheRealDonEast Brave and the Bold Batman forever. Lego movie Bats totally works as the very competent foil to Emmett though
Best Batman movie for me is either The Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises. Batman Forever and Batman & Robin... just no.
Every Chris Nolan Batman movie was good only in comparison to Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.
6th Favorite Bat Movie... Batman Forever. Val Kilmer wasn't too bad, not a fan of TLJ's Two-face or the god awful Bane. Crappy name too.
Lmaoooooooo!!! RT @BlkEricForman: Lmao RT @DT905: The Batman movie where Seal was singing (Batman Forever) my fav Batman movie of all time

In the batman v superman: dawn of justice movie batman is going to win!! Batman forever and always!! @TheBatman
It should probably be noted that the best live-action fight scene in a Batman movie has come from BATMAN FOREVER. And it was Robin's fight.
@17Jolt Batman Forever is the Batmaniest movie we've ever gotten. Campy as it gets, but not idiotic like & ROBIN.
Batman Forever is an awesome movie
Really hate the bat mobile in Batman forever the movie is a literal let down in every aspect
If @ChaseECallahan was a Batman movie he'd be Batman Forever, the most sensitive of the Batman movies.

ahhh batman forever movie this pm! reminded me of my college days in the big city. #gma7
nakakatawa yung movie na batman forever
So this movie is really grounded and realistic until we show up at the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants hideout and it's suddenly Batman Forever.
Green Lantern tho. Straight up, infinitely better then the film. Movie was way of Batman Forever & Daredevil. As in, 'WTF man, wut was dat?'
Batman forever is such a terrible movie but George Clooney tho.
@Shake_Well The Batman Forever soundtrack is far more enjoyable than the movie, that's for sure.
Came to mind b/c I'm watching the best Batman (Val Kilmer) in the best Batman movie ever Batman Forever.
Ugh! Spiderman 2 not terrible, but not great either. This movie recycles stuff from Batman Forever, Superman 3, & the other Spiderman movies
Batman Forever currently. i loved this movie when i was younger.

@blamethelabel Under-rated movie soundtrack? "Batman Forever". Seriously.
@morsecodetim It's because the narrative so god awful. I mean the movie had to three different tones, Electro does pull Batman Forever.
Anyone comparing Amazing Spider-Man 2 to Batman Forever didn't see the same movie I did.
@Magnum_Steelrod the whole movie is just so inconsistent. It doesn't know whether it should be 500 days of summer or Batman Forever
*Batman Forever ends* (10 seconds go by) *laptop dies* It was SO in God's plan for me to finish this movie #blessed
batman forever's soundtrack was arguably one of the best movie soundtracks.
@edgarwright Batman Forever. Jim Morrison and Doc Holliday were Batman. Chris O'Donnell grieved. All I need in a movie.

@PhilipHalpin2 in batman Forever,and the tone of the movie was all over the place,why do u think this movie has 50%on RT
Watched ASM2... one day, Marvel will get the rights and make a movie that makes you say "oh, I see now." ASM2 will be the Batman Forever.
So, I dug ASM2...but one part did seem very "Batman Forever" and took me right out of the movie for a bit. Might not be the scene you think
@linz128 (the movie itself had a very Batman Forever vibe to it, and I thought it was pretty boring in places)
Worst superhero movie in several years. Someone watched too much Batman Forever. Mark Webb, you are not good at this #AmazingSpiderman2
@rodimusprime @insanityreport @Fanntastic81 Dude, Rob Liefield literally said this movie was too much like Batman Forever and Batman/Robin.
RT @ShawnaWTF: Most disappointing movie of all time is ______? Spiderman 3, Batman Returns, Batman Forever (NEVER), M.I.B 2 & 3, X-Men
the worst til batman and robin came along. RT @marcyville: Batman Forever was such a terrible movie lol.
It's not a good sign when the movie they use to compare to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is Batman Forever. #BatmanForeverisunderrated
Willingly watching Batman Forever. My favourite Cheesy Superhero movie. Could be worse. Could be Batman and Robin. Wish me luck.
Seriously. TASM2, The Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises, Spider-Man 3, the first Wolverine movie, Batman Forever, Batman & Robin,Green Lantern
batman and robin movie sucks forever and batman forever dont.
We talk about Batman Forever. Is it the best Batman movie or the BEST? The show will be up on, uh, Monday? I should listen better.
Honestly, I feel more up for a Spider-Man movie that rips off Batman Forever than one that rips off other Spider-Man movies. #optimism
Batman Forever is my favorite Batman movie
It’s like Marc Webb took 500 Days of Summer and Batman Forever, smashed them to pieces, then glued them together into one movie.
I've seen quite a few movie reviewers say Amazing Spider-Man 2 is as good as Batman Forever and just a bit better than Batman and Robin.
There is a lot to like about this movie. The scenes with Spidey being Spidey are really great. Buuuut other parts felt kinda Batman Forever
@mrbrianfirenzi Batman forever should have been the title of the fourth movie.
My favourite quote about the movie so far is "It's worse than BATMAN FOREVER but slightly better than BATMAN & ROBIN."

I'll forever be upset that, after Batman Forever, there wasn't a movie law dictating that all second sequels be named "________ Forever"
Just ordered Batman Forever and Batman and Robin on Bluray. Just one more movie and my Batman movie collection is complete omggggg :D
@srkswarrior1 ya nolans tdk was classic....but should watch batman forever now on utv action ...best comedy movie
Batman forever was a decent movie.. @GipsonAndrew : c'mon they gave the batsuit nipples!
The noses on the TMNT for the new movie are like the nipples on the Batsuits in Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Unnecessary. #tmnt2014
When any one mentions 'a Batman movie' my first thought is always Batman Forever.

@RetroGameGeeks @Club_SEGA One of the BEST Movie based video games from the 90s!!! Batman Forever = probably the worst!
Things I regret: Getting hooked on cigarettes. Causing my parents undue stress. Paying to see Batman Forever at the local movie theater.
I also thought batman forever was the best movie ever when I was 8 and saw it in theaters

I love Jim Carrey, but he was absolutely horrible as the Riddler in Batman Forever (then again, that whole movie was horrible already)
Call me crazy but best Batman movie ever: Batman Forever
@ceilck Like, there's no point in that movie where anyone watching said, "Yes!! Now he's Batman...FOREVER!" What does that even mean?
Batman and Robin was a better movie than Batman Forever. Bring it.
I wonder what #GeorgeClooney was thinking when he said yes to Batman Forever? Some of the outtakes would have been better than movie
@nomadixxx The whole movie gave me Batman Forever flashbacks.
Judge Dredd - bad movie, but nowhere near as bad as Batman Forever.

@Real_Liam_Payne What is the favorite Batman movie? Batman What is the second favorite movie? Batman returns And third? Batman Forever
Even though Batman Forever is not that good of a movie, Billy Bob Thornton and Jim Carey are hilarious
Watching Batman Forever. Still think this suit (first half of the movie) is really awesome. And the Batmobile is still my favorite.
Batman Forever is on right now. Loved this movie back in the day
Everyone hates "batman forever" but I have to say it's my favorite batman movie besides the new one
@colonelmortimer Overrated maybe but lest we forget when BATMAN FOREVER was considered a good super hero movie.
Ive never seen Batman Forever until now, but this movie is pure shit.
Turned my TV on batman forever was on the movie channels
Have you ever seen one actor save a movie like @JimCarrey in Batman Forever?
"Batman Forever" is my favorite Batman movie.
@team2winchester @phoenix_ranger I like him in Batman Forever honestly. I had a thing for him in that even know the movie doesn't hold up.
@cfgodwell @jonathanjstone0 @hellresidentNY Can I just say that Batman Forever is the one movie nerds can collectively agree SUCKED?
Listen to @BlackGirlNerds, @hellresidentNY. That's one bad movie. Oh wait...I forgot Batman Forever. THAT was s**t on a summer sidewalk
Watching Batman Forever. Classic. If you haven't heard @ThatKevinSmith's podcast commentary on this movie it's hilarious.
@advodude I decided to be straight when I saw Nicole Kidman in BATMAN FOREVER. So, ya know, I owe that movie something, anyway.
@DanSlott 2 years later do you have changed opinions on the Amazing Spidey movie? The second one is pretty bad like Batman Forever campy
@SpencerIrvine I mean people gave big problems a pass bc it was a superman movie like they did batman forever but then director given blank
Batman forever is probably the worst movie I've ever seen
Batman forever is a horrible movie compared to Bateman beginzzz
Batman forever is the weirdest fuckin movie ever Nicole Kidmans character is just a whore her whole angle and she's awful who casted this
Batman forever is such a cheesy movie and I used to watch it everyday as a kid jfc
Is my 3-year-old too young to see Batman Forever? I'm just not sure he's mature enough to understand how bad this movie really is.
Batman forever will forever be my favorite movie!
Batman Eternal almost sounds like Batman Forever. Luckily the comic is way better than the movie.

It's sad that Seal's "Kiss from a Rose" music video was a better Batman movie than Batman Forever.

Christian Bale auditioned for the role of Robin in the Batman Forever movie but the part was given to Chris O'Donnell.
@ryanedwards84 Batman Forever had its redeeming qualities. It's still an interesting movie despite the campiness. BandR on the other hand..
Jim Carrey's best movie is Batman Forever. The Riddler is a bad ass
Batman Forever use to be like my favorite movie when I was little lol

Whether you liked the movie or not, gotta give Batman Forever soundtrack extra credit for giving us Kiss from a Rose... #Batman75
Michael Bay isn't directing the new TMNT movie, Jonathan Liebesman is. You wouldn't call Batman Forever a Tim Burton movie. C'MON.
@wyshynski having Batman Forever as the 4th best Batman movie is confusing it's an E.Nigma wrapped in a Riddle(r).
#Batman75 my first Batman movie was Batman Forever XD
Dear Val Kilmer, you were the worst Batman ever. Also, Batman Forever was the worst movie ever. Sincerely, Disappointed lol
I think I'm so attached to Batman Forever because it was the first movie my parents and I saw together in theaters. Weird, I know.

@LeftoverCulture Back to the Future Part 3, Batman Forever, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Lawnmower Man. All movie tie-ins...hmmm?

Yir da’s Tumblr review of The Lego Movie ends with “…it also happens to be the best Batman movie since Batman Forever”.
Watched the 1995 movie "Batman Forever". Jim Carrey should've won the award for worst overacting performance that year. Annoying as hell.
Batman forever isn't even that long of a movie
If you feel like cursing the movie gods, "Batman Forever" is on. There's a special place in Hell for Joel Schumacher.
Batman Forever is my favorite Batman movie. It's nostalgic futuristic perspective is parallel to the present. And it's comicy and dramatic.
