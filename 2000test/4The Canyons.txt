@barneystoneage @nicolestwat last Lindsay movie "the canyons" $100. A day. Last Jen movie tens of millions
I mean the Canyons was a shit movie, I might watch it to mock it though because it's shit
I am having a whiplash after watching The Canyons, which actually wasn't a bad movie, because he isn't a great actor (or a pornstar).
@NotAllBhas they also worked together on a movie, the canyons, starting Lindsay lohan
@NightmarEclipse @NORMIESREEEEE @DrtyHippiePanda @theleakymind Hmm good movie..... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klMajIhX3bY … it inspired this by the way
I’ve seen a movie starring James Deen and the shame is almost too great to bear (THE CANYONS).

@michaelcm89 I'm unfamiliar with his work outside of the American Psycho movie and the Canyons so I'm looking into getting his books now
Know when you see a movie & say "this role comes natural to this person"? I felt that seeing @JamesDeen in The Canyons. He's TOO good @ evil
Sadly, this @JamesDeen fiasco isn't shocking. In The Canyons (which I thought was a good movie), he plays a REALLY fucked up dude very well.
The canyons was a hella movie.
James Deen's alleged behavior sounds identical to his character in the Canyons, which is horrifying since that was a horror movie
The Canyons was a missed opportunity but the movie soundtrack was pretty sick. #OnRepeat #ScriptingInProcess http://fb.me/Vg7Jp5Ot 
@Zee_Violator I watched that the Canyons movie. He's kind of scary.
@FelixBorowiak he was in that movie with Lindsey Lohan called the "Canyons"
So I only knew who @JamesDeen was b/c of the AWFUL movie The Canyons...He's a terrible actor & apparently a terrible person in general

@scottstev I've never seen 'The Canyons.' I'd rather be hung for witch craft than sit through a Lindsey Lohan movie. (The Parent Trap aside)
That character James Deen played in the movie The Canyons fit him like a glove because he's a horrible person.
@Lips_Loose Oh, James DEAN, I thought it was about The Canyons star James Deen. Different movie.
@JulieOfcharsky James Deen was in that terrible Lindsay Lohan movie The Canyons hahaha he's the worst actor I've ever seen!
THE CANYONS WAS HIGHKEY THE SHITTEST MOVIE I EVER SAT THROUGH @JamesDeen

If you're going to go back and watch any movie today it should be The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan. It truly is a tremendous pile of dog shit.
The Canyons a movie made in losangles staring Lindsey Lohan https://youtu.be/UpiroToLues

"The Canyons" (2013) is a lame movie (D) #AhiMovieReviews <nw9t0y>
The Canyons is my favorite horror movie.
The canyons with @lindsaylohan was a well made movie a little too realistic for my taste tho ... She was great though!!!
THE CANYONS is really a movie with James Deen and Lindsay Lohan, directed by Paul Schrader?
Don't watch The Canyons on Netflix. I'm warning you. Literally the saddest & most disturbing movie ever made.
The Canyons is definitely a strange movie. Lindsay Lohan is too different and that James Deen porn star is a horrible actor.
@sailoremma watch the movie the canyons on netflix she's in it its decent!
And Lindsay's comeback has been amazing. InAPPropriate Comedy, The Canyons and Scary Movie 5 are all great, great movies. Should watch.
really wanna watch The Canyons movie
@Y_Strahovski ...Your scaring me!...This one REALLY looks like the movie The Canyons!..Please be careful!!!
@Y_Strahovski ...Be careful out there!!!...I watched this movie called the Canyons and now camping out scares me!
Hey @lindsaylohan, I just seen your movie "The Canyons" on Netflix last night and loved it! I'm still a big fan if yours
That movie that came out last decade that had that male pornstar sucks just like the canyons
The Canyons is on Netflix if you're looking for a good horror movie.
@drugproblem Her comeback for me was her role in The Canyons. I love that movie.
I just watched The Canyons on Netflix. Why does everyone hate this movie? I really liked it. Am I crazy? AM I CRAZY??
so i'm finally getting around to watching The Canyons but I think the movie thinks it's actually good so this might be a challenge
MY FAVORITE MOVIE THE CANYONS FT. MY QUEEN @lindsaylohan IS ON @netflix
It seems like a perfect night for a movie. Unwind in the canyons with everyone's favorite classic, The Goonies.... http://fb.me/6Q1N8BHTY 
The Canyons may be the worst movie I've ever seen and I love it. Lindsay Lohan is so underrated as a drag queen
Also the canyons was a horrible movie and I don't even know how I was able to finish it.
The canyons is a good movie.

It was interesting though. If anyone wants a movie. Watch The Canyons if you're into freaky shit
Watched The Canyons & noticed it was made by the producers of American Psycho. Which makes sense cuz it was a porno killing type of movie

The canyons is such a good movie, don't know why y'all hated it !
The Canyons is a movie where James Deen outshines everyone but also is a terrible character archetype and it's not interesting. Just tits.
I told @jimlaidler how much work I'm doing on my movie, his response: "I don't even think they spent that long on The Canyons!"

@bobbyditta lol that was the thesis of the canyons, yeah? (I loved that movie tbch)
'The Canyons' is a good movie if you want to see Lindsay Lohan's puffy face, James Deen's giant wiener & subpar acting for about 2 hrs. 

THE CANYONS IS A GOOD MOVIE OKAY
The Canyons is another bad movie but at least it has some old fashioned nudity.
Even though I didn't really care for the Canyons the movie, I enjoyed seeing Lindsay Lohan.

I watched the movie 'The Canyons' last night. Yup, I sure did. That's all I got to say about that.
I thought that THE CANYONS would be the worst movie I watched this week. I might be wrong. #BattleOfTheYear
So THE CANYONS isn't interesting. But it's a movie written by the guy who wrote the only movie I've ever walked out of, and I finished it.
The Canyons is basically a David Lynch movie scripted by Paris Hilton and acted by a bunch of dead eyes porn stars. A must see.
Well, I wish her much luck! #LindsayLohan #Movie -> RT @DazedMagazine: So The Canyons opens in London this weekend: http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/18294/1/the-hottest-cinematic-messes …

steve agrees with my proposal that the canyons is like a companion movie to cosmopolis, as everything that happened outside the car
Watching The Canyons. It is like every scene is the intro to a Skinemax movie.
I love Bret Easton Ellis, but The Canyons is terrible. No comeback for Lohan. No good movie has yet to come from Kickstarter.
Brett Easton Ellis's movie The Canyons w/ Lindsay Lohan is utterly without merit.
The 32 minutes I spent watching "The Canyons" last night were some of my worst movie minutes ever.

saw the act of killing today, haven't wanted a movie to end so badly in a long time and I saw the canyons this weekend. harrowing.
This movie the Bellas booked? The Canyons. #TotalDivas
If THE CANYONS is about the death of the movie industry then THE ROOM was about a scrappy football team.

@franzferdinand2 In movie gossip news, I am super disappointed that THE CANYONS appears to be boring instead of an insane misfire.

Is 'The Canyons' a sleazy wallow or a good movie? Or both? And can it salvage the career of Lindsay Lohan? http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/08/05/can-the-canyons-save-lindsay-lohan/ … via @EW

Though every movie should be judged good/bad on its own merits, I can't imagine how anyone who's read Ellis's work wouldn't get THE CANYONS.
And thus ends The Canyons, a movie where BEE is most self-indulgent: shallow story, the odd orgy, nothing happens, someone dies horribly.

i liked the Canyons movie. James Deen was trying to be Ryan Phillippe from Cruel Intentions but still.
[REVIEW] THE CANYONS (5/10): This movie is overdramatic & ridiculous. Lindsay Lohan is very good, without her this movie could be worse.
'The Canyons' sigh. Barely a movie. More like a Whitney Biennial video piece about bad writing, acting and direction. A bad biennial piece.

The Canyons: A kinda- empty, cold, and dead movie about boredom and struggles in LA. Beautifully shot despite its low budget
Watched The Canyons. Best part of that movie is still the NY Times article about how absurd the process of making it was.

@lindsaylohan @Marcela_Silvah she is doing a Bret Easton Ellis film called the canyons which looks amazing. And scary movie 5
@BretEastonEllis Saw The50's trailer for The Canyons. That thing is about to be the best movie ever! Silver Linings? I hate theEagles.
I don't care if Lindsay Lohan is starring in it, The Canyons is my movie debut, watch me.. :) http://twitpic.com/bgs9t7 
@JamesDeen Is The Canyons, like... A piss take or something or is it a serious movie?
To be fair, we WERE talking about The Canyons, that movie Lindsay Lohan is doing with him.
The things I do for The Canyons cast: watched last week's Glee, and for the first time Tomorrow Night I Will Be Watching A Lifetime Movie...

These awful teaser trailers for The Canyons (Lohan's new "movie") make me think the director has a Billy Walsh (of Entourage) complex.
