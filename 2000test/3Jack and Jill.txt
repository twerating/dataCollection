@imbostontom jack and Jill is the worst movie you've seen really????? it's hilarious
Whenever I get sad, I think about the part in Jack and Jill, when Jill loudly eats popcorn in movie theater and upsets everyone around her.
@c_weckesser he also thought jack and jill was a good movie
@MariskaMovement @Mariska LOL! The song is the "theme" song for Jack and Jill (Adam sandler movie)
I think the only way I can be angrier at a movie than I was at Jack and Jill is if it's destroying something I love.
I mean, at that point it would HAVE to be intentional right. To make a movie worse than Jack and Jill, you have to try.

Adam Sandler should make his own Avengers-like team-up movie with Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Zohan, Jack and Jill and the Waterboy.
Adam Sandler's 2011 film "Jack and Jill" won every single Razzie award possible. That's your definition of world's worst movie ever.

PIXELS at least has the excuse of being a CGI-heavy action movie. But JACK AND JILL is just a no-frills trashy comedy.
Also when ur gonna school a nerd on what a good romcom is (and also watch the spongebob squarepants movie and Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill)
For perspective, Jack and Jill, the movie you already forgot where Sandler played his female twin made more money. https://twitter.com/Variety/status/625524035741290499 …
"That's my boy"is the worst happy Madison movie I've seen. It even worse then "jack and Jill."

@NateWantsToBtl id rather watch jack and Jill 7 more times than watch a perfect movie plot be wasted by Adam Sandler
Here's a short horror story to ruin your Saturday night: Jack and Jill (the Adam Sandler movie where he plays both) grossed $74,000,000.
Jack and Jill had a budget of 75 Million. that movie looks like it had 2 Million actually invested into the movie
@BlazingGator @DekuNite What did you expect with a movie staring Jack AND Jill, Blart, and Olaf
Adam Sandler's Pixels movie opened this weekend but I still don't think he's ever apologized for Jack and Jill.
@TheWillTommo @Termulus Any Sandler movie up to Jack and Jill was funny
@Kayshire_Cat I heard it's Sandler's second worst movie after only Jack and Jill. That's REALLY bad
@LoganVanWinkle jack and jill. Quality movie.

If the new @cineworld website were a movie, it would be Jack and Jill starring Adam Sandler.
@Brandon95Wood the past 12 years. Like what has his career come to when he agrees to make Jack and Jill. It's a kids movie that kids hate...
Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill movie was amazing ok nobody tell me otherwise
Not surprised that #PixelsMovie is getting bad reviews. Does anybody expect a Sandler movie to be good anymore after 2011's Jack and Jill.
@LightUpTheU Did you even watch Jack and Jill? That was lazy and borderline offensive to the intellectual capacity of movie goers.
@DiazYamisel damnit I just got his movie jack and jill too
Worst movie jack and Jill @ChrisVernonShow @Jon_Roser
Jack and Jill is such a bad movie
Yes! Their review of Jack and Jill is a classic so I'm hoping another Sandler movie review will be just as good https://twitter.com/VanguardComic/status/624099664942473216 …
@DUBZVOICES @cinemasins my guess, if it is Sandler, is Jack and Jill. That "movie" deserves 21 minutes, considering it's a 10 hr commercial.

Jack and Jill is the most racist movie since Birth of a Nation"
Read a review this morning saying Pixels is Sandler's worse movie since Jack and Jill. Not sure if I should take that as a challenge or not.
People are gonna shit on Pixels, but at this point, any Sandler movie is better than Jack and Jill.
Jack and Jill is without a doubt the worst Adam Sandler movie I've ever seen

@11Mwright Jack and Jill was a genius idea, why play one impossibly annoying character when you can play two in the SAmE mOVIe.
Yup, Jack and Jill is Adam Sandler's worst movie of all time.

I'm so happy Jack and Jill is on TV. It's an Adam Sandler classic, if not, an American classic movie.

@UltraMegaFat Jack and Jill is my mother's favorite movie, if you ever needed an explanation as to why I am terribly not funny.
I think Jack and Jill was released as a joke rather than the movie having jokes. Adam Sandler did it as a sort of avant-garde production.

@ItsGarretSelves since 2008 he's just been downhill I'd say his worst movie was jack and Jill because it's the worst movie I've ever seen

Jack and Jill is a debatably better movie than most of your personal favourite movies.

About to watch Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill. If I die anytime soon, this movie will be the reason why.
They're making a movie about the coke polar bears. Still won't have as much product placement as Jack and Jill
My mom thinks my new book is great. That said, she also loved the movie "Jack and Jill" so take all that with a grain of salt.
Which is fitting since the film featured an Adam Sandler movie trailer which looks even worse than Jack and Jill.
*Kanye* "I'm gonna let yall finish...But sorry Jack and Jill, The Hangover II was the worst movie of all time!"
Adam Sandler is coming out with a new movie that will be worse than Jack and Jill. With that disgusting Drew Barrymore. God I hate Hollywood
jack and jill is probably the funniest movie ever #loveadamsandler
@MartialHorror Er, comedy directors arent the ones who run out of scary ideas...bad wording on my part...unless your movie is "Jack and Jill
Before seeing anchorman 2, I had to see @JeremyJahns opinion on the movie just in case the movie was another jack and Jill caliber movie.
If you haven't guessed, I watched the trailer for his new movie "Blended". It's no "Jack and Jill"...but it still looks terrible.

Midnight movie : Jack and Jill
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down, broke his crown and it was still funnier than Adam Sandler's movie.
Adam Sandler is my favorite actor/comedian. He made one bad movie and everyone swears he fell off @ Jack and Jill.
Watching Jack and Jill. Its stupidest movie ever.
Jack and Jill is even more of a piece of shit movie than a movie that's just a shot of a piece of shit

Everything ends badly with me... Why. On the bright side I'm watching Jack and Jill. I enjoy this movie.
Grown Ups 2 was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. ZERO laughs. At least Jack and Jill had the Al Pacino commercial at the end.
Omfg johnny depp is wearing a @justinbieber t-shirt @ jack and jill #movie #fangirling
there's this movie 'Jack and Jill' and Johnny Depp is in it and he is wearing a shirt with Justin on it omg
I cannot believe "Jack and Jill" is in the $5 movie bin. That is just such an insult. I mean who is going to spend $5 on that movie?
Adam Sandler, who played two roles in the Jack and Jill movie, was awarded Golden Raspberry as both the worst actor and the worst actress.
@lukevalmurray I'd genuinely rather watch that movie about a car wheel that kills people then jack and Jill
